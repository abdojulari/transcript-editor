  *  UID is a Unique Identifier assigned to each file created in the database. UIDs are also used to generate URLs for individual pages. Your UID should be a very shorthand version of your item title that will make sense to an end user if they were reading a URL. Your UID should:
<br />
<ul>
  <li>- be maximum 50 characters</li>
  <li>- not have any spaces</li>
  <li>- only include characters that are letters, numbers, underscore (_) and hyphen (-)</li>
</ul>
For example, if your item is titled 'Interview with Jane Citizen [Part 1]', an acceptable UID would be 'jane_citizen_part1'.
