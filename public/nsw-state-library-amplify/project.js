While we would love you to jump in and get involved in correcting our computer-generated transcripts, you can also just simply listen to and enjoy an audio file by clicking the “Play All” button. The Amplify player will run through the transcript as you listen along and if you like you can begin correcting at any point within an audio file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDo I need to be logged in to contribute?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Anyone can contribute at any time without logging in. If you do choose to log in, you’ll be able to see all the edits you’ve made when you return the next time. This can be useful if you’re working on a long transcript and would like to return to it later. Your work is always automatically saved regardless of whether or not you’re logged in.

We display total progress made by the community in the transcript. Since we require several people to edit each transcript, the overall progress will appear less than your individual progress.

In this case, please use the flagging mechanism. By clicking on the flag symbol at the end of an incorrect line, you will be prompted to classify the error and to add an optional, explanatory note.

Unsearchable, inaccessible audio\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of our Digital Excellence Program, the State Library has been focussed on the significant undertaking of digitising our world-class collections, aiming to not only preserve them but also provide greater access to broader audiences around the globe. To date the Library has digitised more than 10,000 hours of sound recordings from our collections but in order to make them truly accessible, searchable and valuable, each audio file also needs a corresponding transcript. Unfortunately human transcripts are a costly and time consuming undertaking, making it challenging for the Library to complete this mammoth task on our own. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecent advances in speech-to-text technologies have meant we’ve seen great progress in computer-generated transcripts, making it easier to produce transcripts for our wonderful sound collections.

You!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCorrecting our computer-generated transcripts is a community effort and you can help us to improve the quality of each transcript by correcting just a single line or every single line in an entire audio recording – every bit counts!
