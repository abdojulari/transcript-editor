Most of these, however, lack transcripts or basic metadata, leaving them invisible to search engines and inaccessible to prospective users. Recent advances in speech-to-text technologies have made great progress in opening audio to the web, but the transcripts they produce are still error-prone and require careful human editing to reach full accuracy. Transcripts are important because they make audio content searchable online, and accessible to people with hearing disabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe launched \u003ca href=\"http://togetherwelisten.nypl.org/\"\u003eTogether We Listen\u003c/a\u003e a project in partnership with \u003ca href=\"http://themoth.org/\"\u003eThe Moth\u003c/a\u003e, with generous support from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201551666/\"\u003eKnight Prototype Fund\u003c/a\u003e, to explore an approach to solving this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eThe Solution?
