# Open Audio Weekend  

Welcome! Thank you for participating in [Open Audio Weekend](http://togetherwelisten.nypl.org/openaudio). Below you'll find a selection of your 206 audio files (over 124 hours) and 206 computer-generated transcripts from our wonderful [event partners](http://togetherwelisten.nypl.org/openaudio/#organizers). This interface allows you browse and search partner audio and transcripts. You can also manually download any transcript through this interface.

NYPL and The Moth have their own versions of this interface for viewing transcripts. Visit the [NYPL version](transcribe.oralhistory.nypl.org) and [The Moth](storyscribe.themoth.org) version to browse their materials.

**Please note, this is not an active project. If you're interested in editing transcripts, please visit NYPL's [Transcript Editor](transcribe.oralhistory.nypl.org) or The Moth's [Story Scribe](storyscribe.themoth.org).**

Use of these materials is restricted to participants of Open Audio Weekend during that two day event. Please direct any questions to togetherwelisten@nypl.org.
