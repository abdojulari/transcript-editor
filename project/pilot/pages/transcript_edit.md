**Please note, this is not an active project. If you're interested in editing transcripts, please visit NYPL's [Transcript Editor](transcribe.oralhistory.nypl.org) or The Moth's [Story Scribe](storyscribe.themoth.org).**

<!--The following transcript was automatically generated using speech-to-text software, so there are probably errors. This tool will allow you to listen while you edit the transcript. For your convenience (we hope), the audio will automatically pause after each line.

Use the keyboard shortcuts or buttons in the toolbar below to navigate the transcript and audio. <span class="highlight">All your edits will be automatically saved</span> but may not be immediately visible by others. Once enough people agree on the text of a particular line, that line will be visible to all and no longer editable.

<% if (transcript.hasLinesInReview) { %>
The transcript contains lines that are "in review" (<span class="reviewing">highlighted in orange</span>) which means you cannot edit it, but can select the best transcription from a list of submitted edits.
<% } %>
<% if (transcript.hasLinesCompleted) { %>
The transcript <% if (transcript.hasLinesInReview) { %>also <% } %>contains lines that are "completed" (<span class="completed">highlighted in green</span>) which means they have been corrected by others and can no longer be edited, but you can still listen to them.
<% } %>
