1
00:00:03,65 --> 00:00:08,28
Yes you're saying the railway tech widens.
Yes. The only part that i had to deal

2
00:00:08,28 --> 00:00:15,10
with the railways was at that stage.
The deck widens because it's the as i

3
00:00:15,10 --> 00:00:20,09
said the arch foot wide and the brow about

4
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:26,38
a railway has to go out and past.
Whereas of course on the approach and

5
00:00:27,20 --> 00:00:30,87
just a standard distance
apart the tracks are just

6
00:00:30,87 --> 00:00:34,19
a standard but well i designed the

7
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:44,26
transition from the railway transition from
this the approaches on the south end to

8
00:00:44,26 --> 00:00:50,29
the main span i did that transition
that we have for now. But

9
00:00:51,21 --> 00:00:55,94
that's only part of the deal with the
railways across on the north side the same

10
00:00:55,94 --> 00:00:58,42
problem doesn't arise because
you go straight into

11
00:00:58,42 --> 00:01:05,02
a curve. And you are not there when they
were doing any of the original design so

12
00:01:05,02 --> 00:01:08,06
that you didn't have anything to do with
that but did you do anything with the

13
00:01:08,06 --> 00:01:10,83
preparation of any designs re the
whole bridge apart from that one.

14
00:01:18,21 --> 00:01:20,65
Now. Well. Can we.

15
00:01:29,19 --> 00:01:33,99
In those days when you were making
engineering calculations. What sort of quip

16
00:01:33,99 --> 00:01:36,58
meant to do you have did you have
calculating machines or did you do

17
00:01:36,58 --> 00:01:41,49
a slide rule of one which started off with
slide rules but that didn't last very

18
00:01:41,49 --> 00:01:47,96
long. Bought. Calculating
machines and these

19
00:01:48,78 --> 00:01:53,86
were hand operated you had to
turn a handle and also there was

20
00:01:53,86 --> 00:02:00,68
a carrier which you had to move along. As
you passed from units to tens to hundreds

21
00:02:00,68 --> 00:02:04,67
and so on. When you multiplied
because that was what is known as

22
00:02:04,67 --> 00:02:06,100
a com tom itor. No that's

23
00:02:07,00 --> 00:02:13,38
a trade name which they are ones. Where.

24
00:02:14,33 --> 00:02:17,85
I'm sorry i can't remember the names it'll
come back to be they were we had choose

25
00:02:17,85 --> 00:02:22,52
them after a couple of years
we got an electric type

26
00:02:22,53 --> 00:02:29,46
a couple of electric types ones which
automatically transferred the carrier but

27
00:02:29,46 --> 00:02:34,78
just still had to and you pressed a
button instead of landing and turning

28
00:02:34,78 --> 00:02:37,59
a handle. But those

29
00:02:42,37 --> 00:02:42,83
in red. There were

30
00:02:42,83 --> 00:02:47,29
a calculator. How do you didn't have to
do into their thing by slide rule or in

31
00:02:47,29 --> 00:02:50,84
your head or whatever they are if we got
those calculated we didn't slide rules we

32
00:02:50,84 --> 00:02:51,12
used

33
00:02:51,12 --> 00:02:58,05
a car. We had to forget how
many we had enough so that

34
00:02:59,62 --> 00:03:00,60
you didn't have to use

35
00:03:00,60 --> 00:03:07,11
a calculator all the time some calculation
i think you would still do by slide rule

36
00:03:07,11 --> 00:03:12,57
but minor ones where you didn't get. Extreme
accuracy and so on but i think mainly

37
00:03:13,55 --> 00:03:18,65
there were enough calculators. I don't
remember how many could have been more than

38
00:03:18,65 --> 00:03:21,67
three or four do you remember dr.

39
00:03:21,67 --> 00:03:26,28
Bradfield well did you come to know him
fairly well you know i only met him

40
00:03:26,28 --> 00:03:33,16
a few times actually in the course of the
work he very rarely came into the office

41
00:03:33,99 --> 00:03:40,24
and if we did it was mainly to talk to
gordon stuckey and just look around the

42
00:03:40,24 --> 00:03:45,67
office but he wouldn't say it very rarely
speak to any of us. So what was your

43
00:03:45,67 --> 00:03:52,28
impression of him. I can't
tell you i had no no

44
00:03:52,28 --> 00:03:57,26
particular impression of him. What about
your dealings with the doorman long

45
00:03:57,26 --> 00:04:03,99
started you haven't had anything to
do with him. No not really because

46
00:04:05,06 --> 00:04:11,32
gordon stuckey handled the
dealings himself. Mainly.

47
00:04:12,17 --> 00:04:18,58
Writing letters to i think to head office
in england both it would have been

48
00:04:18,58 --> 00:04:24,86
signed by bradfield or not but he would
have drafted this correspondence.

49
00:04:24,89 --> 00:04:31,74
We did have some contact with the local
officer. I believe in connection with

50
00:04:31,74 --> 00:04:38,44
some of the granite blocks in
the parlance where i think

51
00:04:39,59 --> 00:04:44,59
if i remember rightly. I checked some of
the courses to make certain that they

52
00:04:44,59 --> 00:04:48,81
fitted in. All right. And i member rightly
on one occasion i found that they didn't

53
00:04:48,81 --> 00:04:55,20
fit but i forget what happened about that.
I think gordon stuckey was probably away

54
00:04:55,20 --> 00:05:01,54
at the time and i think when he came back
i pointed out to him and i mean probably

55
00:05:02,33 --> 00:05:06,04
did something about all they may have
found out about themselves. But i by that

56
00:05:06,04 --> 00:05:11,83
time and had just it it somehow. There
wasn't very very important thing i'm sure

57
00:05:12,54 --> 00:05:15,92
but that was the only occasion that i
think i ever had anything to do with the

58
00:05:15,92 --> 00:05:22,63
local office and. Well can i take you back
into your personal experience where were

59
00:05:22,63 --> 00:05:28,98
you born. You know adelaide
and when on the 25th of may

60
00:05:28,98 --> 00:05:34,99
nineteen hundred and
one in my parents home

61
00:05:37,06 --> 00:05:43,90
where my sister and my last
surviving brother still live and

62
00:05:43,91 --> 00:05:50,09
did you go to school in adelaide and it.
Yes i went to first of all what was then

63
00:05:50,09 --> 00:05:53,82
called east at least
public school. Up until

64
00:05:58,28 --> 00:06:04,43
i was about aged i suppose.
ten or eleven. Then

65
00:06:05,57 --> 00:06:10,46
norwood district high school you member
your school days we are happy that

66
00:06:11,48 --> 00:06:18,37
reasonably some why there were
some happy times and some not so

67
00:06:20,62 --> 00:06:23,04
. But those were just

68
00:06:23,04 --> 00:06:29,99
a high school when i first
went there it was just

69
00:06:31,02 --> 00:06:36,89
in the same almost in the same buildings
as the primary school but they built

70
00:06:36,89 --> 00:06:43,50
a new one at mcgill i think
it would have been. Which was

71
00:06:43,50 --> 00:06:48,12
a good deal further away for me to travel
had to go by electric train that tram i

72
00:06:48,12 --> 00:06:55,06
mean the mcgill line and that would
have been when i did what they

73
00:06:55,06 --> 00:07:01,34
call their junior and senior public

74
00:07:01,35 --> 00:07:07,64
examinations. They were carrying they were

75
00:07:09,86 --> 00:07:16,14
slamming nations where external examinations
and their usually very big number of

76
00:07:16,14 --> 00:07:21,47
students went into held i think at the
exhibition building you know adelaide which

77
00:07:21,47 --> 00:07:21,61
is

78
00:07:21,61 --> 00:07:27,02
a north terrace. And we used to go in there
and sit for them. I think i passed very

79
00:07:27,02 --> 00:07:33,06
creditably in the junior one and i was i
think probably about the third or fourth

80
00:07:33,06 --> 00:07:38,71
in the states in the senior one was willing
to work towards mathematics in those

81
00:07:38,71 --> 00:07:45,54
days so many male matics.
After the senior exam.

82
00:07:46,46 --> 00:07:52,45
There was another examination called the
higher you could on your pass from the

83
00:07:52,45 --> 00:07:58,68
senior exam go to the university. But
there was no scholarship award and

84
00:07:59,57 --> 00:08:01,55
on the senior there was

85
00:08:01,55 --> 00:08:08,42
a scholarships to go to the university
awarded on the results of the higher. But

86
00:08:09,37 --> 00:08:13,96
for the higher the only school which had

87
00:08:13,96 --> 00:08:20,89
a class for the higher. Was the
adelaide high school. So i had

88
00:08:20,89 --> 00:08:25,65
to go to the adelaide high school for the
last year. There are ten scholarships

89
00:08:25,65 --> 00:08:32,32
given to the university and in the class

90
00:08:32,32 --> 00:08:38,79
there would be about thirty
students when i went there and most

91
00:08:39,72 --> 00:08:46,62
the ones where myself from all
the district high school. One or

92
00:08:46,62 --> 00:08:53,38
two from only i believe and some other
high schools. And those that came

93
00:08:53,38 --> 00:08:59,93
in that year i should mention that the
ones that were left there were probably

94
00:08:59,93 --> 00:09:01,04
those that failed to get

95
00:09:01,04 --> 00:09:05,93
a scholarship the previous year. They
were hoping to get it and they were very

96
00:09:05,93 --> 00:09:12,57
annoyed when out of the chain
scholarships sward in that year that i

97
00:09:12,57 --> 00:09:18,56
went to the ada high school there are six
i think least six of the ones that i've

98
00:09:18,56 --> 00:09:25,09
just come in. So the poor cows that have
been sitting there for about some of the

99
00:09:25,09 --> 00:09:26,73
couple of years. Try hoping to get

100
00:09:26,73 --> 00:09:33,68
a scholarship to the university missed
out. But of the others for i would

101
00:09:33,68 --> 00:09:39,42
probably say there were
three probably came from.

102
00:09:41,98 --> 00:09:45,70
Free of four probably about cho them i
think probably came for some people's

103
00:09:45,70 --> 00:09:52,41
college and probably one one or two from
sprint salford college. So one maybe and

104
00:09:52,41 --> 00:09:53,02
then there was

105
00:09:53,02 --> 00:09:57,86
a christian brothers college so i think.
There were about six from the end of

106
00:09:57,86 --> 00:10:04,45
a school i think i was about the fourth
in the fourth of the in the chance. And i

107
00:10:04,45 --> 00:10:09,99
think we had about six of the included that
gentleman the engineer i mentioned then

108
00:10:09,99 --> 00:10:16,26
strike stein and another
one was kids duncan. And i

109
00:10:17,88 --> 00:10:22,34
can't remember the others but some of the
others didn't do in generic they were

110
00:10:22,34 --> 00:10:28,98
doing. Probably. One
restrict probably doing

111
00:10:28,98 --> 00:10:32,67
medicine and i don't know what
else but there were certainly

112
00:10:34,93 --> 00:10:40,67
a lot out of our particular year which
was very annoying to those who'd

113
00:10:43,77 --> 00:10:49,34
had left behind and missed out. You know
your family was not pretty well off. You

114
00:10:49,34 --> 00:10:54,34
know where you could have gone to university
with them paying. Oh they might have

115
00:10:54,34 --> 00:10:56,59
but they much preferred for me to get

116
00:10:56,59 --> 00:11:01,49
a scholarship. My father at
that time the editor had

117
00:11:01,49 --> 00:11:06,10
a dad. But i say when i say it
it's perhaps i'm stretching it

118
00:11:06,10 --> 00:11:12,15
a little bit because slenderman eisen
called himself the editor but my father

119
00:11:14,09 --> 00:11:17,96
didn't say so himself. But we always used
to say that he did the work and selected

120
00:11:17,96 --> 00:11:24,37
for the kudos. Would be the
grandfather i think of kim

121
00:11:25,92 --> 00:11:30,16
who lost all your beautiful possessions
in the bushfire region to your read about

122
00:11:30,16 --> 00:11:36,87
it. But living to sound.
I think kim would be

123
00:11:36,87 --> 00:11:41,62
leaving some sun i think so. I'm not sure
about this but i think that would be the

124
00:11:41,62 --> 00:11:48,59
case. And your father was did he retires
as the editor there or did you do

125
00:11:48,59 --> 00:11:54,06
something. My father retired
about nineteen twenty. Or maybe

126
00:11:54,06 --> 00:11:58,32
a bit more might have been laid. Later
that night in thirty. That's gone to you

127
00:11:58,32 --> 00:12:03,54
your university years you went straight
from on to the university then and you go

128
00:12:03,54 --> 00:12:07,59
straight into engineering you went
straight onto the university and he went

129
00:12:07,59 --> 00:12:11,09
straight into engineering did you. That's.
Yes i said straight into engineering

130
00:12:11,09 --> 00:12:17,34
although i spent an extra year after
i finished the engineering course

131
00:12:18,10 --> 00:12:18,29
taking

132
00:12:18,30 --> 00:12:24,75
a science degree and that was in melbourne
or that was in adelaide you know adelaide

133
00:12:25,49 --> 00:12:30,93
adelaide. I know the words i had five
years at the university because of the

134
00:12:30,93 --> 00:12:31,91
engineering course was

135
00:12:31,91 --> 00:12:38,39
a four year course and i took an extra
year i had to pay if i remember rightly

136
00:12:38,39 --> 00:12:44,100
part of the extra the scholarship didn't
cover me i had to pay for i think for some

137
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,80
of the extra subjects i had
to take in the last year for

138
00:12:48,80 --> 00:12:52,45
a science degree. And
what was your first job

139
00:12:56,66 --> 00:12:56,66
.

140
00:13:04,13 --> 00:13:08,51
Well i think i didn't have a job for about
six or eight months and then there was

141
00:13:08,51 --> 00:13:14,78
a free passage to england.
Was advertised on

142
00:13:15,48 --> 00:13:22,07
certain british ships and i applied for
one of these free passages and about the

143
00:13:22,07 --> 00:13:29,01
end of nineteen twenty three. I received

144
00:13:29,01 --> 00:13:31,86
advice that i would have a
free passage to be granted

145
00:13:31,86 --> 00:13:38,67
a free passage through to england and
return on the blue funnel line and the

146
00:13:38,67 --> 00:13:40,12
ship. I went on was the n

147
00:13:40,12 --> 00:13:47,31
e s and i got to england about. About

148
00:13:47,32 --> 00:13:53,87
the middle of january. I think. 1924. What
was this. What sort of scheme was that

149
00:13:53,87 --> 00:13:58,90
the offertory passages on the ship you
were supposed to go and do some sort of

150
00:13:59,89 --> 00:14:06,50
study or job so shaded with your
profession that you chose and i

151
00:14:09,11 --> 00:14:15,89
i had incidentally some cousins of my
mother's in london. Who organised.

152
00:14:15,97 --> 00:14:19,15
Well this is the man.
The husband organised

153
00:14:20,39 --> 00:14:27,06
a job for me with the marine engineering
firm in or just out of newcastle in

154
00:14:27,06 --> 00:14:33,66
walls and on tyne. And i went there for
eighteen months doing mostly in the

155
00:14:33,66 --> 00:14:34,90
workshops for

156
00:14:34,90 --> 00:14:39,14
a couple of months in the drawing office
and was that was that marine engineering

157
00:14:39,14 --> 00:14:45,06
or general engineering. Marine engineering
they were building marine steam and

158
00:14:45,06 --> 00:14:50,68
diesel engines for ships and certainly
one of the only firms that had really

159
00:14:52,13 --> 00:14:58,41
good work on their boards in newcastle
at that time echoes there was

160
00:14:58,41 --> 00:15:03,59
a depression in the shipping
industry is that this was

161
00:15:03,59 --> 00:15:07,98
a north and north east didn't marine
engineering company the director was

162
00:15:07,98 --> 00:15:14,91
a troubled call summers hunter whom
i met not in their relation to

163
00:15:14,91 --> 00:15:19,25
this is john hunter. I don't
know. Well it was a bit of

164
00:15:19,25 --> 00:15:25,88
a gordon stuckey son also john summers
hunter. So don't hunter was to do with the

165
00:15:25,88 --> 00:15:31,22
consortium which was trying for the bridge
contract. And apparently he was somewhat

166
00:15:31,22 --> 00:15:38,10
irate that they were the to the didn't
get it. And he apparently he was. But oh

167
00:15:38,10 --> 00:15:43,28
incidently you asked me what my first job
was while i was at the university the

168
00:15:43,98 --> 00:15:50,59
adelaide observatory advertised for
students to assist with observations

169
00:15:50,59 --> 00:15:57,33
of stars which were being
carried out by the observatory

170
00:15:57,33 --> 00:15:59,53
in connection with

171
00:15:59,53 --> 00:16:06,47
a world wide. Program to
try and fix. The position

172
00:16:06,47 --> 00:16:11,93
of certain stars and this was being carried
out in connection with the program

173
00:16:11,94 --> 00:16:18,32
which was being done in england and
i think also in south africa. And

174
00:16:19,70 --> 00:16:23,37
i read. I'm not sure it
was one or two nights

175
00:16:23,37 --> 00:16:29,68
a week and i had to assist in taking these
operate mainly reading the telescope

176
00:16:29,68 --> 00:16:36,29
various. Results of the telescope.
After that than i used to take

177
00:16:37,34 --> 00:16:42,76
they employed us several other university
on calculations in connection with this

178
00:16:43,50 --> 00:16:49,98
and also we used to take. Star observations
for time purposes for us to check the

179
00:16:49,98 --> 00:16:53,28
time and i used to go down
there one or two nights

180
00:16:53,28 --> 00:16:59,22
a week to do this and this went
on after i left university.

181
00:16:59,95 --> 00:17:04,95
I still had a one on one or two hours

182
00:17:04,96 --> 00:17:09,06
a week on this which kept me in pocket
money while i was searching for

183
00:17:09,06 --> 00:17:15,58
a job. Yes. Look we're number
of university students

184
00:17:15,58 --> 00:17:22,21
that were also working there by the way.
And while you when you come back from

185
00:17:22,21 --> 00:17:26,76
england was it was for public works your
first term. Yes that's right. I didn't i

186
00:17:26,76 --> 00:17:28,24
was looking for again looking for

187
00:17:28,24 --> 00:17:34,81
a job for some time without any success in
adelaide and then i was went to for some

188
00:17:34,81 --> 00:17:36,05
reason i went talking to

189
00:17:36,05 --> 00:17:42,99
a professor chapman one day and he suggested
what i told you before you were never

190
00:17:42,99 --> 00:17:45,54
on the dole. I don't know where there was

191
00:17:45,54 --> 00:17:50,35
a doll. I certainly wasn't on the
dole. I don't think there was

192
00:17:50,35 --> 00:17:55,56
a dole nose days because during the depression
in the 30s i don't think anyone was

193
00:17:55,56 --> 00:18:02,42
on the dole people just read
brown well without any. I

194
00:18:02,43 --> 00:18:05,78
don't know what how they live. But i
don't think anyone got anything from the

195
00:18:05,78 --> 00:18:11,76
government and those days it may have
been but i don't think so yes well i was.

196
00:18:12,97 --> 00:18:19,28
Can you tell me about your subsequent
cria when you when you left the the

197
00:18:20,23 --> 00:18:24,77
department of main roads you went in the
air force then you came out again what

198
00:18:24,77 --> 00:18:31,76
bridges did you work on after that whether
when i you design bridges for most of

199
00:18:31,76 --> 00:18:36,55
the rest you talk about the air force.
Now before you went on the air force you

200
00:18:36,55 --> 00:18:41,37
were working for the department of main
roads again. And i went into the air force

201
00:18:41,37 --> 00:18:46,09
but i didn't didn't actually leave
the main roads they sort of granted.

202
00:18:48,31 --> 00:18:55,21
It's temporary leave of absence.
And my wife receives part of

203
00:18:55,21 --> 00:19:01,60
my salary from the main roads and therefore
the fact what happened was i received

204
00:19:01,60 --> 00:19:08,21
a certain salary from the
air force and it was

205
00:19:08,21 --> 00:19:14,25
lower than my salary with the main roads.
But the main roads made up or at least

206
00:19:14,25 --> 00:19:14,78
watch for

207
00:19:14,78 --> 00:19:21,68
a while. Main roads by dup the difference
which they page of my wife after

208
00:19:21,69 --> 00:19:22,36
i became

209
00:19:22,36 --> 00:19:28,89
a squadron leader. I think my
salary was as much as my main road

210
00:19:28,89 --> 00:19:34,44
salary and i. I think then used to pass
some of my money over to my wife because

211
00:19:34,44 --> 00:19:39,07
you no longer received from the main road
that i was i think the case. I can't

212
00:19:39,07 --> 00:19:45,02
remember exactly when you were in the
airforce when you first went in. What did you

213
00:19:45,02 --> 00:19:48,66
do in the airforce what was your job. Well
i was very surprised that they didn't

214
00:19:48,66 --> 00:19:54,76
put me onto engineering. But they put me
onto armament. And for eighteen months.

215
00:19:55,91 --> 00:19:57,61
I first of all did

216
00:19:57,61 --> 00:20:02,93
a course. On nor did an administration
of course first of all was about

217
00:20:02,93 --> 00:20:04,54
a fortnight i think and then i did

218
00:20:04,54 --> 00:20:10,78
a month or so of course on how much
point cook and then i went up to

219
00:20:13,35 --> 00:20:18,24
and i think there's no one bags. There's
no one bombing and i think it's no one

220
00:20:18,24 --> 00:20:21,89
bombing in school might have been number
two anyway it was the bombing and gun in

221
00:20:21,89 --> 00:20:28,22
school. That's evidence head in the north
of new south wales. And believe me that

222
00:20:28,22 --> 00:20:28,38
was

223
00:20:28,38 --> 00:20:35,58
a home from home. Because until the
nips came into the war and then became

224
00:20:35,58 --> 00:20:41,87
a little bit this happy but but that time
i was slightly slightly after that i was

225
00:20:41,87 --> 00:20:46,42
transferred to amberley
where i was. Acting as

226
00:20:46,42 --> 00:20:52,57
a cistern armament officer
for some months and became

227
00:20:52,57 --> 00:20:59,03
a officer when after
the first officer left

228
00:21:00,25 --> 00:21:05,62
but was transferred somewhere else and
then shortly afterwards i bet an engineer

229
00:21:05,62 --> 00:21:11,77
that i had known and they said what the
heck are you doing on. Robby. And i said

230
00:21:11,77 --> 00:21:15,81
well i don't know it's quite
interesting. He said we've got

231
00:21:15,81 --> 00:21:21,01
a job for you and headquarters. So you know
i knew i was transferred to engineering

232
00:21:21,01 --> 00:21:26,60
and air force headquarters and what sort
of engineering to do you do this mainly in

233
00:21:26,60 --> 00:21:33,24
connection with the design and. Of
australian ect it built aircraft

234
00:21:34,30 --> 00:21:41,10
and i worked under several
injured is but one

235
00:21:41,10 --> 00:21:47,61
race an adelaide chap. You had no
training in aircraft engineering did you.

236
00:21:48,11 --> 00:21:52,84
That's wrong. I did study
aircraft engineering as

237
00:21:52,85 --> 00:21:57,46
a sideline when i was went to the main
road just before i went to the main roads

238
00:21:58,16 --> 00:22:03,71
and i wrote a thesis on the design of
an aircraft which for which i received

239
00:22:03,71 --> 00:22:06,76
a master of engineering from had

240
00:22:06,76 --> 00:22:12,75
a university in one hundred thirty
five. I think. And i also taught

241
00:22:13,49 --> 00:22:20,16
aircraft design and aerodynamics at the
sydney technical college for about

242
00:22:20,16 --> 00:22:26,75
five or six years. Good just says you
know if you don't know. And so when you

243
00:22:26,75 --> 00:22:33,74
came in the air force. I was
going to say well after the

244
00:22:33,74 --> 00:22:40,73
more i gave away. All that
because i had too much work

245
00:22:40,73 --> 00:22:46,55
to do on bridge designs much too much to
keep going. So my knowledge of modern

246
00:22:48,26 --> 00:22:55,21
craft work. No mixers. Pretty
negligible. Which bridges. Did you

247
00:22:55,21 --> 00:23:01,55
work on after after the war in
which bridges. Dozens of them but

248
00:23:02,38 --> 00:23:07,45
the principal ones i suppose you could
say would have been the spit bridge. The

249
00:23:09,52 --> 00:23:16,47
bridge over the hunter river at hexham.
This was an opening band bridge and so was

250
00:23:16,47 --> 00:23:22,66
the spit ridge. And the
bridge over the hawkesbury

251
00:23:25,54 --> 00:23:32,38
. Piece very numerous other
steel bridges and concrete

252
00:23:32,38 --> 00:23:38,50
bridges known clearly. Steel bridge over
the clyde river at batemans bay and

253
00:23:39,41 --> 00:23:45,69
that was an opening span bridge
and one over the clarence river.

254
00:23:46,99 --> 00:23:53,58
At. Downstream from
grafton. I forget my spot.

255
00:23:53,93 --> 00:23:58,17
Because they're all by the board now
because the maritime services board now

256
00:23:58,17 --> 00:24:04,54
decided we had something years ago we
decided they didn't need opening spans and

257
00:24:04,54 --> 00:24:07,89
none of those bridges. So it's all

258
00:24:07,89 --> 00:24:13,19
a waste but the design of opening spanned
bridges it's quite fascinating. Really.

259
00:24:13,21 --> 00:24:13,69
That what

260
00:24:13,69 --> 00:24:19,02
a lot of work on that. And did you did you
do any work on the standard designs in

261
00:24:19,02 --> 00:24:25,30
those days. Did the department have standard
designs at that time we had standard

262
00:24:25,30 --> 00:24:31,85
designs for. Yes we had standard
designs for steel truss bridges for

263
00:24:33,49 --> 00:24:39,25
steel girder bridges and for
concrete good bridges and i had

264
00:24:39,25 --> 00:24:45,54
a lot to do with some of that work
too but after about 1950 or so

265
00:24:46,55 --> 00:24:48,70
or even before that although i did

266
00:24:48,70 --> 00:24:51,72
a lot of work on design and
i was put in charge of

267
00:24:51,72 --> 00:24:58,12
a lot of bridge design and my
actual work on the sign was mainly

268
00:24:58,12 --> 00:25:02,29
supervisory. That you get some credit for

269
00:25:02,29 --> 00:25:09,11
a change. Wouldn't you. Well i
had some extra work on the day

270
00:25:09,11 --> 00:25:10,11
through a bridge i did

271
00:25:10,11 --> 00:25:15,84
a little bit of checking on that that
was not our design that was designed by

272
00:25:15,85 --> 00:25:22,74
monsoor than partners
and we had the job of

273
00:25:22,74 --> 00:25:27,07
having a look at it. Making
certain it was alright. And i did

274
00:25:27,07 --> 00:25:32,36
a little bit of work on that
mainly checking up on the erection

275
00:25:34,45 --> 00:25:40,82
. Looking back at the building of the
harbour bridge and the way it was organised

276
00:25:44,35 --> 00:25:48,51
was that out of the ordinary you completely
out of the ordinary from your previous

277
00:25:48,51 --> 00:25:52,51
past experience you know was the harbour
bridge. What's your impressions of it and

278
00:25:52,52 --> 00:25:59,01
the way it was organized the design you
talk about the whole the way the whole the

279
00:25:59,01 --> 00:26:03,11
way that it was organized in the
sense that it had a design section

280
00:26:04,27 --> 00:26:09,07
a number of contracts who did the design
and you were supervising and checking and

281
00:26:09,07 --> 00:26:13,09
every everything was checked and double
checked. Is this is correct. Isn't it. Well

282
00:26:13,09 --> 00:26:19,62
. Since difficult questions you know initially
i didn't come on to until well after

283
00:26:19,62 --> 00:26:26,37
the tenders had been accepted
and i didn't yet have

284
00:26:26,37 --> 00:26:33,22
a copy of the report on tenders. From which
of which you probably see the copy i

285
00:26:33,22 --> 00:26:39,25
don't know what you have but that
was very interesting because

286
00:26:40,30 --> 00:26:45,88
i think mainly it was the work of gordon
stuckey and his chief of siders at that

287
00:26:45,88 --> 00:26:52,62
time. Would be holton's powers. And

288
00:26:52,62 --> 00:26:53,81
there they did

289
00:26:53,81 --> 00:27:00,10
a lot of calculations on the various
designs and many cases showed

290
00:27:01,10 --> 00:27:07,97
totally inadequate for the purpose
but for the. Site. One of them was

291
00:27:07,98 --> 00:27:14,11
by steinman. And. Steinman
subsequently got very

292
00:27:14,11 --> 00:27:19,91
peeved that they did his
design wasn't adopted. He made

293
00:27:19,91 --> 00:27:26,04
a sneering remark in his book.
Regarding the harbour bridge

294
00:27:27,16 --> 00:27:33,87
because the harbour bridge was. One
thousand six hundred fifty feet between

295
00:27:35,11 --> 00:27:41,89
the arch pins. Now the words
the steel pins which support

296
00:27:41,89 --> 00:27:46,50
the arch and the normally speaking you take
the spanners between the sense of those

297
00:27:46,50 --> 00:27:53,22
pins one thousand six hundred fifty feet.
Now the americans designed the bridge for

298
00:27:54,26 --> 00:27:59,54
the kill them. Carl crossing. And they
made its one thousand sixty six. Do you

299
00:27:59,54 --> 00:28:04,08
hundred and fifty two feet four inches or
something like that. I can't remember the

300
00:28:04,08 --> 00:28:08,70
stupid six something like that we're just
the idea of making it that much longer.

301
00:28:08,86 --> 00:28:15,09
So they could say they had the longest
bridge the world who designed that fridge. I

302
00:28:15,09 --> 00:28:20,35
don't know who designed it was and steinem
wasn't stein wasn't steinman no i don't

303
00:28:20,35 --> 00:28:25,97
think this time i know but but he slunk off
an hour bridge saying oh the australian

304
00:28:25,97 --> 00:28:29,57
people certainly people wanted to have the
longest arch bridge but they've slipped

305
00:28:29,57 --> 00:28:36,36
out reckons got well we've got to bear in
mind that our harbour bridge is designed

306
00:28:36,36 --> 00:28:42,56
for four lines of railways which are
very heavy load which. Never has had.

307
00:28:44,24 --> 00:28:46,73
And it's got

308
00:28:46,73 --> 00:28:51,94
a deck. It's i think one hundred thirty
two feet. Sorry i can't put that into

309
00:28:51,94 --> 00:28:55,74
meters but the kelvin cal
bridge is only designed for

310
00:28:55,74 --> 00:28:58,75
a relatively light road and it's

311
00:28:58,75 --> 00:29:04,84
a very much smaller bridge in size than
the harbour bridge. So i think we can say

312
00:29:04,84 --> 00:29:10,52
we got the greatest bridging if we
haven't got quite the longest one still

313
00:29:10,53 --> 00:29:16,02
a spirit i mean it's known to refer to
as the heaviest heaviest certainly is

314
00:29:16,02 --> 00:29:22,27
a lot heavier than they are that american
bridge but that's the bay bay on bridge

315
00:29:22,27 --> 00:29:25,95
over the kelvin colors. That's right. The
bay on bridge that's the name of it. I'd

316
00:29:25,95 --> 00:29:31,29
forgotten. I noticed that when you it's
something came to mind when you said that

317
00:29:31,29 --> 00:29:37,03
was bridge was designed for four lines of
railway yes. Now. Do you remember doing

318
00:29:37,03 --> 00:29:43,15
you all your testing. When they loaded it
up for with railway engines. Yes or yes

319
00:29:43,15 --> 00:29:49,98
we took we took stress measurements
on the arch during that loading and

320
00:29:49,99 --> 00:29:55,82
showed that the stresses were
quite within the allowable

321
00:29:58,06 --> 00:30:03,33
. According to the specification
and my mention that the

322
00:30:05,47 --> 00:30:12,46
locomotives which were used were
roughly speaking approximately. What

323
00:30:12,47 --> 00:30:14,04
was a been

324
00:30:14,05 --> 00:30:21,34
a maximum load you could have
expected from the railways

325
00:30:21,35 --> 00:30:23,16
. If they had ever used

326
00:30:24,34 --> 00:30:27,33
a way for what it was designed and what
the bridge was designed for was through

327
00:30:27,33 --> 00:30:33,30
very heavy locomotives. But the very heavy
carriage was behind it. Yes there was

328
00:30:33,30 --> 00:30:36,71
some argument about how many locomotive
because of course it's seventy two

329
00:30:36,71 --> 00:30:40,36
locomotives and tenders and then it says
that some of them didn't have tenders so

330
00:30:40,36 --> 00:30:45,62
they put extra locomotives on so i calculated
there was ninety six locomotives on

331
00:30:45,62 --> 00:30:49,98
you can't remember how many there were no
i think my calculations fair enough. It's

332
00:30:49,98 --> 00:30:53,94
just that people didn't read the whole of
the sentence. I just read the seventy six

333
00:30:53,94 --> 00:30:58,84
. Seventy six railway engines on it with
tenders and then they stop there. Whereas

334
00:30:58,84 --> 00:31:03,14
in actual fact the sentence 376 with
tenders. And then some didn't have tender so

335
00:31:03,14 --> 00:31:08,55
they added extra elway engines. So you
know it's ridiculous thing around there. I

336
00:31:08,55 --> 00:31:14,05
was had to scour around the place to get
some of those engines i believe it is true

337
00:31:14,05 --> 00:31:20,81
i came across a man who had
to provide them. There's

338
00:31:20,82 --> 00:31:25,75
a question re this loading of the of the
arch with railway engines. Is there

339
00:31:25,75 --> 00:31:31,38
a precedent for that. Where were any
other bridges tested in that way. Oh i

340
00:31:31,38 --> 00:31:37,21
understand that some bridges were but i
can't give you any detail that i don't know

341
00:31:37,21 --> 00:31:44,02
whether they actually loaded the final
and successful bridge over the the st.

342
00:31:44,02 --> 00:31:49,18
Lawrence river bank. Well i believe that
was loaded. You mean after the other two

343
00:31:49,18 --> 00:31:53,36
fell down. That's right. Well i think that
was probably the reason why they decided

344
00:31:53,36 --> 00:31:54,41
to have a put

345
00:31:54,41 --> 00:31:59,71
a test. I wouldn't be sure of that but
i think that is the case. There is

346
00:31:59,71 --> 00:32:02,42
a query here now i've done

347
00:32:02,42 --> 00:32:07,07
a lot of research and read up to bradfield
and i heard tell that there was

348
00:32:07,07 --> 00:32:14,06
a scientific experiment involved in this
which he was trying to to prove james

349
00:32:14,07 --> 00:32:20,72
clark maxwell's theory on which the
the arch bridge calculations are

350
00:32:20,72 --> 00:32:24,60
based in that in those experiments on the
bridge. Do you hear anything about this.

351
00:32:26,12 --> 00:32:30,58
I can't comment on that one phrase i don't
know anything about that you didn't hear

352
00:32:30,58 --> 00:32:30,95
anything about.
