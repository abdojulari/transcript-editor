1
00:00:14,65 --> 00:00:21,60
I suppose associated with that poverty
headspace is the concept that. Money is bad.

2
00:00:21,64 --> 00:00:23,78
Money is evil that.

3
00:00:23,80 --> 00:00:28,81
The whole idea of counting
and being aware of money.

4
00:00:29,42 --> 00:00:36,04
As i think is is an evil
process. And that then.

5
00:00:36,42 --> 00:00:41,38
Develops a desire to not know in our
whole poverty headspace because.

6
00:00:41,98 --> 00:00:48,90
It's in it's more moral to the poor or to
at least think your poor is more moral.

7
00:00:49,64 --> 00:00:54,31
Thing that strikes me about
that poverty headspace is

8
00:00:54,32 --> 00:00:58,43
that it misses a couple of
really important issues

9
00:00:58,44 --> 00:01:03,74
that are not of the poverty headspace
that have the money being evil and space.

10
00:01:05,34 --> 00:01:07,92
Money of course doesn't exist
anyway in the first place.

11
00:01:08,91 --> 00:01:12,24
It's a total figment of our imagination.

12
00:01:12,25 --> 00:01:18,62
Other than the paper that does exist
and the print that is sitting on it.

13
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:22,50
The. If we didn't know the language

14
00:01:22,50 --> 00:01:27,81
that it was written in if we were from
somewhere else it could be just as much as

15
00:01:27,81 --> 00:01:29,01
the classic of toilet paper.

16
00:01:30,35 --> 00:01:35,43
It doesn't actually have any value
in itself doesn't really exist.

17
00:01:35,88 --> 00:01:40,14
It's purely the figment of
our imagination in the value

18
00:01:40,14 --> 00:01:42,14
that our imagination puts on it.

19
00:01:42,20 --> 00:01:49,14
If all the money in the world was destroyed
at the moment the world would not the

20
00:01:50,19 --> 00:01:51,12
one bit.

21
00:01:51,14 --> 00:01:57,41
Poorer we would still have all of the cars
all of the houses all of the everything

22
00:01:57,41 --> 00:02:00,85
that we actually use we
would not. Lost one thing.

23
00:02:02,01 --> 00:02:07,59
But the whole place would be in total
confusion total mess total depression

24
00:02:08,36 --> 00:02:10,20
and everyone would be totally lost

25
00:02:10,20 --> 00:02:16,69
and unable because of one particular
magic somehow because of this weirdly

26
00:02:17,48 --> 00:02:24,29
figment of our imagination thing called
money people each morning billions of them

27
00:02:24,29 --> 00:02:29,81
actually get up and go and work long hours

28
00:02:31,17 --> 00:02:36,83
and try really hard in order to get these
pieces of paper because they trust

29
00:02:38,06 --> 00:02:40,72
that somehow having these pieces of paper.

30
00:02:40,74 --> 00:02:45,45
They trust that other people will give
them all the things that they want up to

31
00:02:45,45 --> 00:02:46,87
that level so

32
00:02:46,88 --> 00:02:53,86
that money in fact creates trust
amongst four billion people every

33
00:02:53,86 --> 00:03:00,13
morning of the day because of money for
billion people think they can trust each

34
00:03:00,13 --> 00:03:05,62
other to some degree at least a
little bit anything that creates

35
00:03:05,62 --> 00:03:20,46
that much trust can't be all bad.

36
00:03:20,47 --> 00:03:27,28
But. You know. Barter systems.

37
00:03:28,25 --> 00:03:31,06
Have the inherent problem
of having the thing

38
00:03:31,06 --> 00:03:35,22
that you actually want in the other
person's hand right at that time.

39
00:03:35,24 --> 00:03:37,82
The systems beyond

40
00:03:37,82 --> 00:03:42,31
that of the credit systems where you
are in fact transferring labor.

41
00:03:43,27 --> 00:03:49,05
From one person to another
basically require.

42
00:03:49,07 --> 00:03:51,33
Good solid computerization

43
00:03:52,87 --> 00:03:57,26
and an awareness of what work
is being done in the community.

44
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,75
You can have it working as a occurs in the
cities at the moment amongst tradesmen

45
00:04:06,75 --> 00:04:11,55
who are in fact hour working with
each other on other projects anyway.

46
00:04:11,78 --> 00:04:16,24
And so they're aware of the
quality level of the other people

47
00:04:16,24 --> 00:04:21,64
and they essentially getting
part of their spending.

48
00:04:22,02 --> 00:04:27,76
What they might be doing gardening landscaping
there getting part of their regular

49
00:04:27,76 --> 00:04:32,72
spending part dealt with simply by.
Labor barter from one to another.

50
00:04:34,36 --> 00:04:39,10
But that's really a fairly specialized in
those circles where they know each other

51
00:04:39,10 --> 00:04:39,36
already.

52
00:04:40,72 --> 00:04:47,19
The real challenge to get a community
working well in terms of a low

53
00:04:48,35 --> 00:04:54,07
employment a high unemployment valley getting
the actual unemployment level to drop

54
00:04:54,07 --> 00:04:55,65
for instance.

55
00:04:55,67 --> 00:04:57,25
The challenge with

56
00:04:57,25 --> 00:05:03,57
that is to actually take in the economics
of the whole valley to understand what is

57
00:05:03,57 --> 00:05:08,46
occurring economically throughout the
whole valley and to therefore have.

58
00:05:09,23 --> 00:05:12,11
A sense of understanding.

59
00:05:12,13 --> 00:05:18,00
Of a reality of what this
labor credit is really doing.

60
00:05:18,42 --> 00:05:22,67
In the. Every. In the work.

61
00:05:23,28 --> 00:05:27,43
Economics in the everyone
getting up every day and going

62
00:05:27,43 --> 00:05:31,17
and working economics.

63
00:05:31,18 --> 00:05:34,85
And so you actually build up a
visual picture of the whole valley

64
00:05:36,41 --> 00:05:40,11
and of what's occurring and of people
doing all these different works

65
00:05:40,11 --> 00:05:42,21
but you couldn't do it without a can.

66
00:05:42,43 --> 00:05:46,01
As a pretty complex computer level

67
00:05:46,99 --> 00:05:53,23
and you would therefore expect a fair
degree of telephone connection through

68
00:05:54,56 --> 00:05:59,95
to the to the various parts
of the community and to.

69
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,21
Actually satisfy constant
contact into the computer.

70
00:06:04,58 --> 00:06:08,84
To verify any any important transaction.

71
00:06:10,70 --> 00:06:15,16
That whole option.

72
00:06:17,09 --> 00:06:24,05
Is sort of has the comprehensive
complexity where a lot of people in

73
00:06:25,70 --> 00:06:31,26
the existing community would want to
keep talking and arguing about whether

74
00:06:31,26 --> 00:06:37,71
that was a good idea for 500 years
if they could the level of questions

75
00:06:37,71 --> 00:06:39,51
that would come out about whether

76
00:06:39,51 --> 00:06:43,81
that was definitely what the whole
community should do would run forever.

77
00:06:45,28 --> 00:06:47,68
The only way to actually test

78
00:06:47,68 --> 00:06:52,41
that out would be to do it
to floated as a test piece

79
00:06:53,25 --> 00:06:57,56
but getting enough people to agree
about that float it would mean

80
00:06:57,56 --> 00:07:03,02
that you would actually have
to you would have to see.

81
00:07:03,04 --> 00:07:05,06
A million dollars in materials

82
00:07:05,06 --> 00:07:11,72
and other labor go in to get it to
actually be tested in a worthwhile way.

83
00:07:11,74 --> 00:07:13,15
Because.

84
00:07:13,17 --> 00:07:17,75
In order to keep away
from that house problem

85
00:07:17,75 --> 00:07:21,85
and the low value of house problem.

86
00:07:21,92 --> 00:07:28,60
You would actually have to
have some form of currency.

87
00:07:29,35 --> 00:07:36,26
Not transaction currency. Swap
between that internal credit.

88
00:07:36,86 --> 00:07:38,28
And the dollar.

89
00:07:41,47 --> 00:07:42,13
If you didn't have

90
00:07:42,13 --> 00:07:48,86
that then people would believe
losing their freedom from poverty.

91
00:07:48,88 --> 00:07:53,69
They would be caught they would all
this work as they were doing would be

92
00:07:53,69 --> 00:07:59,79
non-transferable and just like the
house. That's only worth a half a.

93
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,09
Third of what it's really were they
would likewise with all their labor.

94
00:08:05,17 --> 00:08:09,69
Be caught in a situation where they
wouldn't be able to transfer the value

95
00:08:10,89 --> 00:08:15,65
and that's why at the moment you've
only got in those barter credit systems

96
00:08:15,65 --> 00:08:18,27
that are occurring. People
can only afford to do.

97
00:08:18,29 --> 00:08:23,28
Maybe a quarter a fifth of
their total labor in that way

98
00:08:24,26 --> 00:08:28,56
but in nim and with such a huge
employment unemployment problem.

99
00:08:29,22 --> 00:08:32,00
One quarter one fifth might be very good

100
00:08:32,00 --> 00:08:49,01
but that's not going to
solve the question here.

101
00:08:49,03 --> 00:08:54,69
The first the first problem
with getting those legal

102
00:08:55,44 --> 00:08:58,62
and in existence was.

103
00:09:00,47 --> 00:09:02,79
A requirement of the co-operative.

104
00:09:03,24 --> 00:09:09,68
Registrar that touraine the shire
council had to give its approval.

105
00:09:09,70 --> 00:09:15,36
To the development. They had
to give its approval to.

106
00:09:16,22 --> 00:09:22,91
A large number of houses being built on
this one property which technically up to

107
00:09:22,91 --> 00:09:27,32
that time would have only normally
been allowed in three or four houses.

108
00:09:29,30 --> 00:09:34,66
And the registrar of cooperatives was
saying that therefore it might be.

109
00:09:37,52 --> 00:09:40,29
Illegal or it might be a ruse.

110
00:09:41,04 --> 00:09:44,72
If a lot of people hundreds of people
bought shares in a co-operative

111
00:09:44,72 --> 00:09:49,38
that was only going to be allowed
three or four houses so.

112
00:09:50,01 --> 00:09:54,72
We had to go to drain
the shire council. And.

113
00:09:55,53 --> 00:09:59,95
Luckily we had wally ducker in
the health department doing.

114
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,99
Thing inspector who was very supportive
and friendly and helpful and.

115
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:11,17
I suppose it most likely helped in the
background economics of the whole place

116
00:10:11,17 --> 00:10:16,65
that the property had not yet been purchased
on our purchase would be dependent

117
00:10:16,65 --> 00:10:20,09
upon the approval being given.

118
00:10:20,11 --> 00:10:26,81
Also the particular property is. You
know a separate valley from the nimbin.

119
00:10:27,95 --> 00:10:29,60
Town and actual name and valley.

120
00:10:29,74 --> 00:10:36,63
So it had a privacy for the rest of
nimbin. Really out of sight out of mind.

121
00:10:37,87 --> 00:10:43,47
You know in a large part
and. So in the event.

122
00:10:44,01 --> 00:10:47,27
Yeah i put forward the submission

123
00:10:48,16 --> 00:10:50,85
and spoke a little bit

124
00:10:51,56 --> 00:10:58,30
and luckily this extremely conservative
rural national party country party at

125
00:10:58,30 --> 00:11:00,67
that time.

126
00:11:00,68 --> 00:11:07,00
The shire agreed to australia's largest
commu being established inside to own a

127
00:11:07,00 --> 00:11:12,40
show.

128
00:11:12,42 --> 00:11:18,43
Well it was initially about a
thousand and 40. Ton of all fours.

129
00:11:20,15 --> 00:11:21,92
Was a it was an issue about a thousand

130
00:11:21,92 --> 00:11:27,58
and forty if i remember akers
the original purchase price.

131
00:11:29,26 --> 00:11:36,20
Was raised by the owner in the process
of the seven months between the

132
00:11:36,20 --> 00:11:37,34
original agreement

133
00:11:38,28 --> 00:11:45,80
and the final signing of
transfer of contract documents.

134
00:11:45,82 --> 00:11:47,84
It was. I think it.

135
00:11:47,85 --> 00:11:53,72
I think it changed up to one hundred six
thousand dollars to been either just on a

136
00:11:53,72 --> 00:11:59,81
hundred thousand or just below
it and it got moved up. So as.

137
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,44
If thousand acres one hundred thousand
essentially 100 dollars an acre.

138
00:12:05,47 --> 00:12:11,58
For what was half forest maybe more
than half are arrested high ground.

139
00:12:12,53 --> 00:12:17,76
And. With the running down.

140
00:12:17,78 --> 00:12:22,28
To a creek going down the middle of the
creek was coming from tunnel falls

141
00:12:22,28 --> 00:12:26,85
waterfall which is a really spectacular
beautiful waterfall at the top of the

142
00:12:26,85 --> 00:12:31,44
valley and then ran for some kilometer

143
00:12:31,45 --> 00:12:35,63
and a half through the property. Later on.

144
00:12:36,91 --> 00:12:42,56
The other side of the valley
hasn't variously been bought.

145
00:12:42,58 --> 00:12:46,49
Part of it in a small multiple
occupancy separate from time

146
00:12:47,37 --> 00:12:52,02
and part of it by town about
itself. And has come up.

147
00:12:52,08 --> 00:12:54,46
I think the whole the whole valley.

148
00:12:54,48 --> 00:13:02,64
Would be around about
sixteen hundred acres.

149
00:13:05,06 --> 00:13:12,04
Six that's sixteen hundred acres if these
days it's hard to imagine what a beauty

150
00:13:12,04 --> 00:13:18,32
worth it had certainly be worth a
million dollars without the houses on.

151
00:13:18,83 --> 00:13:21,83
It would be worth over a million
dollars without the houses and.

152
00:13:22,26 --> 00:13:28,45
The question of how much value the
houses add depends on what the

153
00:13:29,24 --> 00:13:32,94
headspace of the people are
that are living in them

154
00:13:32,94 --> 00:13:39,71
and you know that's you could you
could go through any range of values.

155
00:13:40,53 --> 00:13:44,13
You could you could look at you could look
at a range of anything from one million

156
00:13:44,13 --> 00:13:48,21
to 10 million dollars. Depending on.

157
00:13:48,22 --> 00:13:59,50
Yeah how you look at it.

158
00:14:09,83 --> 00:14:16,42
I guess the reason why i did not stay a
ton of it sort of that that's not is

159
00:14:16,42 --> 00:14:20,44
that simple. They had to because
my level of friendships.

160
00:14:20,46 --> 00:14:25,34
A ton of all fours and such that.

161
00:14:25,35 --> 00:14:32,49
I i know never at any particular time
decided to not stay attainable for.

162
00:14:32,50 --> 00:14:36,37
Because i knew i could always go
back at any time that i wanted

163
00:14:37,76 --> 00:14:43,06
but i'd never actually built a house a
tunnel because i was too involved trying to

164
00:14:43,06 --> 00:14:49,89
get there is community projects going.
And so i had never had a house and.

165
00:14:52,48 --> 00:14:59,20
So when i got involved with the bush factory.
Starting the co-operative down here.

166
00:15:01,02 --> 00:15:06,28
And it was obviously going to
need a huge amount of effort.

167
00:15:06,29 --> 00:15:12,43
And just time and all the long bits
and pieces and also at that time.

168
00:15:12,72 --> 00:15:15,54
Because i was on lismore city council.

169
00:15:15,56 --> 00:15:19,76
And having a place down here
at the factory means that.

170
00:15:20,46 --> 00:15:24,32
I didn't have a slight hitch
because i didn't have a car.

171
00:15:24,34 --> 00:15:27,85
And i was hitching into council meetings.

172
00:15:27,86 --> 00:15:34,69
And so not having a starter hitch
was suddenly a very useful sort of

173
00:15:34,69 --> 00:15:43,12
easy step easy change.

174
00:15:43,14 --> 00:15:47,92
Well it was in 1976.

175
00:15:49,36 --> 00:15:55,26
That bob marsh who had been the
policeman during the aquarius festival.

176
00:15:55,28 --> 00:15:59,39
And had now been transferred by the
police department out to more real.

177
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,96
Some such place and had.

178
00:16:02,97 --> 00:16:07,51
Therefore decided that he had to
sell the old but a factory in them.

179
00:16:08,87 --> 00:16:14,14
And i was approached by basil
hayter asking whether i wanted to.

180
00:16:15,97 --> 00:16:19,21
Have it and.

181
00:16:19,23 --> 00:16:26,17
I'd been working on the
registration i was of i had in

182
00:16:26,17 --> 00:16:32,70
fact. Yes received their id
strain of. Bush co-operative.

183
00:16:32,72 --> 00:16:38,50
The aim of bush privateer seem to
concentrate on job work creation

184
00:16:39,82 --> 00:16:40,69
and.

185
00:16:42,21 --> 00:16:47,89
So we'd looked at a possible shop
up in the centre of town and

186
00:16:47,90 --> 00:16:50,29
that didn't work out at
that particular time

187
00:16:51,31 --> 00:16:55,21
and then suddenly this offer
came up and so i said.

188
00:16:55,80 --> 00:16:59,39
Well when i said to him straight away.

189
00:16:59,50 --> 00:17:03,27
Yeah that's great and i took it
along to a cooperative meeting and.

190
00:17:03,60 --> 00:17:06,09
The co-operative sort of said well

191
00:17:06,09 --> 00:17:09,24
that sounds great idea how
we're going to finance it.

192
00:17:09,34 --> 00:17:18,00
And we arranged marriage for the
whole the whole purchased house.

193
00:17:18,83 --> 00:17:26,67
And the development of the factory
has run in i suppose the.

194
00:17:26,69 --> 00:17:27,90
The first thing

195
00:17:27,90 --> 00:17:34,19
that was occurring here was
bush supplies which was a food

196
00:17:36,33 --> 00:17:41,05
a food cooperative business
that began a ton of bull force

197
00:17:42,05 --> 00:17:44,24
and had been part of the.

198
00:17:44,25 --> 00:17:45,41
Essential group

199
00:17:45,41 --> 00:17:50,23
that had become involved to
register to form bush co-operative

200
00:17:51,85 --> 00:17:57,03
and it was the first use in
the old cold cold rooms.

201
00:17:57,05 --> 00:18:03,75
Of the butter factory and for. Going on
from that in pretty quick close session.

202
00:18:04,49 --> 00:18:11,18
Was the bush the eta and the summer land
times. Bush design some land times.

203
00:18:11,80 --> 00:18:14,41
Was started by.

204
00:18:14,42 --> 00:18:15,52
Bob craven

205
00:18:15,52 --> 00:18:22,38
and patricia sayers who patricia
is now one of the key workers

206
00:18:22,38 --> 00:18:26,96
in the lismore echo and.

207
00:18:26,98 --> 00:18:33,55
They started the summer land times
with a couple of other people and.

208
00:18:34,36 --> 00:18:39,86
Worked it right through until finally
some around times close they started most

209
00:18:39,86 --> 00:18:41,40
likely sometime in 77 or 78

210
00:18:42,61 --> 00:18:48,28
and ran through to one hundred
eighty three any three shiny for.

211
00:18:49,23 --> 00:18:51,74
And then the theater and later the theater

212
00:18:51,74 --> 00:18:58,47
and gained a sort of cafe restaurant
with and their recording studio.

213
00:18:59,79 --> 00:19:02,41
And later.

214
00:19:02,85 --> 00:19:04,49
Art art studios

215
00:19:04,49 --> 00:19:09,88
and a candle workshop
photographic workshop

216
00:19:10,90 --> 00:19:17,82
and a range of other semi artistic semi.

217
00:19:19,27 --> 00:19:24,61
Of candles and beautiful but i
suppose it's more of just a normal.

218
00:19:24,63 --> 00:19:28,74
Production business.

219
00:19:28,76 --> 00:19:32,93
So.

220
00:19:32,95 --> 00:19:38,53
Well they they haven't really
stuck together in their come in.

221
00:19:38,53 --> 00:19:42,01
Certainly not as they
had begun. There was.

222
00:19:43,79 --> 00:19:50,41
The those businesses as were
most of them started under the

223
00:19:50,41 --> 00:19:56,53
umbrella of the bush co-operative.
But at a certain point of time.

224
00:19:56,54 --> 00:19:59,18
The bush-gore operative voted
itself out of existence.

225
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,23
I decided to ride up and it voted for
the factory to be turned into a strat

226
00:20:06,23 --> 00:20:13,20
or title. Instead of being owned by
a cooperative as a whole. And then.

227
00:20:13,22 --> 00:20:20,14
The individual groups were then given
first option on the particular spaces

228
00:20:20,14 --> 00:20:22,50
that they were using at that time.

229
00:20:22,78 --> 00:20:24,00
And most of them stayed

230
00:20:24,00 --> 00:20:31,96
and continued.

231
00:20:33,04 --> 00:20:38,24
Yes it was originally
company an out strategy.

232
00:20:38,25 --> 00:20:43,72
Bill on cleese was then chris was a.

233
00:20:45,08 --> 00:20:48,00
Oh it was an interesting. Was
an interesting development it.

234
00:20:48,40 --> 00:20:49,64
That's certainly been very successful

235
00:20:51,13 --> 00:20:58,02
and it started in i suppose it started

236
00:20:58,02 --> 00:21:02,05
essentially because i'd been looking at.

237
00:21:03,70 --> 00:21:07,30
The questions with the
co-operative at the bush factory

238
00:21:08,22 --> 00:21:13,42
and one of our options instead of going to
strata title had been to really develop

239
00:21:13,42 --> 00:21:15,03
a company title

240
00:21:16,50 --> 00:21:21,94
and because of various arguments
we ended up going straight up

241
00:21:21,94 --> 00:21:22,81
but in the process of

242
00:21:22,81 --> 00:21:28,98
that i'd really looked at the question of
company title which is a type of title

243
00:21:28,98 --> 00:21:35,52
that is very common in eastern
suburbs sydney of all the flats

244
00:21:35,52 --> 00:21:40,18
that were built before started try to existed
which was only in the sixties i think

245
00:21:40,91 --> 00:21:46,31
before that all of those flights had been
arranged legally under company title

246
00:21:47,79 --> 00:21:54,28
and i'd suddenly connected the
idea of the company title

247
00:21:54,28 --> 00:21:59,72
through into a multiple
occupancy and suggested.

248
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,58
Talk to about that with
tony pago and he felt that

249
00:22:06,49 --> 00:22:11,78
that did work and that was
it was a good combination.

250
00:22:13,07 --> 00:22:19,88
And so i then set about designing in the

251
00:22:19,88 --> 00:22:22,84
broad sense of the.

252
00:22:23,35 --> 00:22:27,77
Of the bill includes community looking
at that for the right piece of land

253
00:22:28,87 --> 00:22:29,97
and i suppose

254
00:22:29,97 --> 00:22:36,70
that piece of land was chosen
mainly because of a huge amount of

255
00:22:36,70 --> 00:22:38,62
individual privacy.

256
00:22:38,64 --> 00:22:42,22
That it gives to so many
you know over 100 houses

257
00:22:43,79 --> 00:22:49,05
but they've all got such a huge sense of
privacy with beautiful spectacular views

258
00:22:49,05 --> 00:22:52,72
especially of sunsets. And.

259
00:22:55,32 --> 00:22:57,26
It could do that on a property

260
00:22:57,26 --> 00:23:02,67
that was going to be a very very
little economic use for anyone else.

261
00:23:04,08 --> 00:23:08,62
It was land that would
basically be wasted as a farm.

262
00:23:10,15 --> 00:23:14,60
Because it was such a
rough property. That.

263
00:23:16,35 --> 00:23:23,26
Farming would be continually just a
huge hassle. I also felt that it.

264
00:23:23,33 --> 00:23:27,77
The property would continually have
a weed problem in terms of lantana

265
00:23:27,77 --> 00:23:31,65
and lots of noxious weeds. And.

266
00:23:31,67 --> 00:23:32,58
That because of

267
00:23:32,58 --> 00:23:39,35
that one of the best ways was to get it
off the sort of cattle land which didn't

268
00:23:39,35 --> 00:23:45,34
really cope with that. And get
it into a cluster village

269
00:23:46,23 --> 00:23:52,97
that would have 100 families
interested in. Beautifying.

270
00:23:52,99 --> 00:23:56,80
The different parts of the valley and i
think that's worked very well that i.

271
00:24:03,73 --> 00:24:04,76
Yes.

272
00:24:04,78 --> 00:24:23,54
Both.

273
00:24:24,96 --> 00:24:30,41
I see which mean yes.

274
00:24:31,42 --> 00:24:35,95
After some years villain then.

275
00:24:36,63 --> 00:24:43,13
Made arrangements with a small city council
to become a strata title after starting

276
00:24:43,13 --> 00:24:45,97
off as a community title.
Sorry as a company title.

277
00:24:47,22 --> 00:24:51,88
There was another option which
would become available now.

278
00:24:52,22 --> 00:24:56,56
But which at the time when they really
wanted to make the change was not a ballot

279
00:24:56,56 --> 00:25:01,34
or a new type of title
could community title.

280
00:25:01,36 --> 00:25:06,88
Which was basically a version of

281
00:25:06,88 --> 00:25:13,39
that company title. On
a multiple occupancy.

282
00:25:13,41 --> 00:25:19,45
But with a specific example
with a specific fixed

283
00:25:20,28 --> 00:25:24,91
arrangements there a company title
can be any number of arrangements of

284
00:25:25,88 --> 00:25:30,34
that whatever your lawyer chooses.
And likewise before it existed.

285
00:25:30,98 --> 00:25:36,96
Strata title strata title was one particular
company title which was then fixed by

286
00:25:36,96 --> 00:25:39,49
law as always having
this particular pattern.

287
00:25:39,84 --> 00:25:46,55
So therefore a solicitor could not just
change some small parts of it which created

288
00:25:46,55 --> 00:25:52,22
a confusion and likewise community
title is another of those except

289
00:25:52,22 --> 00:25:55,17
that it's designed for
out door areas without.

290
00:25:55,67 --> 00:26:01,03
Interconnecting buildings strata
title is for places. There's.

291
00:26:01,05 --> 00:26:04,16
Walls that are shared walls

292
00:26:05,32 --> 00:26:12,29
and such things so they didn't have community
title at the time and billing cliff.

293
00:26:13,20 --> 00:26:19,52
Chose to become part of the strata title
in the process of doing though most likely

294
00:26:19,52 --> 00:26:26,13
were. Affixing their relationship
to each other. More. Then.

295
00:26:26,71 --> 00:26:30,04
On a general commune.

296
00:26:30,44 --> 00:26:36,77
Multiple occupancy in this area because a
lot of the desire a lot of the desire to

297
00:26:36,77 --> 00:26:40,71
not address questions in
the early days of nimbin.

298
00:26:40,73 --> 00:26:44,86
Was a desire for greater freedom that

299
00:26:46,59 --> 00:26:50,84
when setting up town of all fours
we had the place paid for.

300
00:26:51,61 --> 00:26:55,70
Well there was a sort of one
natural wing which said ok.

301
00:26:55,84 --> 00:26:59,75
Well we've made enough decisions
to get the place paid for.

302
00:26:59,77 --> 00:27:02,53
We don't need to make
any more decisions now.

303
00:27:03,24 --> 00:27:05,27
Now we can just let the place be free

304
00:27:05,27 --> 00:27:09,13
and just let the place do whatever
it wants to namely let me be free

305
00:27:09,13 --> 00:27:15,96
and do whatever i want to. And i
promise not to hurt anyone else and.

306
00:27:16,67 --> 00:27:20,13
The reality is that when you have
that many people living together.

307
00:27:20,81 --> 00:27:23,53
You always had conflicts and
differences of opinion.

308
00:27:23,80 --> 00:27:26,39
No matter how much people
try not to hurt each other.

309
00:27:27,54 --> 00:27:33,54
Because people always look at the
things in their life eccentrically

310
00:27:34,86 --> 00:27:35,98
they can't. It's impossible.

311
00:27:36,32 --> 00:27:39,92
Whenever they open their eyes they look at
everything they go centre glee they only

312
00:27:39,92 --> 00:27:43,01
see the world from where
their eyes are at the time.

313
00:27:44,16 --> 00:27:49,63
And automatically whenever they look at
things occurring between their house

314
00:27:49,63 --> 00:27:51,35
and.

315
00:27:51,37 --> 00:27:56,39
The street the road they look at the
mega century so they have differences of

316
00:27:56,39 --> 00:27:59,72
opinion and arguments and that
sort of question comes back to.

317
00:28:00,85 --> 00:28:07,48
Do you try to suggest a structure
to minimize those differences of

318
00:28:07,48 --> 00:28:09,39
opinion and arguments.

319
00:28:09,41 --> 00:28:15,50
Just as you create a structure for traffic
on roads to try to minimize the number

320
00:28:15,50 --> 00:28:20,72
of car accidents. So.

321
00:28:22,23 --> 00:28:28,92
It's not mass individualism i think if you
look at history the point about history

322
00:28:28,92 --> 00:28:29,46
is that.

323
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:36,19
Every time you move from something like
nomadic society with carries around this

324
00:28:36,19 --> 00:28:40,83
district and then even if
you take those same people.

325
00:28:40,84 --> 00:28:46,14
And put them in an agrarian
society where the farms are fixed

326
00:28:46,14 --> 00:28:51,05
and where they can't just follow the
kangaroos across the whole valley

327
00:28:51,05 --> 00:28:52,63
and kill them wherever they want because

328
00:28:52,63 --> 00:28:55,97
when they go from one to the other
there on someone else's farm.

329
00:28:57,21 --> 00:28:59,04
Even if you look at it in that terms.

330
00:28:59,24 --> 00:29:05,95
It takes a different set of moral ethics
to live in an agrarian society than

331
00:29:06,71 --> 00:29:07,80
in an emetic society

332
00:29:08,74 --> 00:29:12,44
and it takes another set of moral
ethics to live in a mechanical

333
00:29:12,44 --> 00:29:17,52
or a post mechanical world.
The greater freedom.

334
00:29:17,58 --> 00:29:21,46
If you want to have absolute
freedom of anything of any action

335
00:29:21,46 --> 00:29:25,78
that you want to take it any time you need
to live by yourself in the need to live

336
00:29:25,78 --> 00:29:29,69
as no medically as you possibly can
as far away from other people.

337
00:29:31,18 --> 00:29:36,78
Because if you don't then there'll be
some differences of opinion at times.

338
00:29:36,79 --> 00:29:39,48
And that will restrict
your freedom in some way

339
00:29:41,07 --> 00:29:51,33
and.

340
00:29:51,35 --> 00:29:56,19
So. Do you.

341
00:29:57,37 --> 00:29:58,94
Fail you.

342
00:30:01,19 --> 00:30:08,16
The way that and him and he you know the
image of the community. Everyone sharing.

343
00:30:09,19 --> 00:30:14,20
So much everything.

344
00:30:15,42 --> 00:30:19,05
Is it's really strange to.

345
00:30:21,17 --> 00:30:27,43
Test that out in reality and where
they are what part of that sharing.

346
00:30:28,39 --> 00:30:33,59
Was as limited as into a small household.

347
00:30:34,77 --> 00:30:40,07
How much of that sharing like of
land. Was then limited by ok.

348
00:30:40,25 --> 00:30:43,32
But let's not make any rules so

349
00:30:43,33 --> 00:30:49,24
that the sharing is i will agree to share
as long as i can have as much as i want.

350
00:30:49,25 --> 00:30:51,27
You know i see that.

351
00:30:51,47 --> 00:30:52,64
This sharing

352
00:30:52,64 --> 00:30:58,37
and the question of how much sharing was
occurring in the early days is immediately

353
00:30:58,38 --> 00:31:03,84
intricately linked with the question
of freedom. Are you sharing something.

354
00:31:04,24 --> 00:31:05,90
If you can have as much as you want.

355
00:31:08,26 --> 00:31:12,88
Have it goes back to then the number
of people as the number of people have

356
00:31:12,88 --> 00:31:18,94
increased in the valley the the continual
lesson. It keeps keeps coming.

357
00:31:19,11 --> 00:31:23,40
That. We need to really share.

358
00:31:23,76 --> 00:31:27,66
Now no i mean really share this time we
need to really share where you can't have

359
00:31:27,66 --> 00:31:29,02
just anything that you.
