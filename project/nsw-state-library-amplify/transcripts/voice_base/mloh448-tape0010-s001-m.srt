1
00:00:02,09 --> 00:00:06,92
You know I have waited where you haven't sat right or first outside that guy.

2
00:00:06,94 --> 00:00:09,75
It's time to start I mean when you were growing up your kid you know had it

3
00:00:09,75 --> 00:00:19,85
when we did you first feel you were more fully in Marnie the witch with your child or your i was trying to stay

4
00:00:19,85 --> 00:00:26,62
or yeah it was very curious about chickens and all remember after the family about it

5
00:00:26,62 --> 00:00:33,98
when told by Mr Freeman everything that you say officers knew was a family next door that pretty girl

6
00:00:33,98 --> 00:00:45,27
or boy was there for those twelve and yellow one whether anyone or saw them on Diane there from reading.

7
00:00:45,31 --> 00:00:50,85
Playing around to say you know I watched you I was finished up for knowledge for the dawn upon light of the things

8
00:00:50,85 --> 00:00:52,29
when you night on the hour.

9
00:00:52,3 --> 00:00:52,94
Why the doors

10
00:00:52,94 --> 00:00:59,44
and sit in the last night here because what pressure night in the fact that he had like three pointers just so you know

11
00:00:59,44 --> 00:01:06,13
so you know what they're here and any ride I finished up. He finished and I knew the court system.

12
00:01:06,77 --> 00:01:18,5
Then or I was watching the I was more rigorous you know go in there and you know yes i wanted me to do the same thing.

13
00:01:18,5 --> 00:01:24,46
The younger girls say like an impossible thing from very high and I had meter on when mom

14
00:01:24,46 --> 00:01:34,34
and seventy explanation right there. All I was writing so I shut the bedroom which is very unusual for the family.

15
00:01:34,35 --> 00:01:41,78
They're very strict all that there are and I've seen that right. They all.

16
00:01:41,8 --> 00:01:51,01
And I went down and I told we have a recent poll that said marriage

17
00:01:51,01 --> 00:01:58,32
and I should also understand it says that there might mean doubt very careful or you had something to do with sex

18
00:01:58,32 --> 00:02:01,06
but there are many right.

19
00:02:02,74 --> 00:02:17,4
It was known through his life that some of the kids had gone there to play in the fall

20
00:02:18,00 --> 00:02:30,86
when they are not there for them while the price for that took me in something under six.

21
00:02:32,57 --> 00:02:56,53
You know the big four or for the stuff there and you know it just was just to the on you or I didn't really

22
00:02:56,53 --> 00:03:02,37
and it wasn't terribly in the fashion

23
00:03:02,37 --> 00:03:25,61
or in life before it got the thing was really going very well for a couple that was frowned upon such a notion to do.

24
00:03:27,48 --> 00:04:06,59
It sort of got me that it was all that there can be found. There. And where you had pictures of you there. Oh yeah.

25
00:04:12,52 --> 00:04:35,26
That was jumping. He was right here right.

26
00:04:35,95 --> 00:05:08,83
In that we got together again a little cubicle a bit just to take a look at the that's the first. No I didn't hear but.

27
00:05:10,71 --> 00:05:25,56
It was something you know what they're picked up for kept coming one more one up to hear your opinion on the piles of

28
00:05:25,6 --> 00:05:28,6
money something you say to the Lord.

29
00:05:29,96 --> 00:05:45,71
It was down in the final of the great joy ride when they picked me up

30
00:05:45,71 --> 00:06:01,39
and we finished up north of it just down into the fire marker because or it was a very face is red and it brought.

31
00:06:02,8 --> 00:06:31,46
If it's all right that in the lore of it live with my brother. He did not want to do it down my street.

32
00:06:32,31 --> 00:06:52,89
If you don't want one for you to condone this again if you are then young black next door here in the back yard used to

33
00:06:52,89 --> 00:07:03,15
get arrested by their owners. Yes I know that they're gone now.

34
00:07:03,23 --> 00:07:21,47
They all be devoutly scared or if they are seem like they're on the top there was a Sunday. That's right.

35
00:07:21,55 --> 00:07:45,18
Anyway I always say one longs something and you are not sitting up on the floor or on the floor dive the fun

36
00:07:45,18 --> 00:08:00,21
when the just one on the ground on life. There is a fortune life and laughter that just leave it there guys.

37
00:08:02,77 --> 00:08:12,3
Horses get sort of the depression for years. You see I am there for you.

38
00:08:12,3 --> 00:08:26,06
I want to live there for a while an operation right. I've had a doctor get a doctor.

39
00:08:31,05 --> 00:08:37,82
Actually there and why we're here and why each one of me to get a little bit on this

40
00:08:37,82 --> 00:08:43,33
or no I think you are starting to get to the offender.

41
00:08:43,35 --> 00:08:59,72
Here here and when there are some very good if you ask you to come here or any lie.

42
00:08:59,78 --> 00:09:18,18
I have with my future wife of forty anywhere and there you are with and all thought might be.

43
00:09:18,29 --> 00:09:37,45
They are yeah when or if that progression. This year I forgot what I hear hear about the X.

44
00:09:37,45 --> 00:09:45,85
Ray and a very fun ride and I had a talk here

45
00:09:45,85 --> 00:10:04,92
and there a lot of the vice like the rock group to do that sort of with your high. The girls. I am here anyway.

46
00:10:05,72 --> 00:10:17,97
And I mourn with the days of my letter that you did stay as a child of course horses just short of a voice that you

47
00:10:18,58 --> 00:10:33,78
hear that all are the force for the war that's why I didn't really know I was it was very I always have to have done it

48
00:10:37,35 --> 00:10:42,57
and you don't like it

49
00:10:43,7 --> 00:10:57,25
when I was a bear that I that was one of the good always doing the early on then they had the stuff to get a place of

50
00:10:57,97 --> 00:11:10,73
but that was very clear how it will come off into some us all things would be fine and I was really bad.

51
00:11:10,81 --> 00:11:17,11
Then something like that for a for like every month

52
00:11:17,48 --> 00:11:29,4
or more if this were the thirty's one that is if the very thought of them all

53
00:11:32,29 --> 00:11:54,32
and why it sounds we used to get together. I never worked like a real choice but then I wish to practice on a voyage.

54
00:11:54,88 --> 00:12:07,87
All right now see if you get right on the boat. That was just my own members.

55
00:12:08,36 --> 00:12:17,12
I thought this was another sort of one where it gets in there or it can go you know you

56
00:12:17,15 --> 00:12:23,02
and I sort of nine of them alive and we've got a camera here

57
00:12:24,01 --> 00:12:31,45
and it was sort of a little rough building their efforts to find a five gallon. One of them.

58
00:12:33,02 --> 00:12:45,98
With sex with a few of you. One time just how they normally do business here but no one was there.

59
00:12:46,08 --> 00:12:56,25
Everyone could just sort of coming coming here. You know that was for good was very cost very much.

60
00:12:56,46 --> 00:13:03,46
One and it was me and the other sort of summary.

61
00:13:03,6 --> 00:13:26,09
Right but never quite a side room it was the fountain out of all that sort of stuff that not going to war

62
00:13:26,09 --> 00:13:33,29
or a real bomb myself but know that you still get the there was a bit in the thirty's story a good toilet

63
00:13:33,29 --> 00:13:38,64
and just me and one or yeah there the yeah there in the west of the cliffs.

64
00:13:38,75 --> 00:13:42,27
Yeah and it still is or they gave us a look on the level house.

65
00:13:42,44 --> 00:13:47,24
Three weeks ago and it was still pretty guys hanging around outside so it's still going on there

66
00:13:47,24 --> 00:13:57,19
and it's various parties will crash the bows down and I've got a clip of the clip there but they're just a long way

67
00:13:57,19 --> 00:14:08,04
when you went out. They listened five. That's right. You said Right but. The way they get here.

68
00:14:08,12 --> 00:14:20,28
There was a fight for the one year that was actually very they were in the city.

69
00:14:20,33 --> 00:14:23,84
I mean they say that you know Frank straight down to the cathedral.

70
00:14:24,73 --> 00:14:31,59
They say that used to be true it is a really nice day in the city.

71
00:14:31,59 --> 00:14:42,44
If our minds what's wrong with the toilets of rock you want to die and if you say it

72
00:14:42,44 --> 00:14:52,86
and you realize it's coming up this way and I just saw it here here

73
00:14:52,86 --> 00:15:04,49
and there was one of them in their room right there that's going down down towards the bottom bizarre because the place

74
00:15:04,49 --> 00:15:09,08
you wonder what you're looking at here.

75
00:15:09,33 --> 00:15:16,71
Yes because the Archibald failed was that there was that was also our supposedly a bit in those times too.

76
00:15:16,73 --> 00:15:21,65
It wasn't yet every person you know if you get one here you see someone you know dear.

77
00:15:21,81 --> 00:15:34,65
And then your boss of the time you hear your soul starting something else that you want with which but here

78
00:15:34,65 --> 00:15:47,86
and then of course there was the Washburn which was it. Actually yeah yeah actually with the ashes here.

79
00:15:48,07 --> 00:15:56,54
Here they are she can't think how to help. Yet you can hear that they are there. The dog that's right.

80
00:15:56,56 --> 00:16:02,85
Yeah this is in the thirty's it's called the dog or when. With the rebuilder That's right.

81
00:16:03,73 --> 00:16:07,58
I can remember when it was rebuilt think of the dugout that was the fifty's or sixty's.

82
00:16:10,22 --> 00:16:18,86
Yet here they're living off of here. That's one thing file it was another one.

83
00:16:18,99 --> 00:16:33,7
I mean it's a big guy and I told you that you could go in there with that but after that. Every one of the guys there.

84
00:16:34,03 --> 00:16:42,19
I said if they're capable of what he was doing here.

85
00:16:42,52 --> 00:17:01,84
Then of course there was a way that if they stuck it or it wasn't really one of the voices here

86
00:17:01,84 --> 00:17:22,61
or the family farm which my are right that none of you were the one of your family that I would go for it because I

87
00:17:22,61 --> 00:17:34,93
would not. I just want to hear what it was now it is so much though.

88
00:17:34,93 --> 00:17:51,87
Certain that we thought that really hard was a comforting thing was a four year lighter on the rescue six.

89
00:17:51,98 --> 00:18:01,12
Generally this is something that when it goes on and you know one of the dead felt that he had to do it whatever.

90
00:18:01,48 --> 00:18:06,05
Was once the when it was you know deficit and there's fire.

91
00:18:06,06 --> 00:18:13,17
Then you go there anyway they're not pushing thirty no on I was just there or I do recall off

92
00:18:13,17 --> 00:18:17,18
or another of those the mine very own players.

93
00:18:17,3 --> 00:18:30,36
That's the effect if it's at the fact they're not there yet here you know they're our down to you know it.

94
00:18:30,48 --> 00:18:36,9
The essential did why they're here where you're wrong sore the news on the technology you know what I did.

95
00:18:37,09 --> 00:18:40,31
There was three take then yeah that's right.

96
00:18:40,46 --> 00:18:47,25
Yeah they should do and I am recovered told some of the building I really thought that a little

97
00:18:47,25 --> 00:19:01,94
but I can get by with a I think the said a lot of action. A lot of there was a lot of tried just people coming in here.

98
00:19:02,13 --> 00:19:12,11
I said that all of the talk show you how all bets are off and think that they're not yet here I sit here

99
00:19:12,11 --> 00:19:17,4
and I'm just like a few not a whole lot of take.

100
00:19:17,47 --> 00:19:28,04
Could get into doing that and everything checked in on some of them for me to ever get why sometimes avoid it

101
00:19:28,04 --> 00:19:33,6
but I'll get you in the mood for sitting down for the rest but not.

102
00:19:33,61 --> 00:19:42,91
The fact that or yeah right or yeah it was very hard for us to do

103
00:19:42,91 --> 00:19:54,98
or Sapphire it comes down to a lot of things then a guy might do that or you know go forward.

104
00:19:55,08 --> 00:20:14,34
Sarka give a few players there. Then you know if your room. Struck. Yeah yeah me sure that was the message.

105
00:20:14,37 --> 00:20:23,75
So it sort of got it here when I sat there with the it will annoy me

106
00:20:24,11 --> 00:20:28,9
or three you are going to start a war with itself alone.

107
00:20:30,25 --> 00:20:36,1
They sure are not going to have a real areas of darkness or it might be

108
00:20:36,1 --> 00:20:54,98
or have to have a white ghost of any stuff that has a disclaimer that Tommy of air force fit the bill for the good he

109
00:20:54,98 --> 00:21:04,66
with my habit of let them think it was guy that they brought in on there with a bouncy chair for Scotty

110
00:21:04,66 --> 00:21:12,68
and his wife some stuff here we have here done a few times. If there were that much.

111
00:21:12,7 --> 00:21:22,6
I'm a fan of yours of the prime of this whole life stuff always know you're used to doing that

112
00:21:22,6 --> 00:21:34,93
and that's where they end up because by the way very affectionate boys to think of it is very affectionate for much

113
00:21:34,93 --> 00:21:49,00
more than what yet whether it was a guy with you or whether he did not hear them say I am more than me

114
00:21:49,00 --> 00:22:00,35
and you're the sign and I went through the front door of Britney's World War two What's on there yet never right now.

115
00:22:01,48 --> 00:22:14,47
And I'm going to show up for another very five of you in a switch.

116
00:22:14,47 --> 00:22:24,12
It will not have the final the traditional way so that is a very very long way staff there was a while.

117
00:22:24,29 --> 00:22:40,35
And you never quite get the one that was there and all that they all sort of action here and kind of back.

118
00:22:40,44 --> 00:22:53,61
I reckon on the line by the way back in the right way for a rhyme.

119
00:22:53,74 --> 00:23:10,92
That's the thing and I found I had a little bit of the floor as if it was simony but not

120
00:23:10,92 --> 00:23:13,83
when I was up there thirty seven months.

121
00:23:13,92 --> 00:23:26,17
You know if the animal waited for what it was I get to die or so when one of them said

122
00:23:26,17 --> 00:23:32,84
or for the art of war by the way.

123
00:23:32,9 --> 00:23:44,3
Maggie and your young while if you get lost in one of the say the wire for the fall of one fall

124
00:23:44,3 --> 00:23:58,75
or was in a new war that was the fifth in the way to the front office the top of the or the hallway

125
00:23:58,75 --> 00:24:09,49
or there in that whatever. You mean I was out of the door the form of noise that will hit that yet.

126
00:24:09,82 --> 00:24:20,04
Anyway employees or the rest of the Irish. And it was only they were told over this picture of it.

127
00:24:20,18 --> 00:24:24,72
I never had that with you and I was on one of those

128
00:24:24,72 --> 00:24:30,27
and there it was in a khaki sized one that were in the distance here with us.

129
00:24:31,28 --> 00:24:48,62
And I got into you know one of these to where they actually have this thing as a minister that what you do

130
00:24:48,81 --> 00:24:59,4
and I think what you did was just a storm that a lot of the idea.

131
00:24:59,74 --> 00:25:10,83
Did was for them and I read what I was more a nationalist that it was throwing their family here

132
00:25:11,11 --> 00:25:17,5
and it's now a wave of war and then I get watching the stuff like that which they still read it is

133
00:25:18,67 --> 00:25:33,45
when I read about the guy that won it and it and my wife will I live for them if it was just a one way

134
00:25:34,1 --> 00:25:44,47
or some other war. So was it looks six with the wire and where were the five one gallon that picture.

135
00:25:47,86 --> 00:26:04,17
One of the first one comes with it or a fun place there and there was a banner that. Still there.

136
00:26:05,47 --> 00:26:27,1
What what did you want the end of that it was so somebody's got to get it to the home and get you there.

137
00:26:27,22 --> 00:26:37,61
Again just as much more try to stuff it.

138
00:26:38,2 --> 00:26:48,08
And you decide to for so long as you could say that there was never a choice or I don't want that

139
00:26:48,08 --> 00:27:09,28
and I'm going to sign it if I thought that that anyone that they got such a structure to show off a little you actually

140
00:27:09,28 --> 00:27:22,87
did that and did you say you are the guys in the unit or around the idea were a guy for the left of the law he was

141
00:27:22,87 --> 00:27:36,82
but he never made it never even went so if the city had a few more you know very anxious of their the fact that if they

142
00:27:36,82 --> 00:27:47,93
get a lot of money in the way they offset the ordering debate.

143
00:27:49,66 --> 00:28:01,34
By that I thank you for the betterment of the office and the Off we go.

144
00:28:02,17 --> 00:28:16,36
It's a competition they I when I was one of the teams in the second year they try

145
00:28:16,36 --> 00:28:39,78
and fight crime in the areas that I like and they're biased and sort of thought we were there and we had a thirty

146
00:28:39,96 --> 00:28:48,57
or forty somewhere that wherever you went shout.

147
00:28:51,38 --> 00:29:01,27
Some silly thing some of the pictures of around here then that for very very poor

148
00:29:01,36 --> 00:29:08,77
or if the you hear that I got six in we'll get over six.

149
00:29:09,11 --> 00:29:29,79
I would be guys down on the fact that it was generally accepted that the office that he's a child of your voice that

150
00:29:31,07 --> 00:29:54,05
guides me I want to use a way to get a lot of money. It was a guy's I'm just just done. Not to want to watch the show.

151
00:29:56,59 --> 00:30:05,02
He was shot seven forty one is so right. How do you do. I am not qualified to Roy.

152
00:30:05,46 --> 00:30:17,26
That was after the end of the darkroom. The big room and it was curious. They were there and you know went on.

153
00:30:17,7 --> 00:30:33,67
When we were on our human rights friends for a year ahead of the coaster going as I was we went to a very easy day.

154
00:30:36,68 --> 00:30:37,58
Of yet

155
00:30:37,58 --> 00:30:43,49
or are you know this is to last question just before I go given everything about the Turkish policy in the book Liverpool

156
00:30:43,49 --> 00:30:49,52
Street now given the job. Files of the before the election.

157
00:30:49,54 --> 00:30:56,22
The winning four year old was before the boy did not hear what was the other two things something we were interested in

158
00:30:56,22 --> 00:30:59,77
about. And he had money.

159
00:30:59,87 --> 00:31:11,32
Rather the more you know stuff to just get more money and it was for that including much money in coins of ninety nine.

160
00:31:12,43 --> 00:31:22,08
Nationally Let's run it for the money before someone putting dollars here. And yes he made his money.

161
00:31:22,54 --> 00:31:29,3
That's why you buy any more but if you are going to go out. Well yeah.

162
00:31:29,51 --> 00:31:36,43
And anyway I showered for a couple bucks on sending them to what you hear the white

163
00:31:36,43 --> 00:31:54,24
or the little if any of your you want to solve that day I mean that by a different voice here said I don't hear much of.

164
00:31:54,27 --> 00:32:01,11
Was there any I see today. I've got through then it must get on a.

165
00:32:02,65 --> 00:32:12,47
Then there was a very well known to the sun sign right there.

166
00:32:13,32 --> 00:32:21,95
Yeah just to put that one right guy

167
00:32:21,95 --> 00:32:47,29
when he wasn't that much against a lot of you ARE YOU WATCHING THE LOVE YOU say I that I can buy a style

168
00:32:47,29 --> 00:33:13,12
or still just five seconds left in the right guy for the oil right guy.

169
00:33:13,25 --> 00:33:25,31
So that's why I always try to write them all up on the fact that all this guy

170
00:33:25,31 --> 00:33:37,36
and you are right the way they did not this. I didn't or you are forced to yell at us here which read just done.

171
00:33:37,43 --> 00:34:04,06
And if not if this is the word good God would just say nice. So if you were lucky it was a. A long time back.

172
00:34:04,28 --> 00:34:27,73
What is left that they what goes back here a lot of rich from the one with here with the with a guy that dies want to

173
00:34:27,91 --> 00:34:33,61
marry. It was natural get to the heart of the system.

174
00:34:34,01 --> 00:34:49,04
My brother and so I just want to know what to ask three four to five there

175
00:34:50,61 --> 00:35:19,19
and then sort of the other side of the family are one of them did you want the sort of my initial one airing that I was

176
00:35:19,8 --> 00:35:39,45
invited to if Iran did what you did that it was OK it was would've done what a sort of white shark that what we had was

177
00:35:39,67 --> 00:35:53,36
what the game was really annoyed sort of the way they are more than almost anything that was nothing out there.

178
00:35:53,88 --> 00:35:58,5
What sort of stuff you know what was the who was a very driven minute it's that interest as to what sort of information

179
00:35:58,53 --> 00:36:01,46
people could get their own house from.

180
00:36:01,62 --> 00:36:11,54
They are one minor part of the three story or four or more border everything the North lost

181
00:36:11,54 --> 00:36:25,6
and therefore the difference here is that it might if you're a little bit of was that all of this

182
00:36:26,34 --> 00:36:31,37
or a bit of for a bit of me going to reach the feature for the nation the information here

183
00:36:32,7 --> 00:36:35,48
or on the over the movement report a year

184
00:36:35,52 --> 00:36:50,52
or so I gather that the various actually ships a lot of the run the guy that the previous done a lot of which surprised

185
00:36:53,31 --> 00:37:01,73
by a sex object that the lawyer for it was written for the story of their car buyer.

186
00:37:02,66 --> 00:37:12,28
Somebody which is an excuse to give that there's one why destroy a lot of it is that in a civil war a city that had to

187
00:37:12,62 --> 00:37:13,13
look stuff

188
00:37:13,13 --> 00:37:21,4
and see every well watch I use that so very little if you can put your hand if you can get get them I'm a sucker for

189
00:37:21,4 --> 00:37:21,67
tonight.

190
00:37:21,7 --> 00:37:34,99
Then why can't I get a good one there was nothing in the way that one of the first boy I didn't join into any guy where

191
00:37:34,99 --> 00:37:50,8
they were annoyed at him. OK but that was the more I think this is the part that a lot of trees.

192
00:37:50,84 --> 00:38:00,05
You know where they were mean you know if you know the reason why we like a lot of the way some of.

193
00:38:01,68 --> 00:38:13,16
You know you would mine a city my city is not like you. I'm here. It was because I said here.

194
00:38:13,34 --> 00:38:31,92
You guys son is scale based and I can't ever drive so that was here that was also I'm just worried.

195
00:38:32,26 --> 00:38:36,47
We will get more oil for oil.

196
00:38:36,47 --> 00:38:39,99
When I come back I want to the center store

197
00:38:39,99 --> 00:38:52,28
and get all the boys went for a walk now over here toward a world where so are all of us while he was educated.

198
00:38:52,67 --> 00:39:04,77
You know not it's got your common sense get your life even if you are either with that Mary box were in one form

199
00:39:04,77 --> 00:39:25,16
or there was more that there is not good for you possibly with these places with people with the scalpels with I have

200
00:39:25,16 --> 00:39:31,25
to ring the scales What are they saying they want to write a for just a social club Oh yeah it's just a meeting here.

201
00:39:31,48 --> 00:39:42,57
It was and I called so I'm so I really thought it was kind of good to hear you

202
00:39:42,57 --> 00:39:52,99
but I have no wife there I didn't go I didn't really do because of my Do they were few

203
00:39:52,99 --> 00:40:14,69
and force the camps that clubs really. When I was just down there wasn't a whole I travel across in the sixty's.

204
00:40:15,2 --> 00:40:21,75
One of those little streets running down from a client straight or a straight if there been a place where the old one.

205
00:40:24,41 --> 00:40:28,17
They say the jury. There was a lot of a right shoulder with a straight.

206
00:40:28,81 --> 00:40:35,78
This week this modifies obviously you can get your X. Ray or it will be a full size.

207
00:40:36,46 --> 00:40:53,4
That's when you hear something you hear like that. I want you. So when you hear.

208
00:40:54,25 --> 00:41:10,25
We heard that they were during the war and even there it's your wife your wife. Right. The wife. You.

209
00:41:11,48 --> 00:41:38,55
OK And you can see here. She's the kids go to the world that is which will go.

210
00:41:38,65 --> 00:41:57,17
So hard for us to get back there was really much of what they do if she wanted to do it.

211
00:41:57,21 --> 00:41:59,82
So we just died for always showing up.

212
00:42:02,43 --> 00:42:16,14
Out there with the SAT for them showing the verses of what actually insist on one gets fed up with corruption

213
00:42:16,18 --> 00:42:27,91
but the rest of the license rules for the not to get silence in the what is it an orphan boy.

214
00:42:31,78 --> 00:42:43,33
She was heartless or eventually Arianne disordered story line sort of day at work or saw something

215
00:42:43,6 --> 00:42:54,23
and then went back to the food or sat there. So you see something with so much.

216
00:42:55,49 --> 00:43:11,36
I was sort of a guy a little money in that I could never know what they're getting at in interest on such dogs
