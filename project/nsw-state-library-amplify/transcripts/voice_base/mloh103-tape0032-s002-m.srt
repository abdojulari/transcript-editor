1
00:00:16,26 --> 00:00:23,26
And we must take back the professional
nearing. From science because you think.

2
00:00:23,51 --> 00:00:26,13
Medical science is not
a healing profession.

3
00:00:26,30 --> 00:00:31,84
It's a profession which manages the
symptoms in the body and that's not healing

4
00:00:31,84 --> 00:00:37,13
and in fact they don't believe in healing
because they believe in the context of

5
00:00:37,13 --> 00:00:39,28
wounds healing for example but

6
00:00:39,28 --> 00:00:46,20
that there is a healing intelligence
within the body which can be assisted

7
00:00:46,21 --> 00:00:51,27
by natural medicines for totally
outside of the their science

8
00:00:51,27 --> 00:00:54,89
and their realm of
experience but they feel

9
00:00:54,89 --> 00:00:57,71
that because of the
orthodoxy of their training

10
00:00:57,71 --> 00:01:01,72
that they have the right to pass
judgment on the natural therapies.

11
00:01:03,02 --> 00:01:06,80
It's almost like they feel they have a god
given right it's like being a monarch

12
00:01:06,80 --> 00:01:09,47
you know you have a god given right
to rule because of your birth

13
00:01:09,47 --> 00:01:14,98
and your place in society and they
have no qualms about accepting

14
00:01:14,98 --> 00:01:19,37
that role and. I don't think.

15
00:01:19,39 --> 00:01:22,61
Well i don't know that from
my perspective they feel

16
00:01:24,61 --> 00:01:28,53
that they're doing the right thing
by society. They certainly.

17
00:01:29,36 --> 00:01:31,33
I suppose they have to justify the.

18
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:34,23
Sixty thousand dollars or
whatever really of the year

19
00:01:34,23 --> 00:01:37,10
but they earn by continuing to.

20
00:01:37,83 --> 00:01:42,89
Being a little dura crass and create
regulations and legislation etc..

21
00:01:44,25 --> 00:01:57,17
I mean what would we do without them.

22
00:01:59,22 --> 00:02:02,30
Why do i think that. Well.

23
00:02:04,88 --> 00:02:07,13
What people forget is that human
beings are part of nature

24
00:02:07,13 --> 00:02:11,56
that we have evolved on this
planet along with all the plants

25
00:02:11,56 --> 00:02:14,91
and all the animals and the atmosphere

26
00:02:14,91 --> 00:02:19,02
and the water the mineral together.

27
00:02:19,87 --> 00:02:23,76
And consequently we share
life. Like a system.

28
00:02:25,23 --> 00:02:31,96
And for something like four
million years human beings

29
00:02:31,96 --> 00:02:34,91
lived on this planet and

30
00:02:34,92 --> 00:02:40,73
when irish fire in accordance with
the natural cycles of the seasons

31
00:02:40,73 --> 00:02:46,47
and the things that grew so it has
developed us. We haven't developed it.

32
00:02:48,03 --> 00:02:50,37
And now we're totally cut off from that

33
00:02:50,37 --> 00:02:55,92
and we don't live within a natural cycle
we for example eat things all year round.

34
00:02:56,18 --> 00:02:59,75
That should only be eaten for a short
time of the year like tomatoes very

35
00:02:59,75 --> 00:03:03,45
irritating to the system and a lot
of people are allergic to them

36
00:03:04,20 --> 00:03:08,82
and yet we expect them to have them
on our table in the dead of winter.

37
00:03:08,83 --> 00:03:12,35
And often we're totally out of touch
with our bodies we get messages

38
00:03:12,35 --> 00:03:16,43
that we completely misinterpreted or
you know we don't know what to do

39
00:03:16,43 --> 00:03:18,68
when we get them don't know
how to heal ourselves.

40
00:03:22,21 --> 00:03:27,99
So we've broken away from nature and the
system which grew us and nourished us

41
00:03:27,99 --> 00:03:33,16
and is there to keep to bring
us back to a healthy state.

42
00:03:33,56 --> 00:03:37,58
We've lost lost it and.

43
00:03:37,60 --> 00:03:43,63
I mean even in the early parts of this
century there was a lot of knowledge of folk

44
00:03:43,63 --> 00:03:43,74
medicine.

45
00:03:44,13 --> 00:03:49,11
People couldn't afford to go to doctors a
lot of people knew how to heal themselves

46
00:03:49,11 --> 00:03:53,06
with foods and who was in
wrist and things like that

47
00:03:53,06 --> 00:03:59,29
that we have lost and that to me a big
part of natural therapies is the.

48
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,80
Education the re-education of people in
the traditional grass roots folk medicine

49
00:04:04,80 --> 00:04:08,67
which is very effective and useful

50
00:04:08,67 --> 00:04:13,09
and people need it.

51
00:04:18,06 --> 00:04:22,23
Nowadays people get ill and they want to
go somewhere in take a pill get a pill

52
00:04:22,23 --> 00:04:26,39
that will enable them to stay at work for
example they don't want to take five days

53
00:04:26,39 --> 00:04:31,84
off and wrist and maybe faster a couple
of days and just have vegetables

54
00:04:31,85 --> 00:04:33,30
and fruit and and.

55
00:04:33,86 --> 00:04:39,24
Retreating to themselves and think about
the stresses in their life direction

56
00:04:39,24 --> 00:04:41,27
and why they're getting
ill and things like that.

57
00:04:42,22 --> 00:04:45,91
They just want to ignore that totally
and take a pill and have it all go away

58
00:04:46,99 --> 00:04:50,20
and the medical profession has
encouraged them mightily in

59
00:04:50,21 --> 00:04:53,35
that response because that's
where the health dollar is.

60
00:04:53,80 --> 00:04:57,93
That's what it's all about to them.
They want that responsibility.

61
00:04:58,87 --> 00:05:02,08
They want people to come to them
for every little complaint.

62
00:05:04,05 --> 00:05:07,79
Although now the health system is getting
overwhelmed with people who have been

63
00:05:07,79 --> 00:05:08,94
conditioned to do exactly that.

64
00:05:09,03 --> 00:05:11,71
And now just the other
day i heard on the radio

65
00:05:11,71 --> 00:05:15,78
that they're wanting to encourage people
to think before they go to the doctor

66
00:05:15,78 --> 00:05:17,92
about whether their complaint
is really a trivial one

67
00:05:17,92 --> 00:05:21,60
and they might be able to take care of it
themselves because the systems getting

68
00:05:21,60 --> 00:05:32,96
overwhelmed.

69
00:05:33,85 --> 00:05:36,90
The spiritual side of healing well.

70
00:05:37,61 --> 00:05:42,33
In a sense there is no spiritual side of
healing because if you are a holistic

71
00:05:42,33 --> 00:05:47,44
practitioner there is no division
mind body and spirit are all one

72
00:05:47,44 --> 00:05:52,87
and into woven through
every cell of our being so

73
00:05:52,88 --> 00:05:58,69
that is a spiritual component
to your liver. And.

74
00:05:58,71 --> 00:06:02,29
There is a large balcony.
Don't your thoughts.

75
00:06:03,63 --> 00:06:05,71
So that people don't for example imagine

76
00:06:05,71 --> 00:06:11,64
that you can treat depression through
physical natural medicine but you can.

77
00:06:12,60 --> 00:06:15,73
Just the same as if you're treating physical
complaint you often have to go into

78
00:06:15,73 --> 00:06:17,33
the emotional aspects of them.

79
00:06:17,69 --> 00:06:19,73
So there really isn't any division and

80
00:06:22,41 --> 00:06:27,26
but we really stuck with the mind body
split which again is sort of developed in

81
00:06:27,26 --> 00:06:33,52
the last 300 years through cartesian
philosophy through being really locked into

82
00:06:33,52 --> 00:06:36,62
the physical that's the only
area we explored for 300 years

83
00:06:37,80 --> 00:06:42,21
and we only just this century starting
to explore the mind with our infant

84
00:06:42,21 --> 00:06:47,77
professions of psychiatry and psychology.

85
00:06:47,79 --> 00:06:52,76
And even people who are involved in natural
medicine don't really realize a lot of

86
00:06:52,76 --> 00:06:54,64
the time. I get clients

87
00:06:54,64 --> 00:06:58,36
that come to me who just want a pill to
fix their problems and it can go away

88
00:06:58,36 --> 00:06:59,97
and they can go back
to work and they think

89
00:06:59,97 --> 00:07:04,35
that they're practicing alternative medicine
by doing that but they don't realize.

90
00:07:06,20 --> 00:07:07,32
Really what holistic medicine.

91
00:07:07,89 --> 00:07:17,17
Means on a personal level.

92
00:07:18,01 --> 00:07:22,92
But. Getting back to spiritual healing.

93
00:07:22,94 --> 00:07:27,19
This it needs such a thing as spiritual
healing you know where people achieve

94
00:07:27,20 --> 00:07:33,74
healing through laying on of hands
through prayer. Through meditation.

95
00:07:35,45 --> 00:07:42,22
And really the type of healing has to
suit the person you can't force a person

96
00:07:42,22 --> 00:07:47,31
to take up a particular approach to healing
people have to do what they feel is

97
00:07:47,31 --> 00:07:49,94
right for them and.

98
00:07:53,17 --> 00:07:55,03
And of course they do.

99
00:07:55,05 --> 00:07:58,43
So that's why you know and the wonderful
thing really about australia is that.

100
00:07:59,11 --> 00:08:04,00
We have free. Much freedom of choice.
With what type of medicine we.

101
00:08:04,55 --> 00:08:06,27
Entail providing we can afford it.

102
00:08:06,49 --> 00:08:10,22
There's tremendous sort of financial
discrimination against natural therapies

103
00:08:10,22 --> 00:08:14,10
because people have to pay for
them out of their pocket.

104
00:08:14,14 --> 00:08:20,35
But the fact is that they do. I
mean they support. A growing.

105
00:08:20,37 --> 00:08:23,11
Natural therapies industry
out of their own pockets

106
00:08:23,11 --> 00:08:25,40
and it's now estimated to be worth.

107
00:08:25,60 --> 00:08:28,80
I don't know half a billion
dollars a year to australia.

108
00:08:28,94 --> 00:08:33,18
That was a figure that the australian
natural therapies association came up with

109
00:08:34,75 --> 00:08:38,91
and that includes not only consultations
but all the manufacturing side of it.

110
00:08:39,08 --> 00:08:42,72
For example health food stores.

111
00:08:42,74 --> 00:08:43,47
A huge

112
00:08:43,47 --> 00:08:50,15
and growing industry which is beginning
to have an impact on our economy.

113
00:08:50,92 --> 00:08:53,68
So i think that we must retain

114
00:08:53,69 --> 00:08:56,99
that choice we have to have all types
of healing available to people.

115
00:08:58,83 --> 00:09:04,54
From spiritual healing to natural meds
into orthodox scientific medicine

116
00:09:05,65 --> 00:09:08,12
and there's a place for all of them.

117
00:09:08,14 --> 00:09:13,03
And certainly because of my nursing
background i'm pretty familiar with what

118
00:09:13,03 --> 00:09:17,27
orthodox medicine can achieve and i
would never say we must not have it

119
00:09:18,06 --> 00:09:18,60
that it's place.

120
00:09:18,66 --> 00:09:24,40
Really it's dramatic medicine it's acute
medicine it's risk you emergency.

121
00:09:24,68 --> 00:09:27,46
It deals with things when
they've gotten so out of hand

122
00:09:27,46 --> 00:09:33,12
that the person is not capable or
anyone else capable of healing.

123
00:09:33,14 --> 00:09:35,59
And if it stuck to that
role that would be great

124
00:09:35,59 --> 00:09:39,28
but it's tries to step
into situations and.

125
00:09:39,30 --> 00:09:41,12
There are so many you know chronic

126
00:09:41,12 --> 00:09:45,33
and subacute complaints which are
amenable to healing but that people

127
00:09:45,33 --> 00:09:48,18
when they go to orthodox medicine and.

128
00:09:48,20 --> 00:09:52,32
Don't get healing they get management
which involves taking drugs.

129
00:09:53,27 --> 00:09:59,62
Maybe for the rest of your life.
And while they may sustain.

130
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,58
All life for some time.

131
00:10:01,85 --> 00:10:06,48
Whether they actually take years off your
life in the long term is open to question

132
00:10:06,48 --> 00:10:12,62
what the quality of your life
is. Is another matter and.

133
00:10:12,63 --> 00:10:16,76
It also takes a takes.
The prospect of healing.

134
00:10:17,07 --> 00:10:27,76
Away takes responsibility for the
individual for their health away.

135
00:10:27,78 --> 00:10:32,06
But the face of all kinds of medicine
is changing dramatically in australia

136
00:10:32,06 --> 00:10:41,72
and its very exciting.

137
00:10:43,23 --> 00:10:46,35
With mental illness.

138
00:10:46,36 --> 00:10:51,12
Probably the most interesting development
in that area would be authored sorry.

139
00:10:51,19 --> 00:10:55,86
Also molecular medicine which is
a branch of orthodox medicine

140
00:10:56,61 --> 00:10:59,51
but they only use.

141
00:11:01,87 --> 00:11:07,32
What i described as natural medicines
like gardens and minerals for example.

142
00:11:07,34 --> 00:11:11,27
And they rely they do rely on
science through there and.

143
00:11:13,67 --> 00:11:15,40
The signings research.

144
00:11:16,98 --> 00:11:17,15
Say

145
00:11:17,16 --> 00:11:21,29
that most of the things they practice been
backed up by research so that's another

146
00:11:21,29 --> 00:11:27,49
interesting development within
the ranks of orthodox medicine.

147
00:11:27,51 --> 00:11:30,39
And this far as natural
therapies are concerned

148
00:11:32,10 --> 00:11:34,37
and their their role in the
treatment of mental illness.

149
00:11:34,74 --> 00:11:39,87
I don't think a lot of natural therapies
treat. Serious mental illnesses.

150
00:11:40,05 --> 00:11:46,42
You know the sort of groups that
have psychotic manifestations.

151
00:11:47,15 --> 00:11:51,25
But certainly amongst the
the neurotic therapies.

152
00:11:51,96 --> 00:11:56,71
Sorry disorders is probably a fee.

153
00:11:57,55 --> 00:12:02,90
Representation of natural therapies and
by that i will. Includes things like.

154
00:12:02,92 --> 00:12:08,23
Psychology which is a natural
therapy. Rebirthing and.

155
00:12:09,64 --> 00:12:15,49
Various gushed out there pieces
about a man and mineral syrupy.

156
00:12:15,50 --> 00:12:19,27
A lot of people go to natural
therapist for stress.

157
00:12:19,29 --> 00:12:24,25
Sleeplessness anxieties things like that.

158
00:12:24,55 --> 00:12:26,95
So then we kind of mundane

159
00:12:26,95 --> 00:12:32,85
and day to day emotional disorders are
certainly approached by natural syrup is

160
00:12:32,85 --> 00:12:45,78
but the more serious ones on the whole no.

161
00:12:47,28 --> 00:12:49,82
Yes touch is really important
in the healing arts

162
00:12:49,82 --> 00:12:56,28
and a lot of people go to natural therapists
who do body work on a regular basis

163
00:12:56,28 --> 00:12:57,80
because.

164
00:12:57,82 --> 00:13:00,24
Often it's the only sort
of touching that they get

165
00:13:01,35 --> 00:13:04,63
and this this particular team has really
been taken up with in the nursing

166
00:13:04,63 --> 00:13:06,39
profession.

167
00:13:07,65 --> 00:13:12,24
For example say with older people in
nursing homes and the recognition

168
00:13:12,24 --> 00:13:18,33
that they are very deprived
of physical contact so

169
00:13:18,33 --> 00:13:22,19
that their you know increasingly within
nursing homes for example there are

170
00:13:22,19 --> 00:13:26,87
programs to incorporate massage.

171
00:13:26,89 --> 00:13:33,53
Reflexology. Aroma syrupy
things like that that include.

172
00:13:34,16 --> 00:13:40,00
That are based on touch.

173
00:13:40,95 --> 00:13:43,35
I guess a lot of that just goes
back to the sort of society

174
00:13:43,35 --> 00:13:46,31
that we live in where we
have a lot of conflict

175
00:13:46,32 --> 00:13:52,72
and confusion around the
body touch sexual issues so

176
00:13:52,72 --> 00:13:58,90
that the natural therapy certainly
plays an important role

177
00:13:59,74 --> 00:14:00,79
in. Providing that.

178
00:14:02,51 --> 00:14:06,14
And that's been a difficult thing for so
the massaged therapists for example who

179
00:14:06,14 --> 00:14:12,04
often get confused with. People
who provide sexual services.

180
00:14:14,33 --> 00:14:20,41
For some people in the you know
from the public perception.

181
00:14:21,58 --> 00:14:24,26
Massages a sexual event.

182
00:14:24,28 --> 00:14:31,33
And yet that's not what most body workers
see themselves as providing they.

183
00:14:32,11 --> 00:14:35,79
I guess the way i would look at it is
that there's a big difference between.

184
00:14:36,56 --> 00:14:37,93
Sensuality and touch

185
00:14:38,99 --> 00:14:42,29
and sexuality then there are
different sort of things going on.

186
00:14:44,38 --> 00:14:49,79
And and touch in itself can.
Through it. Sensuality through.

187
00:14:50,17 --> 00:14:54,36
And then if it transference of
energy. Through its counterfeiting.

188
00:14:55,56 --> 00:14:56,90
Can be extremely healing

189
00:14:57,84 --> 00:15:01,06
and that's a very different thing
from the sort of sexual release

190
00:15:01,06 --> 00:15:04,28
that one gets from certain other types of.

191
00:15:06,19 --> 00:15:08,10
People who provide physical services

192
00:15:09,54 --> 00:15:14,20
and we don't differentiate between those
words of things very easily we haven't

193
00:15:14,20 --> 00:15:17,98
talked about it within our culture and
massaged wasn't a part of our culture.

194
00:15:18,31 --> 00:15:20,40
Prior to a few decades ago

195
00:15:22,35 --> 00:15:28,16
and i think it's sort of part of our
the freeing up of the whole body thing

196
00:15:28,16 --> 00:15:31,83
basically in our society which
i think is very important

197
00:15:31,83 --> 00:15:37,73
and it's going through all
kinds of phases in its

198
00:15:37,73 --> 00:15:44,78
and manifestations some
of them quite horrible.

199
00:15:48,91 --> 00:15:51,23
But it's you know i think they
said it's really necessary

200
00:15:51,23 --> 00:15:54,50
that we free up a lot of
our attitudes to the body.

201
00:15:54,55 --> 00:15:57,69
They've been making us ill
on all sorts of levels.

202
00:16:11,15 --> 00:16:15,89
Well sexuality is something we
can't separate out you know.

203
00:16:16,76 --> 00:16:21,50
We have i mean we've been repressed
that it's been tabu for a long time

204
00:16:21,50 --> 00:16:27,64
and now it's emerging as a very sensual
part of our being in something

205
00:16:27,64 --> 00:16:31,04
that we need to explore and heal.

206
00:16:36,78 --> 00:16:38,92
And you know. As i said it's just.

207
00:16:39,50 --> 00:16:43,28
I think it's at the necessary part of the
whole kind of taking responsibility for

208
00:16:43,28 --> 00:16:44,98
one's healing thing

209
00:16:44,99 --> 00:16:49,89
and for example sexual issues are
responsible for a lot of marriage breaks

210
00:16:49,89 --> 00:16:50,54
that break up.

211
00:16:52,67 --> 00:16:56,51
Because people go into sexual
relationships with so little knowledge.

212
00:16:56,53 --> 00:16:57,67
Especially when you're young.

213
00:16:57,70 --> 00:17:03,55
So little experience and they
can be devastating if people

214
00:17:03,55 --> 00:17:08,70
and we don't do enough teaching of those
sorts of things in you know for young

215
00:17:08,70 --> 00:17:12,17
people and all of

216
00:17:12,17 --> 00:17:17,90
that those issues are really fraught
because they become bound up with moral.

217
00:17:17,92 --> 00:17:20,11
Interpretations of reality

218
00:17:21,60 --> 00:17:26,86
and we don't have a simple
straightforward comfort of all

219
00:17:29,45 --> 00:17:42,03
experience with our
bodies a lot of the time.

220
00:17:42,04 --> 00:17:46,05
In terms of.

221
00:17:46,07 --> 00:17:50,68
In terms of workshops just
relating to sexuality.

222
00:17:51,65 --> 00:17:52,14
There's some of

223
00:17:52,14 --> 00:17:58,25
that sort of healing work going on
in this area there in men's groups

224
00:17:58,25 --> 00:18:04,01
and workshops happening. Within
the context of rebirthing.

225
00:18:04,52 --> 00:18:09,25
For example as a therapy sexual issues
often come up for people with all of those

226
00:18:10,37 --> 00:18:12,22
kind of psychological therapies they get

227
00:18:12,22 --> 00:18:15,77
that they're part of the issues they're
really fundamental to a lot of people's

228
00:18:15,77 --> 00:18:18,57
problems and so they come up

229
00:18:18,57 --> 00:18:22,40
and yes they're workshops you see
advertised around from challenge a time on

230
00:18:22,40 --> 00:18:24,20
sexuality and relationships.

231
00:18:24,55 --> 00:18:31,18
It's not my particular area so i
don't know a lot about how those

232
00:18:31,18 --> 00:18:32,25
workshops around

233
00:18:33,51 --> 00:18:37,45
but see if they do occur whether it's more
in this area than in the big cities i

234
00:18:37,45 --> 00:18:47,53
don't know maybe not.

235
00:18:50,13 --> 00:18:56,36
Yes. I think it.

236
00:18:56,38 --> 00:19:01,51
I think you know military action and.

237
00:19:01,53 --> 00:19:07,75
Well certainly kind of dropping out
of society is very confronting and.

238
00:19:07,77 --> 00:19:14,60
There is a lot of inner growth and
personal exploration goes on up here.

239
00:19:14,99 --> 00:19:19,03
I mean amongst the people
that i know there.

240
00:19:19,04 --> 00:19:22,56
It's just sort of second nature to
be talking about our inner lives

241
00:19:22,56 --> 00:19:29,03
and the challenges that
confront us on that level and.

242
00:19:29,05 --> 00:19:30,37
I don't know how much

243
00:19:30,37 --> 00:19:34,54
that goes on in wider society i know it's
certainly increasing i mean you can pick

244
00:19:34,54 --> 00:19:39,52
up all sorts of magazines and things
like that and find articles that reflect

245
00:19:39,52 --> 00:19:42,58
that interest. The
personal growth movement.

246
00:19:42,60 --> 00:19:48,28
And that's a very important component
for example of marriage guidance.

247
00:19:48,29 --> 00:19:52,17
Associations.

248
00:19:52,18 --> 00:19:56,92
And certainly it's a really
important aspect of leisure.

249
00:19:56,93 --> 00:19:59,88
I think that when people it's
like meddlers hierarchy even.

250
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,92
He's once people's basic needs are
met for food shelter security on a

251
00:20:06,92 --> 00:20:11,66
more physical level then we become free
to explore other issues you can't explore

252
00:20:11,66 --> 00:20:12,73
your personal growth.

253
00:20:13,05 --> 00:20:19,67
Really when years starving somali
it's not an issue but up here.

254
00:20:19,69 --> 00:20:21,23
Where people have more time

255
00:20:22,97 --> 00:20:28,58
and certainly i think now with
so many people unemployed.

256
00:20:28,60 --> 00:20:34,72
And so many people. Facing
issues such as stress.

257
00:20:34,74 --> 00:20:38,49
There was a story on the radio the other
day about how many more meaning going

258
00:20:38,49 --> 00:20:44,69
along to counsellors about stresses in their
lives particularly with the recession

259
00:20:45,47 --> 00:20:47,11
and loss of income and things like that.

260
00:20:49,10 --> 00:20:52,75
And so certainly people are turning inward

261
00:20:53,45 --> 00:20:57,54
and looking at themselves in the
way they react to life situations

262
00:20:57,54 --> 00:21:00,54
and not simply reacting and acting out

263
00:21:01,49 --> 00:21:05,35
and being out of touch with what they're
doing they're actually thinking about the

264
00:21:05,35 --> 00:21:06,11
way they react to things

265
00:21:06,11 --> 00:21:10,05
and questioning themselves about
well can i react differently.

266
00:21:10,07 --> 00:21:13,70
I cannot look at this situation
in a more positive light.

267
00:21:13,92 --> 00:21:16,62
You know do i have to feel
overwhelmed out of it.

268
00:21:16,66 --> 00:21:20,48
What can i do to turn this
into a creative situation that

269
00:21:20,48 --> 00:21:27,12
that kind of thinking does
happen a lot out here. And.

270
00:21:27,14 --> 00:21:34,62
There's a lot of innovative small
businesses for example in this area.

271
00:21:34,64 --> 00:21:36,05
And that's being encouraged you know.

272
00:21:37,45 --> 00:21:42,96
With government money desperate time.

273
00:21:42,98 --> 00:21:43,82
Yes so i think

274
00:21:43,82 --> 00:21:50,75
that the whole pretty personal growth
in the movement is to the forefront

275
00:21:50,75 --> 00:21:57,53
here but certainly also growing
in wider society. Thank you.

276
00:22:02,01 --> 00:22:05,53
Yes.

277
00:22:06,95 --> 00:22:15,12
It.

278
00:22:19,15 --> 00:22:24,29
Was.

279
00:22:26,65 --> 00:22:32,86
Well around nimbin this been quite a
strong tradition over the last 20 years of

280
00:22:32,86 --> 00:22:35,43
natural birth and home birth and

281
00:22:35,43 --> 00:22:42,22
that was initiated by mothers themselves
who could not get anybody to attend their

282
00:22:42,22 --> 00:22:46,76
birth at home. And so a
group of women who believe

283
00:22:46,76 --> 00:22:51,19
that they should have the right
to a natural birth known

284
00:22:51,20 --> 00:22:55,78
and not have unnecessary intervention
saw that the only way they could do

285
00:22:55,78 --> 00:22:59,46
that was to train themselves
and provide themselves with

286
00:22:59,46 --> 00:23:03,58
that service which they did and
most of those lay midwives.

287
00:23:04,89 --> 00:23:08,51
Competent and well-trained and responsible

288
00:23:09,48 --> 00:23:15,06
and have very good statistics in their
care of mothers able to pick up

289
00:23:15,06 --> 00:23:19,10
when there's a problem and transfer
they have a higher transfer rate.

290
00:23:19,12 --> 00:23:21,69
Then qualified midwives.

291
00:23:22,13 --> 00:23:26,89
In other words they tend
to transfer sooner.

292
00:23:27,92 --> 00:23:34,06
But yes they've just been deemed
to be illegal in new south wales.

293
00:23:34,08 --> 00:23:36,07
And that's very threatening for birth

294
00:23:36,07 --> 00:23:41,00
and beyond in nimbin because they have
largely been an organisation which has

295
00:23:41,96 --> 00:23:45,49
depended upon a midwives

296
00:23:45,49 --> 00:23:50,51
and birth assistants to
provide care and support.

297
00:23:51,78 --> 00:23:58,12
And without them to think beyond
itself may be in jeopardy.

298
00:23:58,14 --> 00:23:59,83
And it is in australia.

299
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,76
One of the few examples of successful
community development in health as an asset

300
00:24:06,76 --> 00:24:08,55
as a as an organisation.

301
00:24:09,28 --> 00:24:14,56
It is the an ideal in terms of what the
world health organization wishes to promote

302
00:24:15,33 --> 00:24:16,96
right around the world.

303
00:24:18,37 --> 00:24:20,43
With as what they call primary health care

304
00:24:20,43 --> 00:24:24,38
and putting health care into the
hands of the community the earth

305
00:24:24,38 --> 00:24:26,40
and beyond have been doing that 14 years

306
00:24:27,37 --> 00:24:31,09
and now that's under threat because of the
nurses registration board in new south

307
00:24:31,09 --> 00:24:37,94
wales. Who basically had from out
of this is an issue of safety.

308
00:24:37,95 --> 00:24:39,71
And yet that can't be proven

309
00:24:40,95 --> 00:24:45,33
and the opposite has been shown.

310
00:24:45,35 --> 00:24:48,64
There has been the odd lay midwives
who've done way out things

311
00:24:49,73 --> 00:24:55,99
and have jeopardized the issue of lay
midwifery for other more numerous

312
00:24:55,99 --> 00:25:01,51
and more responsible people but
the nurses. Registration board.

313
00:25:01,74 --> 00:25:05,62
I'm not sure if i've got the right
name as it association there but.

314
00:25:05,64 --> 00:25:12,43
Anyway the professional associations of
nurses have totally overlooked for example

315
00:25:12,43 --> 00:25:16,86
the right of women to choose a health
care practitioner who is not an official

316
00:25:16,86 --> 00:25:22,16
health care practitioners they've
totally overlooked the world health

317
00:25:22,16 --> 00:25:24,47
organization's.

318
00:25:26,47 --> 00:25:31,97
Philosophy with regard to traditional
medicine and lay midwifery.

319
00:25:31,99 --> 00:25:38,18
If these women who are practicing
lay midwifery existed in africa

320
00:25:38,18 --> 00:25:44,15
or india they would be lauded for their
activities they would be assisted with

321
00:25:44,15 --> 00:25:46,67
government grants.

322
00:25:47,44 --> 00:25:53,11
They would be assisted with educational
programs that here they're simply.

323
00:25:53,13 --> 00:25:58,67
Denigrated ostracized made a legal
threatened with jail and fines.

324
00:26:00,96 --> 00:26:03,11
And.

325
00:26:05,61 --> 00:26:15,24
Why.

326
00:26:16,77 --> 00:26:20,88
Right.

327
00:26:21,66 --> 00:26:28,47
As well as the lame it was along

328
00:26:28,47 --> 00:26:33,91
with most i would say home birth midwives
qualified ones very much holistic

329
00:26:33,91 --> 00:26:38,71
practitioners and that really.

330
00:26:38,73 --> 00:26:42,20
Influences dramatically the
way they approach birth.

331
00:26:42,78 --> 00:26:52,13
As a life event a powerful
impact for the family involved.

332
00:26:52,15 --> 00:26:58,60
And interestingly enough if you
look at any nursing course.

333
00:26:58,62 --> 00:27:03,33
In fact the nurses registration board itself
defines nursing as an art as well as a

334
00:27:03,33 --> 00:27:03,81
science.

335
00:27:03,87 --> 00:27:09,49
They promote holistic nursing they promote
the actual use of intuition of ones.

336
00:27:10,18 --> 00:27:10,97
You know knowing

337
00:27:10,97 --> 00:27:16,97
that develops over time with
exposure to people in the healing

338
00:27:16,97 --> 00:27:20,87
and health professions.

339
00:27:20,89 --> 00:27:24,25
But in the hospital with this there isn't
room very much for this to happen.

340
00:27:24,50 --> 00:27:26,09
The people who are actually doing it.

341
00:27:27,43 --> 00:27:33,65
Tend to be those holistic nursing practitioners
who operate outside the system such

342
00:27:33,66 --> 00:27:37,90
as nurses who move into natural
medicine nurses who become.

343
00:27:38,14 --> 00:27:41,90
Midwives who become home
with practitioners.

344
00:27:42,61 --> 00:27:47,61
And women often mothers who take up.

345
00:27:47,63 --> 00:27:50,33
Lay midwifery who being birth assistance.

346
00:27:50,60 --> 00:27:55,17
They're the ones who are truly
providing holistic nursing care.

347
00:27:56,27 --> 00:27:59,50
It's an interesting irony.

348
00:28:11,19 --> 00:28:17,20
Well. The way that midwives use in
she was in for example in birth.

349
00:28:17,43 --> 00:28:18,76
Probably most often comes

350
00:28:18,76 --> 00:28:22,55
that we get situations of delay
where mothers seem to get stuck.

351
00:28:23,83 --> 00:28:25,84
No no further dilation of the cervix.

352
00:28:26,08 --> 00:28:30,34
An hour or two more and where the whole
process seems to be bogged down.

353
00:28:31,48 --> 00:28:34,40
Now if you were in hospital what would
happen would be they'd put up a drip

354
00:28:34,40 --> 00:28:36,94
and put in oxytocin to
stimulate the uterus

355
00:28:36,94 --> 00:28:41,29
and speed the whole process apple
they'd rupture your membranes.

356
00:28:41,31 --> 00:28:45,05
And they'd probably the main approaches.

357
00:28:45,26 --> 00:28:51,67
So it's kept it a very
physical process but.

358
00:28:51,68 --> 00:28:55,93
Holistic midwives would
look at that situation

359
00:28:56,69 --> 00:29:00,22
and wonder was there something
blocking the person.

360
00:29:00,24 --> 00:29:06,14
The mother involved and they
would wait. They would talk.

361
00:29:06,15 --> 00:29:11,08
They would use all kinds
of comforting measures.

362
00:29:11,10 --> 00:29:18,82
Everything from say hot towels a
physical pain to touch massage.

363
00:29:18,83 --> 00:29:21,43
And providing a really safe

364
00:29:21,43 --> 00:29:25,78
and loving environment for the
mother to get into her stuff

365
00:29:25,78 --> 00:29:28,13
and explore on an emotional
level. What's going on.

366
00:29:31,82 --> 00:29:37,25
Along with standard observation of mother
in baby you know fetal heart rate all of

367
00:29:37,25 --> 00:29:40,49
those sorts of things to make
sure that things were going well

368
00:29:41,47 --> 00:29:45,62
and we were remaining
within normal limits.

369
00:29:46,69 --> 00:29:51,43
And you get breakthroughs in those
situations for example i was at a birth.

370
00:29:51,45 --> 00:29:53,63
Some years ago where.

371
00:29:54,57 --> 00:29:58,85
The woman involved was running a
business and she was the mainstay of

372
00:29:58,85 --> 00:30:00,37
that business. And her partner.

373
00:30:02,26 --> 00:30:04,83
Knew a bit about it but she was
really deep down concerned

374
00:30:04,83 --> 00:30:10,03
that at the conflict between her having
to stop her involvement in the business

375
00:30:10,03 --> 00:30:16,84
and just be a mother and whether
that was going to be okay and.

376
00:30:18,50 --> 00:30:21,19
So she got to transition
and she just balked

377
00:30:21,19 --> 00:30:26,27
and she was very restless
an educated and anxious

378
00:30:26,27 --> 00:30:30,88
and crawling around on the bed for
an hour or something. This went on.

379
00:30:32,95 --> 00:30:38,38
And when we just lit it then we took her
and we cuddled there and we you know.

380
00:30:39,36 --> 00:30:43,64
Tried to help her get down into it and
finally she just burst out with it with.

381
00:30:45,06 --> 00:30:49,49
The words. Is it okay for
me to be the mother.

382
00:30:50,26 --> 00:30:54,40
And we all said yes it's a ok.

383
00:30:54,60 --> 00:30:57,81
And with that she just went
straight into second stage invested

384
00:30:57,81 --> 00:31:03,24
that well she just let go then and she
started to birth a baby and she set up.

385
00:31:04,13 --> 00:31:06,17
In a sort of meditation
position and she said.

386
00:31:07,40 --> 00:31:09,48
After you know a few more
minutes of just calm

387
00:31:09,48 --> 00:31:15,60
and relaxing she said i feel all full
of light and then baby came out.

388
00:31:15,61 --> 00:31:20,24
And those would have situations just don't
happen very really you know hospital

389
00:31:21,40 --> 00:31:24,20
and. That's why women choose home birth.

390
00:31:25,96 --> 00:31:31,22
That's why a lot of midwives go into a
home birth because they can be real

391
00:31:31,23 --> 00:31:32,76
authentic midwives.

392
00:31:33,87 --> 00:31:36,84
They can be creative spiritually

393
00:31:36,85 --> 00:31:43,05
and emotionally as well as competent
responsible practitioners taking care of the

394
00:31:43,05 --> 00:31:43,23
physical

395
00:31:50,85 --> 00:31:51,97
water birth and.
