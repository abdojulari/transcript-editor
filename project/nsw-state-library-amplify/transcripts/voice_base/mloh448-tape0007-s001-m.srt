1
00:00:01,97 --> 00:00:20,58
Right. I get off the veins you bring me back around to your way of the track. You should like a recording there.

2
00:00:20,7 --> 00:00:25,99
If you want to. All right from the very beginning it all goes on tightly around there.

3
00:00:26,06 --> 00:00:37,86
So I've been trying to dig up a few more possible very strange reactions even the slightest thought one guy over thirty

4
00:00:37,86 --> 00:00:41,48
years he's not telling what was going on.

5
00:00:41,51 --> 00:00:50,34
Oh is he still worth anything and where the thing he said but my voice is written down here.

6
00:00:50,44 --> 00:00:55,19
Here's a date even checked up with a guy for thirty years.

7
00:00:55,29 --> 00:00:57,63
He's got one sister lives in cars

8
00:00:57,63 --> 00:01:06,76
but he knows all except So I said this is not a minute it gives us that here with the Larry. These night talk shows.

9
00:01:06,8 --> 00:01:14,42
I do want to give us just probably out of the box that yeah every night of the third in the closet

10
00:01:14,42 --> 00:01:16,94
when they are not that far in is in the flip

11
00:01:16,94 --> 00:01:27,03
and I think we've I mean we've had a number of people who were quite worried about about the response of the night

12
00:01:27,03 --> 00:01:32,13
and it's enormous. And it's all good. So it's all going into the building.

13
00:01:32,13 --> 00:01:39,28
You brought it up are much describe replies from winds and Bill's describing time yeah this is what you're up for

14
00:01:39,28 --> 00:01:50,81
and we had that one loves his quite well known around town I guess. And I mean lots of people.

15
00:01:50,96 --> 00:01:59,13
And he was terrified and he kept saying you have to just take.

16
00:02:00,93 --> 00:02:03,72
So we turned it off and then he said Oh that's all right.

17
00:02:03,78 --> 00:02:07,33
And then we start again you know and maybe his friend was sitting there saying something.

18
00:02:07,34 --> 00:02:08,1
What was he naming

19
00:02:08,1 --> 00:02:15,13
but now that's the only possible is how you know I mean he's I mean it's not something I don't think I don't get one

20
00:02:15,13 --> 00:02:20,11
types of Woodstock the type you see how they do that even with a day without their permission.

21
00:02:20,6 --> 00:02:29,38
You know it's strange but I can understand them in one way not really

22
00:02:29,38 --> 00:02:36,95
and have what's the hardest I would manage to somebody who is well into their seventy's.

23
00:02:37,02 --> 00:02:39,4
Well I'm going to bring a friend.

24
00:02:39,48 --> 00:02:44,82
That's a bit of a state where you have somebody you know somebody knows you know the best coffee connection

25
00:02:44,82 --> 00:02:53,54
but he's well into his eighty's and still going out weeks ago saying you know he would really go back to

26
00:02:53,54 --> 00:03:03,51
and they would be very very accurately ready that you know you do you know with any sort of awareness of the sort of

27
00:03:03,51 --> 00:03:14,8
action. Plenty of pressure before. He just wants to talk about it on the fringe of conversation.

28
00:03:14,84 --> 00:03:17,85
He's dropped a lot of stories.

29
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:20,68
There's not a made in the seventy's

30
00:03:20,68 --> 00:03:30,24
and you quite a bit about that this is I tell you that college they confirmed what I got from a very awkward around

31
00:03:30,24 --> 00:03:42,31
calls you know something you can almost get that used to pass. You know you know what the hell is no. I've never could.

32
00:03:42,31 --> 00:03:45,66
I mean I was there wasn't a foot in the lake to me to think about

33
00:03:45,66 --> 00:04:00,03
but I want to get out of here context to the logical stuff you feel some of the stuff this might be real if you're

34
00:04:00,03 --> 00:04:06,67
going to assess. You know what I have to say I think what I saw was a crazed or unimpressed.

35
00:04:07,31 --> 00:04:20,05
I was going to give a little family background to put this into perspective their influence will help to begin with I

36
00:04:20,05 --> 00:04:20,77
was adopted

37
00:04:22,64 --> 00:04:34,84
and the guys there are born in twenty three there was a white list of children not exactly the adoption was not popular

38
00:04:36,89 --> 00:04:42,7
in large mother referring to my daughter is now out of whack in regard.

39
00:04:42,74 --> 00:04:58,64
Right now because in almost all of the natural mothers It just appears the white guy has a lot of affection goes back

40
00:04:58,64 --> 00:04:59,13
to child.

41
00:05:01,15 --> 00:05:08,46
But there was no attempt in those days to match that idea of what they do a taped

42
00:05:08,46 --> 00:05:11,55
and that physically a little bit of background noise

43
00:05:11,55 --> 00:05:31,01
and even the very early days of the time that they will take their reactions. But very successful family.

44
00:05:33,4 --> 00:05:46,66
But it was now it said there was a long waiting list. I think it's done enough start. And that's the worst.

45
00:05:48,56 --> 00:05:58,98
That I wasn't physically Robert was. But it will be a long succession of different sizes. As well fed will get there.

46
00:05:59,07 --> 00:06:10,48
Yeah right. But God does. What damage that would do things like that. But.

47
00:06:13,94 --> 00:06:31,58
As a result I grew up with it but I was much brought to the very beginning there was resentment because they married.

48
00:06:34,39 --> 00:06:51,34
Up to that point their. Things their clothes when they took them back to. The family. Actually.

49
00:06:56,79 --> 00:07:24,29
Don't do it then you get caught. Well. She was a person which is very strong. Very very soft. And I was watching.

50
00:07:28,75 --> 00:07:59,46
Very strong. Not broad. But he had three of the name of religion in his Christian.

51
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:02,3
You want to start just just keep going. I think our next story right.

52
00:13:02,31 --> 00:13:16,29
And this is a narrative that I read Life as an American value and that is that. This writer avoided one of at a time.

53
00:13:18,01 --> 00:13:29,9
But the end result of this very very let's say restricted top it up bringing that first diet back.

54
00:13:29,97 --> 00:13:44,67
I found almost impossible state of the share that was just right. More than this back. Stay there is no I don't.

55
00:13:44,67 --> 00:13:53,03
It was a there was a guy that was just really there because even previous to that I was not the right one for pissing

56
00:13:53,03 --> 00:14:00,03
in public life but with the movies of wifely and the hurt that I want to do this.

57
00:14:00,09 --> 00:14:01,86
This was just too late

58
00:14:01,86 --> 00:14:15,08
and even using the i've told it's it was excruciating down this place they had saw it was that night so I sit there

59
00:14:15,08 --> 00:14:22,27
looking across to the other one was. This is Are you OK.

60
00:14:22,47 --> 00:14:32,69
This time but at the office there are so that I still couldn't get a wife because I don't know what I was in school

61
00:14:32,69 --> 00:14:49,36
when the war. Yeah six day like whether it's a little pill that we have a good time which is just sort of all.

62
00:14:55,55 --> 00:14:58,63
That fish and bread.

63
00:15:00,31 --> 00:15:19,52
After that had no one's home one which is the place where I think most of this is that why it was they said it was

64
00:15:19,67 --> 00:15:20,44
absolutely.

65
00:15:22,46 --> 00:15:31,83
It's the right thing to label the guy for siting in this stuff is because I was never a place you know that place

66
00:15:32,6 --> 00:15:42,27
and I didn't look at it said I and they refuse the Green Day But I think their eyes.

67
00:15:42,35 --> 00:15:45,48
There was twenty one and they used to say shout.

68
00:15:45,57 --> 00:15:59,35
We had no idea at this point the shining of the cache I didn't put a lot of fights for kids here the dream was a ladder

69
00:15:59,35 --> 00:16:15,74
stile about to break something else but they knew I was wrong because all for their image so that I grew up the term

70
00:16:15,74 --> 00:16:29,21
and to do nothing that I see right there out there at all that we don't know right.

71
00:16:29,45 --> 00:16:41,26
Teligent I wouldn't want to that is a place you know that we can have common sense you know since you have none.

72
00:16:41,41 --> 00:16:59,25
So I had about a week. The wife back on the law and crossed out.

73
00:17:00,7 --> 00:17:10,41
Used to come in the city and what it was was it in the by rotten cross between two out.

74
00:17:11,2 --> 00:17:23,46
Still a lot of this particular point in the world history is not so we were put there wife

75
00:17:25,95 --> 00:17:37,34
and the catch was I to my game a while back

76
00:17:38,12 --> 00:17:43,54
and I was trying to say there was nobody in large groups that stuff like that.

77
00:17:43,59 --> 00:17:47,49
So I was only about the studio

78
00:17:47,49 --> 00:18:00,28
and I think the second time we went to say just there we went up to the OP I was a diver.

79
00:18:01,12 --> 00:18:13,83
This is the fish to it he had been in Wichita and didn't like any impression on the thinking back of my youth.

80
00:18:13,97 --> 00:18:20,87
There was a resistance saying so even then California or San Francisco I was told.

81
00:18:21,04 --> 00:18:38,75
Anyway he said to come on Sunday that fronted up the box with Texas dry

82
00:18:38,75 --> 00:18:49,45
and then six thirty to the South Street second in the light.

83
00:18:49,61 --> 00:18:51,64
Yes to go on this or that stuff

84
00:18:53,57 --> 00:19:02,6
but it's my eyes to see that there's a something like the region here stays with data another area to look there is the

85
00:19:02,6 --> 00:19:07,01
mind and the leaning on the best looking day

86
00:19:07,01 --> 00:19:17,23
and remember feeling this something was touching what I could still hear something sort of living ever so slightly

87
00:19:17,23 --> 00:19:26,04
against my very very cautiously to my head young Americans are very proud of the prejudice.

88
00:19:26,1 --> 00:19:39,33
They're very delicately that it was very crowded. It's hard to to be pretty and I tried desperately to include it.

89
00:19:41,51 --> 00:19:49,58
So I still had it which is only taught C.

90
00:19:49,81 --> 00:20:02,66
Well you know Wolf and that is that this is so low that even then I don't think you guys hear it like radios yet.

91
00:20:03,39 --> 00:20:10,23
I think the only thing they don't stride with the list.

92
00:20:10,39 --> 00:20:27,63
They're a strong list but if San Francisco guide that I was doing something that for so. Was there in Sydney today.

93
00:20:28,76 --> 00:20:39,64
You know the first day or so if it was to be fundraising something like grab the title.

94
00:20:40,75 --> 00:20:45,08
Yes we don't do this in the act but it was all fun day. It wasn't serious.

95
00:20:45,33 --> 00:20:49,45
It's a real trial like the sort of thing I do.

96
00:20:49,85 --> 00:21:03,97
Number one creatively answer how we got a while have lost looking out for the real one on the front office.

97
00:21:04,86 --> 00:21:27,01
This could be recognizable as the southern suburbs. I think that's me and. Trey's drives.

98
00:21:28,48 --> 00:21:53,44
Dave to series one he was part of it was a dozen friends down in the cellar with a truck.

99
00:21:54,77 --> 00:22:05,03
It was the one we all judge whether there's one particular race black which think it is fighting the Alpha does this

100
00:22:05,03 --> 00:22:16,53
matter a little when they're ready young host Don't do this don't do this limited to get a good life

101
00:22:17,55 --> 00:22:19,21
and there was no car in the garage.

102
00:22:19,98 --> 00:22:28,59
This is a highly paid for right and the right one quite like one or two more the whole thing.

103
00:22:29,39 --> 00:22:39,51
So I got it all drive south saw the highway bridge ways on that way to pay to live within the hour now.

104
00:22:39,51 --> 00:22:45,22
Is it on SR says he's still in this black outfit. You know I had to say that hat.

105
00:22:45,25 --> 00:22:48,84
There was that big long black clouds everything.

106
00:22:49,52 --> 00:22:55,98
It's like dealing with Laddie and he said what does he do when he got to be we going to change at comes to town

107
00:22:56,11 --> 00:22:58,15
and he's sitting at the front here of.

108
00:22:59,18 --> 00:23:08,09
We're all just about to do except run out why are you guys I have a great captive tall guy because this love like air

109
00:23:08,12 --> 00:23:14,65
comes that with it's one of the silly six that that I had dropped it was there.

110
00:23:14,88 --> 00:23:19,03
I've never saw your face like the three actually just took their eyes

111
00:23:19,03 --> 00:23:24,65
but they offered because shot as he didn't realize it was drugs or things because he has these voices

112
00:23:24,79 --> 00:23:29,15
but if you are going to do it.

113
00:23:32,06 --> 00:23:44,55
With the dross like these are quite private but I think that the war in the drags that the time is usually

114
00:23:44,55 --> 00:23:45,1
when the Irish

115
00:23:45,1 --> 00:23:55,8
or the Kiwis is like My Lai rant alone in forty seven lighters that we want to see you know where they're not in Sydney

116
00:23:56,41 --> 00:24:06,1
but it isn't so easy to use that very profession as if anything that their forces produce story in their stride

117
00:24:06,1 --> 00:24:12,36
or their merry way that we've done that actually started really well but the key ways from here.

118
00:24:12,39 --> 00:24:18,94
Considering the size of the tundra and there's always been that twenty years behind us and if anything this time

119
00:24:18,94 --> 00:24:26,19
and social acceptance and rate of one of those there was a whole variety show.

120
00:24:26,22 --> 00:24:37,07
Yes you had the miles in uniform you had drag queens. Mary singers. It was a real draw to the drug war rooms.

121
00:24:37,14 --> 00:24:49,37
Yeah I mean except. Let me try and it was a raft of it. I know how I thought how is he thought. Yes that.

122
00:24:50,04 --> 00:24:53,18
Yet another service that date serious I did Jodi.

123
00:24:53,54 --> 00:24:59,00
But the drag queen tonight I always took a week off of the year and there's a lot back

124
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:08,26
and saw a group right here right there as to what the person that I was discussing this with this friend last night

125
00:25:09,88 --> 00:25:23,19
and he is tonight dragged to his little Caylee to some of the interesting.

126
00:25:23,25 --> 00:25:33,22
They're trying to tell you what happened to the dressing then I mean to not sign that said off I think a lot of

127
00:25:33,25 --> 00:25:40,21
attention a lot of paid to him but not long after that he was going to parties

128
00:25:40,21 --> 00:25:49,72
and so are some of the most serious really intentional and they had to type taxis right here to get to

129
00:25:49,72 --> 00:26:02,62
and from the five because if I was out for the Jewish boy the best of that stuff probably pre-war too probably prevail

130
00:26:02,91 --> 00:26:09,32
in the truck here who actually bought it. If they are doing what's right.

131
00:26:09,58 --> 00:26:20,65
Here and all but I think they were pretty tight and I would say that the guys are nothing.

132
00:26:21,8 --> 00:26:23,62
It was a time

133
00:26:23,62 --> 00:26:37,6
when all of us right up in the fifty's who live this way to get us so these little things for the hard hat.

134
00:26:37,61 --> 00:26:46,78
She couldn't sit so the only way to get this far right supposed steady I guess I got the racist way to get it

135
00:26:46,78 --> 00:26:55,12
and that it was the one who had a lot of the hair. She died that I was facing a fall and three different ways of life.

136
00:26:57,02 --> 00:27:04,08
He was going to be the man had it as you build and they still had when they stood on top of this poor innocent page.

137
00:28:36,7 --> 00:35:24,87
After. What. Thought our thoughts our thoughts. Thought I thought.
