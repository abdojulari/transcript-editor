1
00:00:12,24 --> 00:00:16,88
Yeah.

2
00:00:16,90 --> 00:00:22,32
I think that the community certainly
didn't see me as any sort of guru

3
00:00:22,32 --> 00:00:28,46
or as any sort of highly
qualified or adept counsellor.

4
00:00:28,76 --> 00:00:30,80
People didn't come to me for counselling

5
00:00:30,80 --> 00:00:37,43
and they didn't treat me in in public
theaters as if i had anything particular.

6
00:00:37,53 --> 00:00:38,70
To offer.

7
00:00:40,10 --> 00:00:46,25
The various debates because i was
working in lismore as a psychiatrist

8
00:00:46,25 --> 00:00:52,75
and i was therefore very much a part
of the dominant paradigm. So i was.

9
00:00:54,74 --> 00:00:55,77
That part of me

10
00:00:55,77 --> 00:01:00,65
that aspect of me being a psychiatrist
they i think they just rejected that.

11
00:01:01,65 --> 00:01:06,78
Fortunately i had. And
alter ego was amusing.

12
00:01:06,80 --> 00:01:13,69
And i think an awful lot of people
really chose to relate to me as

13
00:01:13,69 --> 00:01:18,23
a talented musa i was
only working part time

14
00:01:18,23 --> 00:01:22,81
and so i was able to do a lot of music
and teach at the local community school

15
00:01:22,81 --> 00:01:26,05
and do all of those sorts of things so.

16
00:01:26,07 --> 00:01:31,88
My identity as a psychiatrist wasn't important
except as i said with the policeman

17
00:01:31,88 --> 00:01:32,74
to some extent

18
00:01:33,50 --> 00:01:39,27
and maybe with the townsfolk it gave gave
me a bit of an eye on trade to to move

19
00:01:39,27 --> 00:01:44,68
and talk with those people perhaps
more frequently than other people did

20
00:01:44,68 --> 00:01:46,67
but certainly as far as
the tribe was concerned

21
00:01:46,67 --> 00:01:50,47
that wasn't what they wanted
to know about me even though.

22
00:01:50,49 --> 00:01:52,68
All i have i shouldn't say even though.

23
00:01:53,16 --> 00:01:56,47
I guess one of the reasons that i
was able to survive it all was

24
00:01:56,47 --> 00:01:59,49
that i had a reputation for
being an aunty psychiatrist.

25
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,12
While that i mean is
bizarre in the extreme.

26
00:02:04,13 --> 00:02:07,94
Anti-psychiatry was that interesting.

27
00:02:09,69 --> 00:02:16,10
Deviation that. Occurred
in the late 60s. With.

28
00:02:16,66 --> 00:02:23,41
Ron lange the. The british
psychiatrist who.

29
00:02:25,14 --> 00:02:30,98
Discovered existentialism which
most psychiatrists in the 50s

30
00:02:30,98 --> 00:02:32,54
and 60s.

31
00:02:32,56 --> 00:02:34,47
And before that of course
knew nothing about

32
00:02:34,47 --> 00:02:41,44
but he was a psychiatrist who
read existentialism and.

33
00:02:42,19 --> 00:02:47,70
There were a number of who did but he
importantly then decided of course

34
00:02:47,70 --> 00:02:51,71
that somebody who was paranoid
and who was rejecting.

35
00:02:53,03 --> 00:02:57,47
You know the dominant paradigm
through their paranoia.

36
00:02:57,49 --> 00:03:03,08
Was probably more in contact with reality
than the people who didn't a very

37
00:03:03,08 --> 00:03:03,29
romantic

38
00:03:03,29 --> 00:03:10,21
and sentimental notion with which i was
absolutely captivated as a young psychiatrist

39
00:03:10,21 --> 00:03:13,50
so. You know when various.

40
00:03:15,43 --> 00:03:17,56
People with terrible mental illness.

41
00:03:18,20 --> 00:03:24,20
Even when i was a trainee
expounded on the theories

42
00:03:24,20 --> 00:03:26,07
that.

43
00:03:26,08 --> 00:03:32,92
You know they were likely to be
annihilated by various forces in the

44
00:03:32,92 --> 00:03:39,00
society and their predatory
and capitalist parents.

45
00:03:39,68 --> 00:03:42,08
I mean i was only too willing to hear this

46
00:03:42,08 --> 00:03:47,59
and to hear it as a valid
interpretation of reality

47
00:03:47,59 --> 00:03:51,65
and to therefore see them.

48
00:03:52,84 --> 00:03:54,46
Being dealt with as if they were sick

49
00:03:54,46 --> 00:03:59,79
and invalidated having those
experiences invalidated as definitely.

50
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,05
Part of the problem so.

51
00:04:01,50 --> 00:04:07,52
That was i was quite comfortable with the
label of being an anti psychiatrist even

52
00:04:07,52 --> 00:04:12,09
though i worked with people who
were seriously mentally ill

53
00:04:13,20 --> 00:04:18,29
and. Used drugs and treated them
in fairly conventional ways.

54
00:04:19,48 --> 00:04:21,44
That's not to say that i
didn't try the other way

55
00:04:21,44 --> 00:04:25,71
and the research project i referred to
earlier was one where i really was trying

56
00:04:25,71 --> 00:04:32,59
very hard to deal with man
people as if they were totally

57
00:04:32,59 --> 00:04:39,48
responsible human beings as if they were
creating the sorts of dilemmas they

58
00:04:39,48 --> 00:04:45,51
got into. As authentic portrayals of.

59
00:04:45,53 --> 00:04:51,47
Of their political and
personal reality. But.

60
00:04:52,77 --> 00:04:59,69
Of course it just didn't help them. All
it. It didn't help them certainly.

61
00:05:01,37 --> 00:05:04,09
Validating the paranoid

62
00:05:04,10 --> 00:05:10,09
and delusional experiences of people who
have some sort of mental disorders is

63
00:05:10,10 --> 00:05:14,68
useful. I'm sure it provides
them with some comfort

64
00:05:15,52 --> 00:05:17,30
but actually.

65
00:05:17,32 --> 00:05:23,12
On its own it's really not going to
stop them from probably perishing

66
00:05:23,12 --> 00:05:27,23
or killing somebody else and
and you know i am a doctor

67
00:05:27,23 --> 00:05:28,43
and other people are doctors

68
00:05:28,43 --> 00:05:34,21
or psychiatrists because for
some reason we we decided that.

69
00:05:34,84 --> 00:05:40,53
It's probably a mark of a humane community
if they don't let those people die

70
00:05:40,53 --> 00:05:43,29
or will carry other people away with them.

71
00:05:43,50 --> 00:05:47,22
Because of their strange beliefs
but anyhow i think the fact

72
00:05:47,22 --> 00:05:51,72
that i was known as an anti
psychiatrist and that i'd suffered no.

73
00:05:51,74 --> 00:05:55,47
Not even considerably from my peers.

74
00:05:55,49 --> 00:05:59,65
You know they've failed me in my
exams the first time. But i mean i.

75
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,88
And up at this. You know formidable

76
00:06:02,88 --> 00:06:09,63
and important final exam in psychiatry
with larry you know hair down to my waist

77
00:06:09,64 --> 00:06:11,97
in a duffel coat and.

78
00:06:12,91 --> 00:06:17,57
Probably be in things i mean the next time
i sat for the exam which you're allowed

79
00:06:17,57 --> 00:06:21,90
to do every six months i wore a three
piece suit and had a whisky first

80
00:06:21,90 --> 00:06:25,57
and had my hair cut and past
the exam but i mean the fact

81
00:06:25,57 --> 00:06:27,44
that i was an any psychiatrist

82
00:06:27,44 --> 00:06:34,38
and a high profile one in the media in
the early 70s probably also helped me

83
00:06:34,38 --> 00:06:38,70
to be quite accepted by the tribe.

84
00:06:38,72 --> 00:06:52,35
Up there.

85
00:06:53,94 --> 00:06:59,06
Well i. Yes i think that.

86
00:07:00,57 --> 00:07:02,21
It's very hard to know of course whether.

87
00:07:02,76 --> 00:07:07,51
Niman or whether the fact
that my friend petroff

88
00:07:07,51 --> 00:07:14,00
and i set up a psychiatric service in
lismore is what's responsible for the fact

89
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:16,56
that there's probably
on a percentage basis.

90
00:07:17,99 --> 00:07:22,60
A few more you know seriously
mentally ill people around him

91
00:07:22,60 --> 00:07:27,83
and then there there would
be around tamworth.

92
00:07:27,85 --> 00:07:31,53
You know when you set up
a psychiatric service.

93
00:07:32,71 --> 00:07:36,90
Then you are you attract a group of
people who are likely to need and use

94
00:07:36,90 --> 00:07:42,73
that service. Well we set up the psych
service in 73 in lismore and him

95
00:07:42,73 --> 00:07:47,44
and gets going in 73 and i think that.

96
00:07:47,46 --> 00:07:50,13
Just time extent those
two things are mixed in.

97
00:07:51,25 --> 00:07:58,19
There's only slightly more genuinely
mentally ill people around

98
00:07:58,20 --> 00:08:03,55
there. Than the. Would be in any other
population but there certainly are.

99
00:08:04,13 --> 00:08:11,13
And the capacity of that community to
tolerate people whose mood swings.

100
00:08:12,77 --> 00:08:16,29
Can create a bit of havoc in their own
lives and those of their loved ones.

101
00:08:16,32 --> 00:08:18,43
It's probably greater out there

102
00:08:18,43 --> 00:08:24,59
and the capacity of the community to
tolerate people who will live almost a feral

103
00:08:24,59 --> 00:08:25,85
sort of life

104
00:08:27,09 --> 00:08:32,82
and have some very disturbed sort of
beliefs is certainly greater than it is

105
00:08:32,82 --> 00:08:35,06
elsewhere and there's no doubt that.

106
00:08:36,41 --> 00:08:40,31
You know there is a greater incidence of
madness but i don't think for a moment

107
00:08:40,31 --> 00:08:44,76
that that's the environment that's
producing the madness i just.

108
00:08:45,68 --> 00:08:51,51
That's a drift adrift of a group of pretty
deviant people into a situation where

109
00:08:51,51 --> 00:08:54,21
they they can survive more easily

110
00:08:54,21 --> 00:09:06,78
and less obviously than than present
practically anywhere else in australia.

111
00:09:12,90 --> 00:09:14,55
Well i mean i only see

112
00:09:15,57 --> 00:09:21,45
that group of ferals who
probably do have schizophrenia.

113
00:09:23,50 --> 00:09:24,02
I've no doubt

114
00:09:24,02 --> 00:09:31,35
that there's a you know a shadow
around a central central group of.

115
00:09:32,46 --> 00:09:37,70
Heroic mad people there is
a shadow of people who are

116
00:09:39,38 --> 00:09:43,59
less heroic and less mad with whom
i'm never coming to any contact

117
00:09:43,59 --> 00:09:46,42
and i think

118
00:09:46,42 --> 00:09:52,06
that their motivation is
something which probably is not

119
00:09:53,29 --> 00:09:59,95
not too different from a basic an archaic
old rejection of the dominant paris.

120
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,82
Time just over ours was 20 years ago
i remember and one of the reasons

121
00:10:05,82 --> 00:10:07,54
that i moved out of nimbin.

122
00:10:08,02 --> 00:10:12,95
Because when i left paradise valley after
a few years after 10 years really.

123
00:10:13,23 --> 00:10:16,67
I moved into a house in town
right in the middle of town.

124
00:10:18,32 --> 00:10:24,69
And one of the ferals began
shitting on my front lawn.

125
00:10:26,09 --> 00:10:27,73
And he wasn't a crazy at all.

126
00:10:27,83 --> 00:10:32,07
He was a drunk and a few other things

127
00:10:33,30 --> 00:10:35,94
but he certainly wasn't mentally
ill or anything like that

128
00:10:35,94 --> 00:10:39,42
and one time after each shat
on the lawn and i went out

129
00:10:40,41 --> 00:10:43,41
and walked by him on my way
out to the car to go to work.

130
00:10:44,73 --> 00:10:47,79
I just said look that is really vile

131
00:10:49,38 --> 00:10:55,93
and i mean he gave me this highly
articulate rave about how it was his lawn.

132
00:10:55,95 --> 00:11:00,31
I mean it was my lawn but i
mean it was his lawn and.

133
00:11:00,33 --> 00:11:01,92
I couldn't cope with

134
00:11:01,92 --> 00:11:06,41
that i just thought i'm i just i'm
not going to be able to live here.

135
00:11:06,47 --> 00:11:13,08
I mean i can hear what he's saying. You
know this is his planet this is his lawn.

136
00:11:14,48 --> 00:11:20,22
He have got if he said he's got
a right to shit on this lawn.

137
00:11:20,24 --> 00:11:27,04
I matter of fact at the time. I hadn't
realized that rights were all bullshit.

138
00:11:27,06 --> 00:11:30,09
I must say that i have
changed in 20 years and all

139
00:11:30,09 --> 00:11:35,96
and some of my ideas have have distilled
into something quite different from what

140
00:11:35,96 --> 00:11:36,57
they were before.

141
00:11:38,46 --> 00:11:42,69
So now if somebody said something to me
about how they had a right to shoot on my

142
00:11:42,69 --> 00:11:46,72
lawn. I probably wouldn't
react the way i did then.

143
00:11:46,80 --> 00:11:51,63
But i was deeply moved by it and i
couldn't think of an argument against it

144
00:11:52,43 --> 00:11:58,43
and i began in my mind thinking of leaving
nimbin because i would have to because.

145
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,51
Simply because i couldn't cope
with him shitting on my lawn

146
00:12:02,51 --> 00:12:04,91
but i thought it was okay
for him to sit on my lawn.

147
00:12:06,44 --> 00:12:12,04
So i would have to go because
i mean i could ask him to go.

148
00:12:12,06 --> 00:12:17,79
I just i remember once on the farm a
fairly feral bloke was living there for a

149
00:12:17,79 --> 00:12:21,76
while and he ran up an $800
phone bill on my phone

150
00:12:23,72 --> 00:12:27,95
and i said to him. This
is unbelievable. You.

151
00:12:27,98 --> 00:12:32,46
You'll have to pay this money
and he saw i can get me money.

152
00:12:32,48 --> 00:12:37,83
And i'm not going to pay it
and and why should i pay it.

153
00:12:37,84 --> 00:12:41,34
You know you've got the phone
and and you've got the money

154
00:12:41,34 --> 00:12:44,01
and i needed to make all
these phone calls to perth

155
00:12:44,93 --> 00:12:49,95
and i remember i burst into tears and i
said well all i can do is ask you to leave.

156
00:12:50,34 --> 00:12:52,04
I can only ask you to leave.

157
00:12:52,20 --> 00:12:56,61
We didn't have a rule where you could
actually send somebody away so

158
00:12:58,36 --> 00:13:00,85
that was a second occasion where you know

159
00:13:00,85 --> 00:13:05,94
when somebody asserted at me
a right to behave in a way

160
00:13:05,94 --> 00:13:10,98
that was seriously impacting on me i
couldn't think of an argument against

161
00:13:10,98 --> 00:13:14,38
that and i moved off the valley.

162
00:13:14,40 --> 00:13:18,20
I've paid the bill and moved off
the valley because he wouldn't

163
00:13:19,46 --> 00:13:24,92
and i moved out of town because this
guy wouldn't not shit on my lawn

164
00:13:26,21 --> 00:13:31,00
and. So. I will.

165
00:13:31,06 --> 00:13:36,17
What was the question again there were.

166
00:13:39,98 --> 00:13:40,06
No.

167
00:13:41,04 --> 00:13:47,86
Yes yes yes yes yes well i
mean i've worked in my own

168
00:13:47,86 --> 00:13:54,54
mind. Now i'm i'm on to a different. I'm
on it i'm on a very different track.

169
00:13:55,70 --> 00:14:01,68
I. I believe that there has
been. A. That's serious.

170
00:14:07,27 --> 00:14:10,05
There is a cataclysms approaching

171
00:14:11,26 --> 00:14:17,93
that people who are spouse the notion
of individual freedom personal freedom

172
00:14:17,93 --> 00:14:23,43
and the right to do things are indeed.

173
00:14:23,45 --> 00:14:31,69
Now i think represent the most
serious danger to the planet.

174
00:14:31,71 --> 00:14:35,94
But whereas i thought before that.

175
00:14:37,13 --> 00:14:43,76
Those sorts of rights were
important for a person to feel

176
00:14:43,76 --> 00:14:46,72
as if they were moving
their world around them.

177
00:14:48,21 --> 00:14:49,87
I now feel of course

178
00:14:49,87 --> 00:14:56,28
that they absolutely run contrary to
a certain human connected with us

179
00:14:57,22 --> 00:15:03,08
which at least i now know is much more
important in me feeling like a worthwhile

180
00:15:03,08 --> 00:15:07,75
human being so groups that are about.

181
00:15:07,77 --> 00:15:12,12
Empowerment and groups that are about.

182
00:15:12,14 --> 00:15:18,96
Self-actualization and groups that are
about personal freedom now i think.

183
00:15:18,98 --> 00:15:21,33
Terrible. I think it's all wrong.

184
00:15:22,99 --> 00:15:29,22
It's rather a see it's a similar problem
to the problem where democracy which is

185
00:15:29,22 --> 00:15:33,74
one hundred fifty years old is a word and
a concept. If you don't count the greeks.

186
00:15:34,28 --> 00:15:36,73
Where democracy. The word

187
00:15:37,42 --> 00:15:44,35
and a vague idea has actually been hijacked
by a group of people who say it means

188
00:15:44,35 --> 00:15:47,30
freedom of choice.

189
00:15:47,32 --> 00:15:53,06
And that without the freedom to choose
there is no such thing as democracy.

190
00:15:53,15 --> 00:15:58,20
Of course democracy in its original
conception had nothing to do with the freedom

191
00:15:58,20 --> 00:15:59,94
of choice particularly nothing to do with.

192
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,69
The idea that you therefore have
to have six things to choose from.

193
00:16:04,29 --> 00:16:06,49
Or you're not operating in a democracy.

194
00:16:06,89 --> 00:16:10,12
I mean that the whole idea
of of bringing freedom

195
00:16:10,12 --> 00:16:16,16
and choice in i guess to simply
bolster materialism and consumerism.

196
00:16:16,81 --> 00:16:23,16
Has simply been a terribly an
incredibly ingenious hijacking of

197
00:16:23,91 --> 00:16:29,14
one of the aspects of democracy
into now what democracy now.

198
00:16:29,19 --> 00:16:31,35
Mean this is that you
have freedom to choose.

199
00:16:31,63 --> 00:16:33,24
Well the idea

200
00:16:33,24 --> 00:16:39,56
that you have to be a
self-determining human being has

201
00:16:39,57 --> 00:16:40,65
been hijacked.

202
00:16:41,28 --> 00:16:47,55
Again by a group of people
who for some reason

203
00:16:48,82 --> 00:16:50,94
don't like to think

204
00:16:52,00 --> 00:16:57,73
that in the final analysis we are
responsible for other people as well as for

205
00:16:57,73 --> 00:16:58,16
ourselves.

206
00:16:58,24 --> 00:17:03,75
Just as responsible for other people as
ourselves i mean we are very vulnerable

207
00:17:03,75 --> 00:17:06,91
creatures for the first
15 years of our life and

208
00:17:06,91 --> 00:17:11,34
and basically for the whole of our life
we do depend upon the goodwill of all of

209
00:17:11,34 --> 00:17:17,15
the other humans on the
planet to survive and.

210
00:17:17,17 --> 00:17:21,69
Things like goodwill and lovingkindness

211
00:17:21,69 --> 00:17:27,04
and all of those sorts of things
actually can disappear entirely.

212
00:17:27,57 --> 00:17:28,46
If you insist

213
00:17:29,33 --> 00:17:33,89
that the most important thing for a human
being to have is self-determination

214
00:17:35,62 --> 00:17:39,94
and free will because
you're really arguing

215
00:17:39,95 --> 00:17:46,70
that you shouldn't be coerced
impacted influenced by

216
00:17:47,55 --> 00:17:50,14
some other person but that's
an absolute nonsense.

217
00:17:50,62 --> 00:17:55,18
You absolutely need
advocacy influence you.

218
00:17:55,25 --> 00:17:59,00
Connectedness all of those things
in order to be a human being.

219
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,24
I'm personally against the
human rights movement.

220
00:18:02,28 --> 00:18:05,95
I have realised in the last
few years that i feel.

221
00:18:05,99 --> 00:18:08,72
And interestingly i've never
joined amnesty and i've

222
00:18:08,72 --> 00:18:12,60
and i've wondered why i
never joined amnesty

223
00:18:13,57 --> 00:18:17,43
and i won't be joining amnesty
because i don't believe

224
00:18:17,43 --> 00:18:23,34
that the human rights movement is the way
out of our terrible problem at the moment

225
00:18:24,33 --> 00:18:27,75
i think the human responsibilities
movement is the way out

226
00:18:28,59 --> 00:18:32,99
and i don't hear anybody talking
about it and i personally.

227
00:18:34,08 --> 00:18:39,74
Terribly uncomfortable about. You
know the freedom to privacy.

228
00:18:41,31 --> 00:18:43,11
This is just.

229
00:18:43,91 --> 00:18:51,03
An absolutely unnatural
state for human beings.

230
00:18:51,05 --> 00:18:53,03
And and most of the things

231
00:18:53,03 --> 00:18:56,94
that have now entered the
discourse as if they are rights.

232
00:18:58,51 --> 00:19:04,85
I think are a very very serious part of
well i can be uncomfortable about the old

233
00:19:04,85 --> 00:19:10,40
word alienation the alienation that
we are building into democracies.

234
00:19:10,92 --> 00:19:16,65
Now we're heading headlong away
from the human connectedness

235
00:19:16,65 --> 00:19:22,66
and the tribal stuff which is just

236
00:19:22,66 --> 00:19:27,04
crucial to the human to human being.

237
00:19:40,27 --> 00:19:43,84
Yes yes.

238
00:19:45,02 --> 00:19:49,48
Being your brother's keeper
in the broadest sense of it.

239
00:19:49,54 --> 00:19:51,89
Yes i am my brother's keeper.

240
00:19:52,17 --> 00:19:57,09
Just as i would want him to
be mine and the notion of.

241
00:19:57,77 --> 00:20:03,72
You know the personal freedom. And autonomy
autonomy what the hell is autonomy.

242
00:20:03,93 --> 00:20:09,78
You can't move without
impacting another human being

243
00:20:11,11 --> 00:20:15,02
whose comfort is critical to yours.

244
00:20:17,05 --> 00:20:21,39
You can't make an action without impacting
another human being whose comfort is

245
00:20:22,15 --> 00:20:28,75
ultimately going to be
incredibly influential on yours.

246
00:20:30,65 --> 00:20:33,05
So you know i find myself now.

247
00:20:35,72 --> 00:20:41,66
Feeling like a totally lone voice about
this whole human rights issue because

248
00:20:41,66 --> 00:20:44,82
certainly i mean when i
when i speak up about it.

249
00:20:44,95 --> 00:20:49,74
You know people look at me as if i'm
some sort of fascist. Maybe i am.

250
00:20:49,76 --> 00:20:56,24
But i'm actually coming from something
which is i think deeply spiritual.

251
00:20:57,47 --> 00:21:01,40
But i'm happy to call
that stuff connectedness.

252
00:21:02,05 --> 00:21:04,54
If spiritual makes people
feel uncomfortable.

253
00:21:05,26 --> 00:21:11,83
I'm on about human connectedness the
interdependence of our of our of our

254
00:21:11,83 --> 00:21:18,39
mind of our mental stuff and of our
mental life and this insistence on.

255
00:21:18,41 --> 00:21:23,91
Individuality personal autonomy choice

256
00:21:23,92 --> 00:21:28,95
and all of those sorts of things i think
is just the natural extension of the

257
00:21:28,95 --> 00:21:34,16
political disasters of the last
hundred years of democracy

258
00:21:34,16 --> 00:21:37,92
and it's re-interpretation and psychology

259
00:21:39,16 --> 00:21:43,54
and it's horrendous eilean asians from.

260
00:21:44,49 --> 00:21:47,88
You know through empiricism
and and behaviorism.

261
00:21:48,16 --> 00:21:54,59
It's it's it's a leap away

262
00:21:55,97 --> 00:21:59,58
from love and compassion which of course.

263
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:00,52
We only things

264
00:22:00,52 --> 00:22:08,22
that are really important about what

265
00:22:08,23 --> 00:22:08,66
things

266
00:22:17,02 --> 00:22:19,27
are you know. Absolutely absolutely.

267
00:22:19,84 --> 00:22:26,57
The events the tribal events the
concerts the folk clubs the feasts the

268
00:22:26,58 --> 00:22:29,17
dances the rituals

269
00:22:30,49 --> 00:22:36,28
that was what it was about for me growing
old with people who i've known now who

270
00:22:36,28 --> 00:22:37,39
i've now known for 20 years.

271
00:22:38,50 --> 00:22:41,58
Yes all of those things were
the most important things.

272
00:22:42,28 --> 00:22:49,09
As well as for me the actual
reconnecting with growing trees

273
00:22:49,09 --> 00:22:49,70
and

274
00:22:49,70 --> 00:22:56,67
and the season's which i think are
deeply important for all human beings

275
00:22:57,58 --> 00:23:02,12
and. Even though i lived for the first
10 years of my life in the country.

276
00:23:03,30 --> 00:23:08,31
I then spent the next 20 years
during my education in the city

277
00:23:09,14 --> 00:23:10,49
and i had.

278
00:23:10,50 --> 00:23:16,71
I had lost a lot of the the
warmth and the meaning of knowing

279
00:23:16,71 --> 00:23:22,65
that it was a full moon or four
or that the exquisite feeling

280
00:23:22,65 --> 00:23:26,47
that comes over the countryside
after a violent storm

281
00:23:26,47 --> 00:23:30,25
and then the clear eyed lost all
of that stuff you do in the city.

282
00:23:30,26 --> 00:23:33,42
You just not conscious of whether it's
winter or summer or raining or not.

283
00:23:34,52 --> 00:23:40,90
So the human tribal celebrate
tree things were wonderfully

284
00:23:40,90 --> 00:23:45,46
nourishing and then reconnecting
with the trees in the earth.

285
00:23:46,11 --> 00:23:51,06
Was the second thing that. You
know makes the whole thing for me.

286
00:23:52,70 --> 00:23:56,78
Well it's it is what it's what continues
to give my life. It's meaning.

287
00:24:05,51 --> 00:24:12,43
Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah i know well.

288
00:24:12,51 --> 00:24:14,84
Well actually the pictures balls something

289
00:24:14,84 --> 00:24:21,50
that still goes on blue not the
whole sadly as been. Overtaken by.

290
00:24:22,21 --> 00:24:26,44
Some rather violent episodes of life.

291
00:24:26,46 --> 00:24:32,12
As in the last 10 years of
course as alcohol been become.

292
00:24:32,69 --> 00:24:37,87
Is a really made a comeback in the any
alternative community certainly the level of

293
00:24:37,87 --> 00:24:40,60
violence of increased with.

294
00:24:40,61 --> 00:24:45,21
The level of increased alcohol
consumption in the first 10 years or so

295
00:24:45,21 --> 00:24:49,92
when we were all just smoking dope largely
at any sort of tribal gatherings.

296
00:24:49,93 --> 00:24:51,37
They were very much more peaceful

297
00:24:51,37 --> 00:24:55,30
but blue knob hall was of
course a very special venue

298
00:24:55,30 --> 00:24:58,87
and the new year's even the full
moon dances that we had a blue knob.

299
00:24:59,42 --> 00:25:04,96
Always just with the local musicians getting
together getting a repertoire together

300
00:25:04,96 --> 00:25:07,78
for the show.

301
00:25:07,79 --> 00:25:10,18
There were the usual musicians egos

302
00:25:10,18 --> 00:25:14,26
but basically it was often
possible to have 10

303
00:25:14,26 --> 00:25:17,42
or 15 people up on the stage.

304
00:25:17,43 --> 00:25:20,09
And of course we were
all wanting to be heard

305
00:25:20,09 --> 00:25:23,83
but we were all wanting to
hear each other too. So.

306
00:25:23,85 --> 00:25:30,10
Those those were the most precious.
And reinforcing parts of.

307
00:25:30,11 --> 00:25:34,44
Those early years blue knob hall
on a saturday night on a full moon

308
00:25:35,18 --> 00:25:39,10
or new year was just the
most extraordinary event.

309
00:25:40,74 --> 00:25:52,71
What was it.

310
00:25:56,97 --> 00:25:59,90
Now i can't say i can't see.

311
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,98
I what brought us all together unless it
was the same for other people as it was

312
00:26:05,98 --> 00:26:12,75
for me there is a tribe of like minded
people who were not going to follow a

313
00:26:12,75 --> 00:26:18,93
career path which would
continually disrupt their

314
00:26:19,83 --> 00:26:22,43
relationships. You know with each other.

315
00:26:24,09 --> 00:26:25,73
Thats what it was for me i knew

316
00:26:25,73 --> 00:26:29,53
that you know to be a successful psychiatrist
i would have to make a number of

317
00:26:29,53 --> 00:26:34,09
career moves that would be geographical
and i would lose my group over

318
00:26:34,09 --> 00:26:37,17
and over again so i think that.

319
00:26:38,59 --> 00:26:42,29
I would hazard a guess that
really all of the people

320
00:26:42,29 --> 00:26:47,84
that arrived up there with the view
that they were going to stay there

321
00:26:49,08 --> 00:26:54,32
and not make the usual geographical
moves that go with contemporary life.

322
00:26:54,67 --> 00:26:56,40
I'd say they all were there for

323
00:26:56,40 --> 00:27:00,67
that same tribal reason i wanted to make a
connection with a group of people whose

324
00:27:00,67 --> 00:27:01,94
faces they would all know.

325
00:27:02,53 --> 00:27:07,52
All the time and grow old with those
people even if i said i went there so

326
00:27:07,53 --> 00:27:11,58
that they could get into alternative power
or so they could get into anything else.

327
00:27:11,80 --> 00:27:12,98
I really feel

328
00:27:13,86 --> 00:27:18,69
that it was the desire to to have
this non-wrestling primary group

329
00:27:18,69 --> 00:27:19,54
that would stay still.

330
00:27:21,54 --> 00:27:32,18
That took us all where a

331
00:27:32,19 --> 00:27:36,87
sunny story about an image yes yes.

332
00:27:37,75 --> 00:27:41,62
We're before we'd all
moved up onto the farm.

333
00:27:41,64 --> 00:27:43,57
We used to go up there for the holidays

334
00:27:44,59 --> 00:27:48,45
and of course we'd all had mushrooms
i guess during the festival and

335
00:27:48,45 --> 00:27:49,12
that sort of thing

336
00:27:49,12 --> 00:27:52,89
but i think it was the very next
holidays we all found ourselves up there

337
00:27:52,89 --> 00:27:59,86
that would've been christmas 73 say.
And so the whole of the group of.

338
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:06,25
Yes the 12 of us who bought land in our
kids. Three or four kids were up there.

339
00:28:06,92 --> 00:28:10,72
And we were just arriving in dribs and
drabs as we'd driven up from sydney

340
00:28:10,72 --> 00:28:13,75
and the mushrooms were out in
the cowshed with everywhere.

341
00:28:13,83 --> 00:28:20,61
And so we were going to have our for
everyone was going to drop some

342
00:28:20,61 --> 00:28:24,71
mushrooms and most of us.

343
00:28:24,73 --> 00:28:27,46
Had had some mushrooms during the festival

344
00:28:27,46 --> 00:28:32,31
but whether there was one wonderful
woman who had never had any mushrooms

345
00:28:33,77 --> 00:28:39,86
and so we all took the mushrooms and
all got into the various states

346
00:28:39,86 --> 00:28:44,53
that you get into. When
you're tripping on mushrooms.

347
00:28:44,55 --> 00:28:47,31
And we all noticed about an hour later

348
00:28:48,13 --> 00:28:52,71
that this wonderful woman
had grabbed the broom.

349
00:28:53,08 --> 00:28:58,66
And she was dashing around the paddock
where we were all lying in various states

350
00:28:58,66 --> 00:29:00,23
or or whatever

351
00:29:01,22 --> 00:29:06,16
and she was sweeping the
cowpats into little piles.

352
00:29:07,73 --> 00:29:10,44
And at this point i
should say she's a virgo.

353
00:29:10,65 --> 00:29:15,19
And she was always the tidiest person
in the commune she was in charge of the

354
00:29:15,19 --> 00:29:17,26
washing up and the cooking and
all of this sort of thing

355
00:29:18,10 --> 00:29:22,55
and she had proceeded to tidy up
the cowshed in the paddock and

356
00:29:22,55 --> 00:29:26,13
when i said to our what the
hell are you doing. She said.

357
00:29:26,21 --> 00:29:34,44
When's this bloody stuff
going to start to work.

358
00:29:34,46 --> 00:29:38,12
With this the rest of us sort of
collapsed. You know how deep.

359
00:29:39,85 --> 00:29:41,36
And i think she realised

360
00:29:41,36 --> 00:29:52,35
that it was working.

361
00:29:53,08 --> 00:29:56,97
Yes. You've asked me what i
think about niman and drugs.

362
00:29:57,10 --> 00:29:59,61
The dark side of nim and the.

363
00:30:00,32 --> 00:30:07,28
It's now narcotics that's a very strong
scene in nimbin well obviously you know

364
00:30:07,28 --> 00:30:10,92
from the amount of time i've spent talking
to you about marijuana and mushrooms

365
00:30:10,92 --> 00:30:10,99
and

366
00:30:11,76 --> 00:30:17,65
and those sorts of things for me the the
drug taking part of niman was important.

367
00:30:18,90 --> 00:30:20,92
So i'm not at all surprised.

368
00:30:20,97 --> 00:30:27,06
Of course that there
is now a very obvious.

369
00:30:27,88 --> 00:30:32,22
Drug culture in nimbin and not surprised

370
00:30:32,22 --> 00:30:36,03
that of course it is.

371
00:30:36,97 --> 00:30:40,23
That rather than just being marijuana and.

372
00:30:41,62 --> 00:30:42,30
Mushrooms

373
00:30:42,31 --> 00:30:45,59
and those sorts of things which of course
are harmful i'm not suggesting they're

374
00:30:45,59 --> 00:30:48,99
not but rather than it being those
things. It's now narcotics.

375
00:30:50,30 --> 00:30:54,84
To be truthful i believe there's
just one very simple explanation.

376
00:30:56,16 --> 00:31:01,75
But it's not an opinion that
would be easy to to prove

377
00:31:02,48 --> 00:31:03,49
but.

378
00:31:03,51 --> 00:31:10,51
I think it is almost
entirely relates to the

379
00:31:10,51 --> 00:31:14,58
way the police actually
feel about people like me

380
00:31:15,83 --> 00:31:20,64
and about all of us who've come up
there. I think that the police.

381
00:31:20,65 --> 00:31:24,20
Well let's start a step back.

382
00:31:25,42 --> 00:31:30,53
I think envy is one of the most.

383
00:31:31,64 --> 00:31:37,65
Common human feelings i
mean it's not. It's not a.
