1
00:00:07,46 --> 00:00:11,27
You know the senate keep shining
the window keep blowing. The rain.

2
00:00:11,27 --> 00:00:16,91
You keep falling. These are all
things that keep happening for.

3
00:00:17,66 --> 00:00:22,91
As long as there's life on
earth you know that we don't.

4
00:00:23,80 --> 00:00:28,18
We don't need to have these insane
power systems that pollute the planet

5
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:31,57
and require lots of maintenance
and stuff anymore.

6
00:00:31,75 --> 00:00:35,89
You know the technology is
there today to provide power.

7
00:00:36,49 --> 00:00:43,43
At once fingertips without having
to having to fly once guts out

8
00:00:43,43 --> 00:00:55,56
in order to maintain a systems.

9
00:00:59,41 --> 00:01:04,26
Well. Back in the 70s

10
00:01:04,26 --> 00:01:11,18
or even further back in the 60s a lot
of people like myself how these views

11
00:01:11,18 --> 00:01:12,99
of.

12
00:01:15,50 --> 00:01:21,01
The world as it was not being able to
sustain itself very much longer a lot of

13
00:01:21,01 --> 00:01:27,29
other people in mainstream society would
say listen to these crazy hippies with

14
00:01:27,29 --> 00:01:28,59
their stupid ideas you know.

15
00:01:29,26 --> 00:01:34,04
They were to come back to reality and
see what it's all about but. Over.

16
00:01:34,07 --> 00:01:36,21
It's amazing. Over the last 20 years.

17
00:01:36,53 --> 00:01:42,87
How how people's acceptance of.

18
00:01:42,89 --> 00:01:49,67
The fact that we can keep on going the
way we were has changed. You know.

19
00:01:49,68 --> 00:01:54,19
Now where we are as an
extremist 20 years ago.

20
00:01:55,13 --> 00:01:57,04
Now my ideas are accepted everywhere.

21
00:01:57,35 --> 00:02:00,34
You know so i think there's been
some some amazing change. Is there.

22
00:02:01,15 --> 00:02:08,10
The problem is that. Although
people are all aware of what.

23
00:02:09,40 --> 00:02:13,83
Of the shortcomings of
society is as it stands.

24
00:02:13,85 --> 00:02:17,81
There's still not very many people are
really prepared to change their own life.

25
00:02:18,88 --> 00:02:21,97
You know they all agree with the
fact that something needs to be done

26
00:02:22,80 --> 00:02:27,75
but most people seem to be waiting
for somebody else to lead the way.

27
00:02:28,98 --> 00:02:32,26
And i guess that's what the rainbow tower
companies about we are trying to say look

28
00:02:32,26 --> 00:02:37,46
it's all here it's all available
when she just do it now. You know.

29
00:02:37,48 --> 00:02:41,19
And unfortunately one of the obstacles

30
00:02:41,19 --> 00:02:43,24
that we're still against at the moment is

31
00:02:43,24 --> 00:02:49,51
that in this city suburban environment our
power systems are not cost competitive

32
00:02:49,51 --> 00:02:50,78
with the grid system.

33
00:02:51,12 --> 00:02:56,51
They would be a lot more cost compared if
the grid system was incorporated all the

34
00:02:56,51 --> 00:03:00,36
real costs of the system
which i don't do anyway.

35
00:03:01,52 --> 00:03:05,26
We are cost competitive
in the rural environment.

36
00:03:05,28 --> 00:03:05,95
It's a pity

37
00:03:05,95 --> 00:03:09,86
that we're not a cost competitive message
environment i guess that's just only a

38
00:03:09,86 --> 00:03:10,54
matter of time.

39
00:03:10,89 --> 00:03:16,43
Even even with the cross-subsidisation
of systems the way they are today.

40
00:03:19,60 --> 00:03:22,92
If that doesn't change we will still
become cost competitive in the next decade

41
00:03:22,92 --> 00:03:28,07
or so just because
technology is improving and.

42
00:03:28,08 --> 00:03:32,74
Renewable energy systems are
improving all the time.

43
00:03:32,75 --> 00:03:37,03
Through.

44
00:03:39,75 --> 00:03:41,79
Some of our own products.

45
00:03:42,58 --> 00:03:44,16
They're aimed at our company products

46
00:03:44,16 --> 00:03:49,02
that we have for sale include
the micro-hydro system and

47
00:03:49,02 --> 00:03:53,79
when i was telling you there. We also.

48
00:03:53,81 --> 00:03:59,48
Develops a sine wave inverter. An
inverter is something that gives you.

49
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,02
I've all the js 8 like 240 volts
i say from a battery supply.

50
00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:12,24
Most inverters that are available
are well known as modified square.

51
00:04:12,30 --> 00:04:16,94
Step 2 square wave inverters the problem
with with those way forms out of the

52
00:04:16,94 --> 00:04:20,07
inverters is a lot of standard 240
volt equipment doesn't like it.

53
00:04:24,07 --> 00:04:26,66
And we felt that there was a.

54
00:04:27,82 --> 00:04:32,21
Great need in the marketplace for
a sine wave inverter so we went

55
00:04:32,21 --> 00:04:36,54
and developed their own sign my
finger which turns out to be a very.

56
00:04:37,07 --> 00:04:42,15
Furtively indestructible product which we
believe it's one of the best inverters in

57
00:04:42,15 --> 00:04:42,64
the market.

58
00:04:43,17 --> 00:04:48,35
And any standard 240 volt equipment within
the wattage rating of the invertible

59
00:04:48,35 --> 00:04:49,77
will run very happily off it.

60
00:04:51,56 --> 00:04:54,84
We are now in the process of
making a large inverter the one

61
00:04:54,84 --> 00:04:58,77
that we had so far was a
300 watt 12 oz inverter.

62
00:04:58,79 --> 00:05:04,03
We're now developing a 600 watt inverter
that's also got some other added features.

63
00:05:04,12 --> 00:05:09,07
It'll actually reverse as
a battery charge as well.

64
00:05:09,88 --> 00:05:12,24
And we believe it's going
to be a lot more efficient

65
00:05:12,24 --> 00:05:19,55
and then this more than there is.

66
00:05:19,57 --> 00:05:25,96
Change. And yeah.

67
00:05:28,47 --> 00:05:34,81
It's. I always like to keep power system
to simple as possible and from it with

68
00:05:34,81 --> 00:05:39,63
that in mind it seems a lot more sensible
if you have a battery bank have things

69
00:05:39,63 --> 00:05:44,20
that runs rector of the battery bank
than to have things stand to fortify the

70
00:05:44,20 --> 00:05:46,90
places for which you need
an inverter the problem is

71
00:05:46,90 --> 00:05:53,03
that the semi different pieces of equipment
a tape might want to have some of them

72
00:05:54,78 --> 00:05:57,73
probably very difficult if not
impossible to obtain as a d.c.

73
00:05:57,73 --> 00:05:59,80
Appliance and we're not in
the business of trying.

74
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,92
I to think of every possible appliance
and making an alternative available.

75
00:06:05,28 --> 00:06:08,10
We tell people about the
alternatives that we know about

76
00:06:08,81 --> 00:06:11,75
and occasionally some of the more popular
products will actually go out of her way

77
00:06:11,75 --> 00:06:13,41
to try and either.

78
00:06:14,55 --> 00:06:17,84
Source an alternative one or
manufacture one ourselves

79
00:06:17,84 --> 00:06:24,79
but we're mainly about setting up power
systems not about supplying appliances

80
00:06:24,79 --> 00:06:27,51
as well.

81
00:06:28,71 --> 00:06:32,08
What we usually recommend
to people is to have.

82
00:06:32,09 --> 00:06:33,80
They say lighting as much as possible

83
00:06:35,69 --> 00:06:39,06
and use they say appliances
wherever possible

84
00:06:39,06 --> 00:06:43,90
but we're they say appliances aren't
available then you'd probably just get your

85
00:06:43,90 --> 00:06:46,69
standard a c appliance and
run it via an inverter so.

86
00:06:46,90 --> 00:06:50,09
So then we want to make an
inverter available that

87
00:06:50,09 --> 00:06:57,60
that will give the minimum of problem
with running these appliances.

88
00:06:58,66 --> 00:07:01,52
We have had problems with they
say appliances in the past.

89
00:07:02,77 --> 00:07:04,56
Every once in a while we
come across a really good.

90
00:07:05,05 --> 00:07:08,50
12 out of appliance and
we start selling it

91
00:07:08,50 --> 00:07:12,54
and then six months a year down
the track. We discover that.

92
00:07:12,56 --> 00:07:15,65
The people that are doing
importing or manufacturing

93
00:07:15,65 --> 00:07:18,56
that particular appliance don't
feel this a big enough marketplace.

94
00:07:19,11 --> 00:07:20,47
They're not selling enough of a minute.

95
00:07:20,49 --> 00:07:22,10
Sorry to discontinue they
even though they were.

96
00:07:23,50 --> 00:07:28,96
We were doing really well with
them so. That's unfortunate but.

97
00:07:28,97 --> 00:07:35,89
I guess our power systems are
will be as dependable as what we

98
00:07:35,89 --> 00:07:40,13
are you know i don't see the companies
going to go down and there is always.

99
00:07:40,56 --> 00:07:43,07
It's actually quite
amazing. You know where.

100
00:07:44,30 --> 00:07:47,24
Other small businesses have
started in the forward.

101
00:07:47,25 --> 00:07:52,45
Probably 90 per cent of businesses a bit
in recent years they've started forward

102
00:07:52,46 --> 00:07:53,54
within a year or so.

103
00:07:55,16 --> 00:07:59,19
Here we are growing at a phenomenal rate
not seeing any end of the growth rate.

104
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,35
Goes on and so the way things are
looking i could say that the rain

105
00:08:05,35 --> 00:08:07,21
that i can hear and hear this day.

106
00:08:07,29 --> 00:08:08,55
You know we're going to get bigger

107
00:08:08,55 --> 00:08:15,46
and bigger as time goes on.

108
00:08:18,13 --> 00:08:23,59
Yeah yeah. It is an anarchistic i guess.

109
00:08:24,35 --> 00:08:30,34
I mean. It's interesting the word energy
is often seen to main total chaos.

110
00:08:30,81 --> 00:08:32,03
You know but yet.

111
00:08:33,55 --> 00:08:34,99
If you look at the way we're running here

112
00:08:34,99 --> 00:08:40,13
or even though there were either all shapes
are all indians nobody really knows was.

113
00:08:41,57 --> 00:08:44,88
We've got a working relationship
here that really does work.

114
00:08:45,10 --> 00:08:51,67
You know we we all know who to see about
what and who to communicate with and.

115
00:08:52,32 --> 00:08:54,54
It all seems to happen
next. Exceptionally well.

116
00:08:56,69 --> 00:09:00,21
As i was saying we've got
a structure whereby.

117
00:09:01,01 --> 00:09:03,52
We don't have a that
pyramid structure at all.

118
00:09:04,90 --> 00:09:08,10
Everybody's on the same level
we all learn the same wage.

119
00:09:09,46 --> 00:09:16,44
No matter what you do we all
have an equal opportunity

120
00:09:16,44 --> 00:09:22,07
in having some say in what goes
on in the company. So i guess.

121
00:09:22,61 --> 00:09:27,92
I guess one of the things that
makes it work is the fact that.

122
00:09:28,94 --> 00:09:31,64
We all are left with the responsibility.

123
00:09:31,73 --> 00:09:35,38
Each one of this is got the responsibility
you know it's not be can't pass

124
00:09:35,38 --> 00:09:39,46
responsibility onto somebody else. We all.

125
00:09:39,55 --> 00:09:41,31
I guess take their children that each

126
00:09:41,31 --> 00:09:43,10
and every one of this is
a bit like a foreman.

127
00:09:43,14 --> 00:09:45,59
You know we've got to make sure the job
is done and the job is done properly

128
00:09:47,12 --> 00:09:48,87
and the fact that we.

129
00:09:48,89 --> 00:09:53,71
Wear your shareholders we are all part
owners of the company gives a very direct

130
00:09:53,71 --> 00:09:59,67
interest in what goes on with the company.

131
00:10:04,18 --> 00:10:10,42
Yes. Well i don't know.

132
00:10:11,60 --> 00:10:12,44
I guess we all.

133
00:10:13,02 --> 00:10:16,84
We're all really proud of the company you
know we all really like what we're doing

134
00:10:16,84 --> 00:10:21,47
we all we all have great
regard for each other.

135
00:10:26,16 --> 00:10:32,42
Things and again and.
But you know it's cut.

136
00:10:32,44 --> 00:10:35,38
It's out there. Can't you.

137
00:10:39,73 --> 00:10:45,87
Gives you question again. Well i
think we have an incentive here.

138
00:10:46,92 --> 00:10:49,82
You can say nobody's going
to get rich but i guess.

139
00:10:50,61 --> 00:10:52,54
Well or prosperous the
company prospers altogether.

140
00:10:52,95 --> 00:10:57,86
You know at the moment we're getting very
low wage rates just because we can't

141
00:10:57,86 --> 00:11:00,56
afford to increase wage rates as yet
but hopefully in a near future.

142
00:11:00,85 --> 00:11:01,87
We'll be able to increase it.

143
00:11:01,90 --> 00:11:06,51
And as a company prospers our wage
rates of an increase in altogether.

144
00:11:07,33 --> 00:11:09,34
The fact that we know

145
00:11:09,34 --> 00:11:14,71
that there's not not somebody amongst us
who is making enormous amount of profits

146
00:11:14,71 --> 00:11:18,37
on.

147
00:11:19,48 --> 00:11:22,68
Sacrificing everybody else makes us
feel much happier you know we know

148
00:11:22,68 --> 00:11:23,67
that we're all equal.

149
00:11:25,17 --> 00:11:31,79
And it's quite amazing how we roll.

150
00:11:32,84 --> 00:11:39,09
And the level of commitment within the
company is actually quite astounding.

151
00:11:40,82 --> 00:11:44,99
You know if you look at other companies
and you look at the staff turnover.

152
00:11:45,01 --> 00:11:50,97
We've been going for for four years and
their staff turnover is incredibly low.

153
00:11:51,05 --> 00:11:55,08
You know most people that come
and join us here this day.

154
00:11:55,28 --> 00:11:59,45
You know they're happy here and not
really keen to move on. Anywhere else.

155
00:12:00,80 --> 00:12:05,15
I know for myself that i've worked
at all sorts of jobs in my life

156
00:12:06,03 --> 00:12:06,91
and most those jobs.

157
00:12:06,94 --> 00:12:09,65
I didn't really want to know i
wasn't happy with them you know

158
00:12:09,65 --> 00:12:14,44
and pattaya the reason for not being
happy with those jobs because they were

159
00:12:14,44 --> 00:12:18,20
damaging to the environment and the
fact that i knew i was doing a job

160
00:12:18,20 --> 00:12:20,55
that was destructive
didn't make me feel good.

161
00:12:20,76 --> 00:12:23,24
You know and the fact that
i was working for a boss

162
00:12:23,24 --> 00:12:29,67
and i didn't have to have any chance
of steering the company in different

163
00:12:29,67 --> 00:12:29,88
directions

164
00:12:29,88 --> 00:12:34,42
or anything just made me lose interest in
it you know whereas i think the way we've

165
00:12:34,42 --> 00:12:36,33
set up this company here.

166
00:12:36,34 --> 00:12:41,85
There's every incentive for people
to speak up to be involved.

167
00:12:41,86 --> 00:12:47,39
People can feel good about it because
because we're doing something

168
00:12:47,39 --> 00:12:52,41
that we believe is good for the environment
we're about setting about creating

169
00:12:52,41 --> 00:12:59,41
change in public awareness and
creating change in. Stand.

170
00:12:59,47 --> 00:13:03,93
Well i was going to talk
about standards of living.

171
00:13:05,89 --> 00:13:07,43
Creating a change in the lifestyle.

172
00:13:07,46 --> 00:13:09,43
You know the thing about
standard of living is

173
00:13:09,43 --> 00:13:16,41
that it's often quite meaningless you
know what really matters to us is

174
00:13:16,41 --> 00:13:21,87
quality of life. You know the
fact that that you've got.

175
00:13:21,89 --> 00:13:25,72
Toilet paper with with pretty
flowers printed on it you know.

176
00:13:26,63 --> 00:13:29,30
Does not improve one's quality of life but

177
00:13:29,30 --> 00:13:33,92
that is saying to improve the standard
of living you know the idea of stand of

178
00:13:33,92 --> 00:13:42,00
living is quite nonsensical.

179
00:13:42,74 --> 00:13:47,36
I think my quality of life
is probably very high.

180
00:13:48,03 --> 00:13:53,26
I mean i don't know nobody is going around
sort of comparing people's quality of

181
00:13:53,26 --> 00:13:54,19
life that i know of

182
00:13:54,19 --> 00:13:57,80
but although there is a lot of study
being done on standard of living

183
00:13:57,80 --> 00:13:59,91
and standards of living a based in time.

184
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:04,01
All the on profit in turn over no that's
still the stuff it doesn't you know people

185
00:14:04,01 --> 00:14:05,81
can be totally miserable.

186
00:14:07,06 --> 00:14:09,04
Caught up in a rat race
doing a job they don't like

187
00:14:09,79 --> 00:14:12,90
and yet their standard of living
could be seen to be very high.

188
00:14:12,93 --> 00:14:15,42
You know but but their quality
of life is just down the drain.

189
00:14:17,64 --> 00:14:21,85
And the way that that we are
here i think that we're all.

190
00:14:22,24 --> 00:14:24,45
As i was saying before
we don't earn very much.

191
00:14:25,45 --> 00:14:27,86
But we're living in a rural environment.

192
00:14:28,16 --> 00:14:33,58
With we've got clean air
fresh water around us.

193
00:14:33,60 --> 00:14:36,53
Beautiful views.

194
00:14:36,55 --> 00:14:43,44
We can do what we want we've all free
individuals we are not working on the buses.

195
00:14:44,65 --> 00:14:46,24
We're getting basically what we need.

196
00:14:46,48 --> 00:14:50,06
And i think that makes our quality
of life very high. You know.

197
00:14:50,38 --> 00:15:02,60
Even though there is something much
a stand of living is not so high.

198
00:15:02,62 --> 00:15:06,28
Yeah. As you can see we've got
power lines only 50 meters away.

199
00:15:06,48 --> 00:15:10,67
We decided when we don't. This place that.

200
00:15:11,78 --> 00:15:14,26
This is around new ram
attack on any premises.

201
00:15:15,57 --> 00:15:20,15
That way we were not going
to connect to the grid.

202
00:15:21,02 --> 00:15:24,09
And we were going to provide
all our own power for it.

203
00:15:25,05 --> 00:15:28,98
And that is done by way of about
50 solar panels on the roof.

204
00:15:29,52 --> 00:15:31,33
And then winter going out the back

205
00:15:32,11 --> 00:15:38,96
and the standby generator if neither
of those work very well. Is that.

206
00:15:39,49 --> 00:15:44,38
This building is also incorporating
passive solar design.

207
00:15:44,40 --> 00:15:50,50
And we've got most of the glass facing
north being in the southern hemisphere the

208
00:15:50,50 --> 00:15:54,93
sunshine gin. You know from the north.

209
00:15:54,95 --> 00:15:59,78
We've got eaves over all these
wind is calculated to let the sun.

210
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,93
Oh and then over the winter months but to
keep the sand out over the summer months.

211
00:16:06,33 --> 00:16:08,97
The building as a space story ended.

212
00:16:10,02 --> 00:16:17,01
So that. Yeah we've got a lot of
thermal mass in the building.

213
00:16:17,01 --> 00:16:20,82
We've got that. 600 tons of
mud brick in the building.

214
00:16:20,82 --> 00:16:23,50
I think and concrete floors that

215
00:16:23,50 --> 00:16:25,85
when the sand penetrates into the
building over the winter months.

216
00:16:27,52 --> 00:16:28,94
All that thermal mass heats up

217
00:16:28,94 --> 00:16:31,42
and maintains its heat for
a long period of time so

218
00:16:31,42 --> 00:16:34,53
that the building tends to retain
its heat over the winter months.

219
00:16:34,91 --> 00:16:36,15
Over the summer months.

220
00:16:36,37 --> 00:16:40,54
The sun doesn't shine in so all this
ever mistake is relatively cool and

221
00:16:42,14 --> 00:16:46,99
and keeps a fairly constant cool temperature
over the summer months we've also got

222
00:16:46,99 --> 00:16:53,29
a fairly high roof in the building which
allows us to to utilize to some extent.

223
00:16:54,48 --> 00:16:59,87
What you call the chimney effect as
fake you know thermal updrafts and.

224
00:16:59,89 --> 00:17:00,17
So

225
00:17:00,17 --> 00:17:05,33
that it's possible to open up there is of the
building where the cool air can be allowed

226
00:17:05,33 --> 00:17:11,17
in and as the air heats up. It moves out
through through the vents in the roof.

227
00:17:11,18 --> 00:17:16,23
Those vents in the roof can be closed
off. So that in the winter months.

228
00:17:16,53 --> 00:17:19,47
You can maintain heat within the
building in the summer months.

229
00:17:19,71 --> 00:17:24,45
You can just allow the airflow
to keep building cool.

230
00:17:24,78 --> 00:17:30,05
We've got a i think you've seen the.

231
00:17:31,66 --> 00:17:32,34
Courtyard.

232
00:17:32,50 --> 00:17:35,89
We've got a courtyard within the building
totally surrounded by the building which

233
00:17:35,89 --> 00:17:37,02
is got no roof over it.

234
00:17:37,06 --> 00:17:39,84
So it's an open area but
within the building and

235
00:17:39,85 --> 00:17:43,65
that helps to let more light into the
building because of the size of the building

236
00:17:43,65 --> 00:17:58,29
and it also allows us to ventilate
the building more adequately.

237
00:18:05,30 --> 00:18:12,92
Name been this scene as the the
alternative capital of australia.

238
00:18:12,94 --> 00:18:17,67
I think niman is a very
unique place and name

239
00:18:17,67 --> 00:18:22,64
and uniqueness is lended itself to setting
up the room but the company here.

240
00:18:25,05 --> 00:18:28,38
A lot more successfully than we could
have done anywhere else in the country.

241
00:18:28,40 --> 00:18:31,71
Nimbin is famous for being
famous. So to speak.

242
00:18:32,01 --> 00:18:37,85
You know we keep getting media
being attracted here all the time

243
00:18:37,85 --> 00:18:41,94
and most of the time they have to the
forgotten why they're coming here but it's.

244
00:18:42,46 --> 00:18:44,96
Just keep coming here.

245
00:18:46,48 --> 00:18:52,36
And i think that that has helped
us to a great extent you know.

246
00:18:52,38 --> 00:18:59,26
We've got in this area we have a lot
of really committed people people with

247
00:18:59,26 --> 00:19:01,85
great environmental awareness.

248
00:19:02,72 --> 00:19:06,75
And people who are really keen
on trying out new experiments.

249
00:19:07,23 --> 00:19:08,15
I think

250
00:19:08,15 --> 00:19:13,28
that looking for people with those qualities
elsewhere in the country would be a

251
00:19:13,28 --> 00:19:20,07
lot had an image in your
area. We've got every.

252
00:19:21,84 --> 00:19:24,87
You call skill they can possibly think of.

253
00:19:26,44 --> 00:19:32,74
Within a 20 mile radius of nimbin so with
every skill you can think of you probably

254
00:19:32,74 --> 00:19:35,58
don't have to go very far to find it you
know i know people around here that

255
00:19:35,58 --> 00:19:37,88
that were a nuclear
physicist etc. You know.

256
00:19:39,06 --> 00:19:40,06
I just didn't want to be part of

257
00:19:40,06 --> 00:19:43,31
that anymore so i decided to
come to nimbin so so i think

258
00:19:43,31 --> 00:19:47,62
that nimbin does attract
the kind of people that

259
00:19:47,62 --> 00:19:59,35
that helps to make the rain
with their company work.

260
00:20:01,66 --> 00:20:05,15
Yeah. Yeah there is definitely. Yeah yeah.

261
00:20:05,16 --> 00:20:09,75
Nimbin again niman is very
unusual in so many respects.

262
00:20:09,76 --> 00:20:13,89
Even though they say we're in
a site here that's not all

263
00:20:13,89 --> 00:20:19,55
that good for for installation
for for solar power. Yes.

264
00:20:19,64 --> 00:20:24,56
Nimbin as cut probably out of all the
residents no more than 50 per cent of them

265
00:20:25,35 --> 00:20:27,77
are living on their own
standalone power systems

266
00:20:27,77 --> 00:20:31,94
and most of those living on
entirely solar power systems.

267
00:20:32,03 --> 00:20:38,59
So there's a very strong
awareness in this area of

268
00:20:38,59 --> 00:20:41,14
environmental issues in a lot of people

269
00:20:41,14 --> 00:20:48,42
that move here do not want
to know about grid power.

270
00:20:49,26 --> 00:20:52,73
Also people who do not want
to know about about standard.

271
00:20:53,96 --> 00:20:57,72
Water carrier siri systems know sort of
stuff we've had a great dispute nimbleness

272
00:20:57,72 --> 00:21:00,78
recently over the the nimbin
syringe scheme. You know.

273
00:21:01,47 --> 00:21:08,01
The a lot of the townsfolk wanted it.
Very much. I think through ignorance.

274
00:21:08,38 --> 00:21:11,25
You know because.

275
00:21:11,27 --> 00:21:14,90
If anything the syringe system because it's
only been around for 100 years you know

276
00:21:14,90 --> 00:21:17,68
there were to carry it up
serious system but yet this day

277
00:21:17,68 --> 00:21:18,94
and age it's taken for granted.

278
00:21:19,36 --> 00:21:19,53
You know

279
00:21:19,53 --> 00:21:24,97
that if you want a serious system with a
carry serious system is the only way to go.

280
00:21:24,99 --> 00:21:29,86
And unfortunately in australia it's been
very few towns set up with any anything

281
00:21:29,86 --> 00:21:33,17
else. So there's no other
example for people to turn to.

282
00:21:33,25 --> 00:21:37,86
So when when there was
a lot of talk in them

283
00:21:37,86 --> 00:21:41,10
and about us having a serious system here.

284
00:21:42,27 --> 00:21:47,12
So many people said are you ok i will
carry serious justin because that's what

285
00:21:47,12 --> 00:21:50,90
everybody immediately thinks of.

286
00:21:51,98 --> 00:21:54,32
So well.

287
00:21:54,40 --> 00:21:59,90
A lot of the the alternative type
people do not live in the town she.

288
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:01,63
If they live in the surrounding areas

289
00:22:01,63 --> 00:22:08,15
and most of these people do not like
to see a water carrier syringe system.

290
00:22:08,27 --> 00:22:08,45
You know

291
00:22:08,45 --> 00:22:12,89
and particularly now we've been hearing
so much lately about blue green algae

292
00:22:12,89 --> 00:22:18,46
pollution of river systems and ocean
pollution through asian outflows

293
00:22:18,46 --> 00:22:19,50
and that's the stuff.

294
00:22:20,82 --> 00:22:25,88
And also you have a stray is
generally a very dry continent

295
00:22:26,62 --> 00:22:30,09
and just seems crazy that out
of our top quality water

296
00:22:30,09 --> 00:22:36,42
that we should be flushing 35 to 50 per
cent of it down the dunny you know.

297
00:22:36,44 --> 00:22:37,45
We're here at the rain

298
00:22:37,45 --> 00:22:41,65
but our company we decided to
go for a dry composting toilet.

299
00:22:41,97 --> 00:22:44,69
You know so you're not you're
not flushing the dunny at all.

300
00:22:44,74 --> 00:22:47,15
There's no water involved in the process.

301
00:22:48,26 --> 00:22:50,92
We also have a self-sufficient
with water here.

302
00:22:51,30 --> 00:22:53,35
We all there was a
requirement for the room

303
00:22:53,35 --> 00:22:54,91
but the company collected
off the roof here.

304
00:22:55,14 --> 00:23:02,13
We don't do not connect to the nimbin
water supply system. But anyway.

305
00:23:02,20 --> 00:23:03,91
Going back to those talking about.

306
00:23:03,94 --> 00:23:08,67
The with with the syringe
system in them and i think

307
00:23:08,67 --> 00:23:14,08
that there were other options
there and particularly one option

308
00:23:14,08 --> 00:23:18,19
that would have been very very much cheaper
to this syringe game that's now going

309
00:23:18,19 --> 00:23:23,30
into serious games costing about three
million dollars. We could have put in.

310
00:23:25,19 --> 00:23:31,24
Dry compress posting to this nature
home. For a fraction of that cost.

311
00:23:31,26 --> 00:23:37,88
And then of course no further.
Bills or anything down the line.

312
00:23:37,97 --> 00:23:42,72
Other than just just a small
collection say you know i think

313
00:23:42,72 --> 00:23:45,47
that every six months possibly
an employee of their own

314
00:23:45,47 --> 00:23:51,03
but our company even could have just gone
around and emptied the field containers.

315
00:23:51,22 --> 00:23:56,80
You know the thing about dry composting
toilets is what comes out of them is not in

316
00:23:56,81 --> 00:23:59,89
any way unpleasant. It's what.

317
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,62
Comes out it is actually
a very rich soft soil.

318
00:24:04,83 --> 00:24:10,03
You know humus it's it's it's a very
crumbly soft soil it's it's actually.

319
00:24:11,57 --> 00:24:18,02
It's no different to. The best so
that you find in the garden anywhere.

320
00:24:18,10 --> 00:24:20,98
You know so. If you wait.

321
00:24:21,02 --> 00:24:26,67
If you've got a dry compassing toilet itself
to decay for at least nine months then

322
00:24:26,67 --> 00:24:29,97
then what you've got to deal with there
is actually a very valuable commodity.

323
00:24:30,54 --> 00:24:33,94
It's actually a saleable commodity
price whereas what we're doing now.

324
00:24:35,94 --> 00:24:42,52
I'm not sure whether we're thinking
about trying to sell the byproduct.

325
00:24:43,15 --> 00:24:46,88
But the problem is with standard
always carries syringe systems is

326
00:24:46,88 --> 00:24:52,64
that the byproduct is still likely to
be contaminated with all sorts of human

327
00:24:52,64 --> 00:24:55,44
passage and. Whereas with
a dry composting toilet.

328
00:24:56,28 --> 00:25:00,39
Every human pathogen other than possibly
around we're makes has been destroyed in

329
00:25:00,39 --> 00:25:03,00
the process. So there's nothing

330
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:08,12
that compares with with
with composting for for.

331
00:25:08,14 --> 00:25:09,38
Getting rid of passage

332
00:25:09,38 --> 00:25:19,49
and if you get frustrated.

333
00:25:22,58 --> 00:25:29,28
Like. You know.

334
00:25:31,81 --> 00:25:33,00
You know.

335
00:25:35,92 --> 00:25:42,10
Well if you ask around and
about as a success story.

336
00:25:43,37 --> 00:25:44,80
I think everybody would point to the rain

337
00:25:44,80 --> 00:25:49,28
that our company first thing
you know so i think that.

338
00:25:49,29 --> 00:25:55,47
There are things happening around them
and that everybody is proud of the way

339
00:25:55,47 --> 00:25:58,99
that i feel about things i've i've had
this feeling for a long long time.

340
00:25:59,26 --> 00:26:02,63
I remember when i was. As a
teenager or in my early 20s

341
00:26:02,63 --> 00:26:07,37
and seeing all these demonstrations
around the place you know anti vietnam

342
00:26:07,37 --> 00:26:09,20
demonstrations of this stuff.

343
00:26:09,60 --> 00:26:12,63
And all these demonstrations
to me seemed to be wrong.

344
00:26:14,38 --> 00:26:17,84
They seem to be throwing
aggression at violence.

345
00:26:18,08 --> 00:26:25,22
You know throwing more violence
in the direction of violence.

346
00:26:25,24 --> 00:26:27,45
To me if you wanted to
demonstrate something.

347
00:26:27,67 --> 00:26:33,98
What you want to be demonstrating is how
to do it not how not to do with you know

348
00:26:33,98 --> 00:26:37,65
so i guess that's what my life has been
all about you know i've always wanted to

349
00:26:37,65 --> 00:26:39,42
demonstrate the positive not the negative.

350
00:26:40,22 --> 00:26:43,05
So the rain but our company
is an example of that.

351
00:26:44,49 --> 00:26:44,78
I think

352
00:26:44,78 --> 00:26:50,11
that we're through here trying to demonstrate
not necessarily what's wrong with how

353
00:26:50,11 --> 00:26:55,17
everybody else is doing it.
But how to do it correctly.

354
00:26:55,98 --> 00:27:01,13
And i think that you know nimbin
it's got all sorts of positive

355
00:27:01,13 --> 00:27:02,35
and negative aspects to it.

356
00:27:04,28 --> 00:27:06,05
But i'd like to focus more on the positive

357
00:27:06,05 --> 00:27:10,79
and not take so much
notice of the negative.

358
00:27:10,81 --> 00:27:15,55
Hence our address yeah
one alternative way.

359
00:27:16,26 --> 00:27:23,17
We had a straight here didn't have a name
to it so decide to give their own. Etc..
