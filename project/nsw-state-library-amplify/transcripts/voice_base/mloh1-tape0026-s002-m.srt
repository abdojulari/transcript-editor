1
00:00:03,82 --> 00:00:09,68
He said you can tackle with us. Read. Well
i brought in my four shilling and ten

2
00:00:09,68 --> 00:00:16,03
punny russian and used to
put it on the table and.

3
00:00:16,95 --> 00:00:23,90
I. I got some employment. They called
it real leaf work and that job was only

4
00:00:23,90 --> 00:00:30,20
in centennial park. They were draining
the ponds the duck ponds down there

5
00:00:31,36 --> 00:00:36,23
and these ponds were gravitated from
a higher level to a lower and by

6
00:00:36,23 --> 00:00:41,56
a system of good drainage they got the water
out of some of them and they set these

7
00:00:41,56 --> 00:00:47,42
relief workers to work with barrow and
shovel and planks and so forth and our

8
00:00:47,42 --> 00:00:52,84
object was to dig out the mud in the bottom
of the duck ponds and shovel it into

9
00:00:52,84 --> 00:00:57,29
the burrows and push the barrow up the
planks and tip it on the perimeter of the

10
00:00:57,29 --> 00:01:00,23
pond. Well i worked there
as a relief worker for

11
00:01:00,23 --> 00:01:07,16
a time. And then. How many days.
How many weeks in on and off did

12
00:01:07,16 --> 00:01:13,43
you get. If my memory serves me correctly

13
00:01:16,60 --> 00:01:20,67
it was a few days for a single man but

14
00:01:20,68 --> 00:01:26,80
a married man with children. He was given
more consideration. And he was one in one

15
00:01:26,80 --> 00:01:29,69
stage it was one in five and that's another
one in four i would just wondering.

16
00:01:29,71 --> 00:01:31,65
That's one week on and for week after

17
00:01:31,65 --> 00:01:35,90
a single man i don't know how many you
know there is so long ago. I have

18
00:01:35,90 --> 00:01:42,44
a faint remembrance of the actual
time but i will add to that. That

19
00:01:43,66 --> 00:01:50,54
one day my mate told me that the
department of main roads board words could

20
00:01:50,54 --> 00:01:56,94
work calling for men up at the local
labour exchange at charring cross waverley

21
00:01:57,96 --> 00:02:02,64
and that they were offered was up
on the queensland border. It was

22
00:02:02,64 --> 00:02:08,80
a single man's job thirty hours a week
two pounds two showings and sixpence

23
00:02:09,63 --> 00:02:16,40
a week. Well i went forward and
i didn't hesitate to register

24
00:02:16,41 --> 00:02:23,24
for such employment. Well
they the department of main

25
00:02:23,24 --> 00:02:26,30
roads board commissioned a
couple of courage is on

26
00:02:26,30 --> 00:02:32,97
a train and when we recruits assembled
at central railway station as

27
00:02:32,97 --> 00:02:33,23
a quite

28
00:02:33,23 --> 00:02:39,100
a number of us to fill those two carriages
and the way we were transported up

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:46,98
to tenterfield and some
of the hardheads in

30
00:02:46,99 --> 00:02:53,85
the assembly of men when they were
informed that the work was sixty miles

31
00:02:53,85 --> 00:02:59,34
out of tenterfield on the tender field to
brisbane highway these hard heads is not

32
00:02:59,34 --> 00:03:05,92
for us. We'll get the next train back so
they they camped they slept around the

33
00:03:05,92 --> 00:03:11,54
railway station that night and they got
the next train back the next day but some

34
00:03:11,54 --> 00:03:17,98
of us that were more discreet
we accepted the future

35
00:03:18,67 --> 00:03:24,27
and we were transported out
to the camp the camp is

36
00:03:24,27 --> 00:03:31,16
a famous place up in that part of
the state called. Core rela core

37
00:03:31,17 --> 00:03:37,53
realer and the actual section of the road
was being constructed by the department

38
00:03:37,53 --> 00:03:43,83
of main roads board was
between oak creek and.

39
00:03:44,63 --> 00:03:51,35
Well i settled in there they department a
main road war board main roads board had

40
00:03:51,35 --> 00:03:56,95
a very good camp set up for
us and we all moved in and.

41
00:03:58,34 --> 00:04:04,24
My health began to improve noticeably
because i had been semi starved

42
00:04:05,48 --> 00:04:07,94
on a fallen tenpenny dole in the city over

43
00:04:07,94 --> 00:04:14,83
a period of eighteen months and my health
began to pick up quickly and i settled

44
00:04:14,83 --> 00:04:20,79
in intent to save money. What sort of work
to do you do on the road. Well the work

45
00:04:20,79 --> 00:04:26,70
consisted of shoveling shoveling into

46
00:04:26,70 --> 00:04:33,67
a fleet of trucks that used to back in on
us in the gravel pit. We used to shovel

47
00:04:33,67 --> 00:04:38,52
this gravel up into the trucks and the
trucks would distribute the gravel along the

48
00:04:38,52 --> 00:04:44,84
newly formed road and incidentally it
was iron stone gravel. It was alluvial

49
00:04:45,57 --> 00:04:52,01
it used to be plowed out of the hillside
by the men on the plows and it was

50
00:04:52,01 --> 00:04:58,19
a readily available material that didn't
cost very much at all and it didn't have

51
00:04:58,19 --> 00:05:00,52
to be napped or spaulding no it was it was

52
00:05:00,52 --> 00:05:06,29
a natural deposit of ironstone and when it
was spread over the newly formed road it

53
00:05:06,29 --> 00:05:12,96
made an ideal surface. Can i take you
back to the quarry. Do you remember

54
00:05:13,93 --> 00:05:16,79
the conditions at the quarry and the
working conditions generally from

55
00:05:16,79 --> 00:05:23,42
a physical point of view. Indeed i do.
And i have often referred to it as the

56
00:05:23,42 --> 00:05:27,93
nearest approach to slavery
that i knew. And without

57
00:05:27,93 --> 00:05:30,44
a doubt. Now ground it is

58
00:05:30,44 --> 00:05:36,47
a very refractory material
to work sandstone is

59
00:05:36,47 --> 00:05:42,52
a child's play in comparison and the

60
00:05:42,52 --> 00:05:45,60
scotchman that were brought out on

61
00:05:45,60 --> 00:05:51,67
a five year contract to process granite
were men that were hardened to it. And

62
00:05:52,71 --> 00:05:58,66
they used to point out to our boys the
necessity of throwing the weight of the body

63
00:05:58,66 --> 00:06:04,36
in with the blow you didn't just tapped you
didn't just tap the tool you lift your

64
00:06:04,36 --> 00:06:11,28
four pound how much head high and you
struck with all your might. Onto

65
00:06:11,29 --> 00:06:17,18
the head of that punch and hence the arduous
nature of the work. Well to see these

66
00:06:17,18 --> 00:06:22,19
got you and many of them passed middle
aged laboring the way they used to do and

67
00:06:22,20 --> 00:06:29,18
getting the results they did spoke volumes
for them. I'd like now to refer to the

68
00:06:30,16 --> 00:06:36,85
key men the key men that were
engaged. To make it possible for the

69
00:06:36,85 --> 00:06:41,96
pylons to be constructed they were
the tools shop. Ps tool shop is

70
00:06:41,96 --> 00:06:42,93
a very special man

71
00:06:42,93 --> 00:06:49,35
a very very special man and
his art is to draw out and

72
00:06:49,35 --> 00:06:54,91
temper. The punch points in such

73
00:06:54,91 --> 00:07:01,19
a way that those points would not snapped.
They would not snap and there were only

74
00:07:01,19 --> 00:07:06,40
about six or eight of these men and they
were key men and i don't mind stating that

75
00:07:06,41 --> 00:07:12,12
the pylons of sydney harbour bridge would
never have been constructed without those

76
00:07:12,12 --> 00:07:14,38
eight men with

77
00:07:14,38 --> 00:07:20,75
a scots australians or talent. Most of
them were scotch one man in particular the

78
00:07:20,75 --> 00:07:27,42
foreman mackenzie mckenzie was his
name and mckinsey used to boast

79
00:07:29,01 --> 00:07:35,25
and say he used to say have you ever
show up. Have you ever shopped for the

80
00:07:35,25 --> 00:07:38,45
brunswick black. That was

81
00:07:38,45 --> 00:07:44,45
a particularly hard. Type of granite to be
found in scotland and any man that could

82
00:07:44,45 --> 00:07:47,37
shop successfully for
the brunswick black was

83
00:07:47,37 --> 00:07:53,84
a highly skilled tool shop.
What did that was that

84
00:07:53,84 --> 00:08:00,78
a lot lot harder than the america and
it extremely hard it was like it was it

85
00:08:00,78 --> 00:08:00,96
had

86
00:08:00,96 --> 00:08:07,82
a carbon content in it which makes
it as black as this instrument

87
00:08:07,82 --> 00:08:14,43
here. Black the tool sharps what
sort of machines. They use.

88
00:08:15,42 --> 00:08:22,11
It was it was hand work. The
punches and the chisels pneumatic

89
00:08:22,12 --> 00:08:28,27
chisels and hand chisels and punches and
the four points are all done by hand

90
00:08:29,44 --> 00:08:35,11
ground. Now all drawn out on the
envoy and done by hand and tempered.

91
00:08:37,17 --> 00:08:38,47
I understand. So it's

92
00:08:38,47 --> 00:08:43,29
a special steel which is drawn out on the
anvil and then tempered afterwards. Yes

93
00:08:43,29 --> 00:08:50,00
indeed the carbon carbon content
of the steel was high and it was

94
00:08:50,00 --> 00:08:56,67
necessary in order for the tool to be durable
went in the special steels that there

95
00:08:56,67 --> 00:09:03,06
are now for that sort of job. Well i
don't think not to the same extent but

96
00:09:03,77 --> 00:09:09,86
normal and long you know i
knew the right type of steel

97
00:09:10,69 --> 00:09:14,71
to see the job through you know what
sort of steel. It was no i can't name it

98
00:09:14,71 --> 00:09:20,44
wasn't tungsten carbide oh oh now that's

99
00:09:20,44 --> 00:09:27,25
a bit technical for me it could have been
very well do you remember in the working

100
00:09:27,25 --> 00:09:31,68
conditions there were there was there any
was there anything to extract the dust.

101
00:09:32,08 --> 00:09:38,89
No indeed. Now that that was what
caused me to become discontented in

102
00:09:38,89 --> 00:09:45,63
myself because. Let dust in
the shed was so pro furious

103
00:09:46,45 --> 00:09:47,74
that you couldn't distinguish

104
00:09:49,18 --> 00:09:55,21
a person say twenty five yards from you
you couldn't distinction distinguish who

105
00:09:55,22 --> 00:10:02,12
that person was especially when the sun's
rays. Came in through the shed. And

106
00:10:02,13 --> 00:10:08,68
made it even more impossible to do it.
Determine who was who. Well this vaporized

107
00:10:08,68 --> 00:10:15,27
dust. We inhaled it. And furthermore
the dust created by the pneumatic

108
00:10:15,27 --> 00:10:22,12
tool was even worse because you
had to get close to your work to

109
00:10:22,12 --> 00:10:25,84
see that you weren't braking and
to see that you were getting

110
00:10:25,84 --> 00:10:29,45
a down to the right level and so forth and
that dust coming away from the pneumatic

111
00:10:29,45 --> 00:10:36,13
tool. You couldn't avoid it. Did
you use any goggles or any yes we

112
00:10:36,96 --> 00:10:43,47
in order to it was imperative. It was
imperative that every man wore the goggles

113
00:10:43,47 --> 00:10:50,38
supplied by the company. Because
the particles of granite that

114
00:10:50,38 --> 00:10:56,81
used to fly were extremely
dangerous and it amazes me

115
00:10:56,81 --> 00:11:01,69
to think that there were not. Eyes.

116
00:11:03,73 --> 00:11:09,87
Well ruined by the flying granite. It
amazes me that they weren't and nobody were

117
00:11:09,87 --> 00:11:16,68
masks. No nobody nobody wore masks. They
weren't encouraged to do so because

118
00:11:18,57 --> 00:11:24,56
the carbonic acid gas that you reach out
from your lungs. You can't get rid of us

119
00:11:24,56 --> 00:11:30,17
sufficiently fast and you bring that
back in again and those masks were very

120
00:11:30,17 --> 00:11:36,08
unhygienic and unhealthy. We didn't use
them. Did you have any changing rooms at

121
00:11:36,08 --> 00:11:42,72
the quarry. No no. There are no such modern
amenities in those days we were dirty

122
00:11:42,72 --> 00:11:48,66
grubby characters but about the toilet
arrangements their toilet arrangements were

123
00:11:49,94 --> 00:11:56,93
up up to standard. There was no sewage
there was none whatsoever. So what was it

124
00:11:56,93 --> 00:12:03,31
pit or chemical. It was i

125
00:12:03,32 --> 00:12:10,04
think they were canisters that the
sanitary man used to take away.

126
00:12:10,06 --> 00:12:16,54
Do you remember how far you the quarry
was from the town and i would say.

127
00:12:19,59 --> 00:12:26,44
Do you remember the granite crashes to
you. Yes indeed the call was what we

128
00:12:26,44 --> 00:12:32,45
call the interior or cause of
the pylons consist of concrete.

129
00:12:32,89 --> 00:12:39,72
Now them material for the concreting of
those cause was crushed in meru. And

130
00:12:40,91 --> 00:12:42,63
the they set up

131
00:12:42,63 --> 00:12:49,61
a very large crusher with jaws of all the
jaws seem to be about three feet wide

132
00:12:51,32 --> 00:12:56,67
and the the granite. But this
crush i used to queue up

133
00:12:58,36 --> 00:13:02,87
used to be picked up off the floor of
the quarry by the crane and dropped on

134
00:13:02,87 --> 00:13:08,20
a platform adjacent to the jaws of this
crusher and the crusher man would bar them

135
00:13:08,20 --> 00:13:13,22
in the best he could into this crusher
and it was a or. Used to make

136
00:13:13,22 --> 00:13:15,92
a terroristic as

137
00:13:15,93 --> 00:13:20,41
a broke up these big plums. Well
those those plums reduced to

138
00:13:20,41 --> 00:13:25,33
a certain size would tumble
down into a skiff. Which was

139
00:13:25,33 --> 00:13:29,72
a. Before wield bucket
underneath there were quite

140
00:13:29,72 --> 00:13:33,05
a number of them perhaps six or
eight of them in one line like

141
00:13:33,05 --> 00:13:37,74
a minute. Your train and ours these buckets
were filled underneath this big crusher

142
00:13:39,05 --> 00:13:44,28
and the try and load was completed the
little rail motor would drag those crushing

143
00:13:44,28 --> 00:13:50,10
up to our and another crusher. Into which
they were tipped and this crusher would

144
00:13:50,10 --> 00:13:56,57
reduce them still finer. And from
the from the base of that crusher

145
00:13:57,75 --> 00:14:01,19
the crossings were elevated by

146
00:14:01,20 --> 00:14:04,93
a belt system with buckets
on it and tipped onto

147
00:14:04,93 --> 00:14:11,23
a rubber tipped into everything
now. Tipped into a grade

148
00:14:11,24 --> 00:14:13,40
a this grade a consisted of

149
00:14:13,40 --> 00:14:19,13
a great circumstance of steel. Say
about six or eight feet in diameter

150
00:14:20,09 --> 00:14:26,92
perforated with holes from end to end
and these holes graduated from large

151
00:14:26,92 --> 00:14:33,88
to gradually smaller at the end and
this greater rotated on the top of this

152
00:14:33,88 --> 00:14:38,84
big bin. So that when the ground. It was
tipped in it was more or less gradually

153
00:14:38,84 --> 00:14:45,38
graded into the several bins. Underneath
this greater and there it. Lied until

154
00:14:45,38 --> 00:14:51,80
the ships came in to take away the processed
granite as well as the crushing was

155
00:14:51,80 --> 00:14:56,46
now one and only boats came in and there
were several of them. If my memory serves

156
00:14:56,46 --> 00:15:03,45
me correctly they were the duty
bell by name the hue bell who was

157
00:15:03,45 --> 00:15:09,90
a senior official of the doorman and
long company in england. So hugely bell.

158
00:15:12,69 --> 00:15:19,50
In addition to sir hugh to bell
there was the doorman long.

159
00:15:19,52 --> 00:15:24,74
Sir dudley dick. These are three that
i can recall there was about half

160
00:15:24,74 --> 00:15:29,69
a dozen of them but these ships
were specially constructed with

161
00:15:29,70 --> 00:15:35,75
a minimum of a motor or
funnel at the back. And

162
00:15:35,75 --> 00:15:42,01
a very little poop in the front but most
of the ship was whole into this hole this

163
00:15:42,01 --> 00:15:44,86
crushed granite would be directed. From

164
00:15:44,86 --> 00:15:51,16
a belt. And when the hold was
sufficiently fooled by this ballast.

165
00:15:52,28 --> 00:15:58,58
The ship would move from that position
to the wharf proper and there was

166
00:15:58,58 --> 00:16:05,42
a sixty foot sixty foot
steel crane operated by jim

167
00:16:05,43 --> 00:16:10,55
kennedy and incidentally i'd like to comment
on this. Jim kennedy before this is

168
00:16:10,55 --> 00:16:17,21
concluded. Jim kind of the use
of operate the crane and these

169
00:16:17,22 --> 00:16:24,03
down as it were all tabulated
all marked with paint

170
00:16:25,21 --> 00:16:29,32
and so that there were a given as

171
00:16:29,32 --> 00:16:35,17
a given section of the pylon was picked
up stone by stone by jim kennedy and

172
00:16:35,17 --> 00:16:41,88
deposited in the hole of this ship.
On top of the crushed ballast. Now

173
00:16:41,88 --> 00:16:45,89
that was the process of getting the ballast
and the dimension stones to sidney.

174
00:16:46,42 --> 00:16:52,06
They have to pack the pack with
stones off before they sailed

175
00:16:54,73 --> 00:17:00,92
know now the stone or simply picked up
and lowered in on top of the ballast and

176
00:17:00,92 --> 00:17:04,88
stabilised by timber
between each stone but it

177
00:17:04,88 --> 00:17:08,38
a very good see you were the load for

178
00:17:08,38 --> 00:17:15,31
a ship to sail with to ember any of the
other crane drivers yes indeed. Yes

179
00:17:17,96 --> 00:17:18,20
campbell

180
00:17:19,32 --> 00:17:25,79
a young man named. Jock
campbell the other crane driver

181
00:17:26,68 --> 00:17:32,62
and i was the one in the quarry was
a no no. Jock. Campbell was in

182
00:17:32,62 --> 00:17:38,14
a crane adjacent adjacent to the one
operated by jim kennedy who was a young man

183
00:17:38,14 --> 00:17:44,94
a very responsible young scotsman very fiery
and so forth and but nevertheless the

184
00:17:44,94 --> 00:17:51,82
other cry and driver. What was out i have
mentioned several right joe separate

185
00:17:52,97 --> 00:17:58,18
he was the quarry driver. Yes he operated
the steam crane in the quarry that he

186
00:17:58,18 --> 00:18:04,36
managed to carry on after the death of of
waters at the back there. Yes yes. Yes of

187
00:18:04,36 --> 00:18:10,57
the game had to go on and i
may mention in passing that

188
00:18:11,53 --> 00:18:13,34
some of the original i would say about

189
00:18:13,34 --> 00:18:19,85
a dozen of the original masons that
arrived on the job. One of them

190
00:18:19,85 --> 00:18:26,50
was jimmy crewe shank jimmy
cruikshank and george walton

191
00:18:27,41 --> 00:18:34,12
and bob celeste's all. And jim kennedy

192
00:18:34,12 --> 00:18:40,57
mason jim kennedy and there were
several of these men got wind of this

193
00:18:40,57 --> 00:18:47,44
contract and they jumped into the breach
immediately. Do you remember the union

194
00:18:48,15 --> 00:18:51,80
and any air union activity down
the quarry. There was a there was

195
00:18:51,80 --> 00:18:59,31
a surprising. Continuity

196
00:19:00,94 --> 00:19:07,80
of work without interruption on the job
but. It was the stone masons you know was

197
00:19:07,80 --> 00:19:14,75
it. Yes yes there was the stone masons
union. I may mention that the stonemasons

198
00:19:14,75 --> 00:19:21,72
rate of pay in sydney was six pounds
ten. But for the country allowance in

199
00:19:21,72 --> 00:19:26,32
america. It brought it up to seven pounds
six and eightpence now that country our

200
00:19:26,32 --> 00:19:30,86
lands and i have heard it said and i have
been through the arbitration proceedings

201
00:19:30,86 --> 00:19:36,43
on this that one of the reasons that they
brought the scots stonemasons and the

202
00:19:36,43 --> 00:19:42,05
italians to masons out was to try and
break the agreement to pay that country

203
00:19:42,05 --> 00:19:47,53
announce. Well this is news
to me but i wouldn't be

204
00:19:47,53 --> 00:19:54,24
a bit surprised with all my due respect
for the scotchman you know it is often

205
00:19:55,80 --> 00:19:59,98
the scotsman is often referred
to as being a bit near etc. Etc.

206
00:19:59,98 --> 00:20:05,47
But that is entirely false of the scotch
people they are according to the studies i

207
00:20:05,47 --> 00:20:11,40
have made of burns. Robert burns and my
actual contact with them they are the most

208
00:20:12,12 --> 00:20:18,96
open hearted humane humanitarians that i
have ever had the pleasure of knowing i

209
00:20:18,97 --> 00:20:22,55
don't i'm not saying that they did scare
or anything like that. I know the country

210
00:20:22,55 --> 00:20:25,53
. Lance was paid but what
and has been alleged by

211
00:20:25,53 --> 00:20:30,61
a number of people is that doorman long
tried to avoid paying the country lands by

212
00:20:30,61 --> 00:20:35,63
importing these masons. Could the job have
been done without the scots masons know

213
00:20:37,12 --> 00:20:39,88
and that dominant long adopters such

214
00:20:39,88 --> 00:20:46,03
a procedure doesn't do them any credit
the credit lies with the scotchman

215
00:20:46,03 --> 00:20:48,63
these highly skilled men as

216
00:20:48,63 --> 00:20:53,88
a matter of fact they had to import them
because they didn't have the skilled labor

217
00:20:53,88 --> 00:20:57,63
here to do the job. Well that's what they
say that's what doorman long said but it

218
00:20:57,63 --> 00:21:01,39
was alleged by other people that they
imported them not to because they couldn't

219
00:21:01,39 --> 00:21:06,66
get local masons but because they wanted
to avoid paying the the country lands.

220
00:21:07,14 --> 00:21:08,04
Well that is

221
00:21:08,04 --> 00:21:13,51
a matter for conjecture conjecture but i
think myself. The fact remains that they

222
00:21:13,51 --> 00:21:17,69
didn't have the skill men in this country
to complete the contract. Well that's

223
00:21:17,69 --> 00:21:23,21
what dominates say. So we'll have to accept
that then. But the rumor went around

224
00:21:23,21 --> 00:21:23,91
and there is

225
00:21:23,91 --> 00:21:29,70
a certain well i know that as the men came
off the ships that the union signed them

226
00:21:29,70 --> 00:21:34,77
all up so that the country allowance was
paid you know. But the state what had

227
00:21:34,77 --> 00:21:40,63
happened was this that the doormen long
had forgotten to calculate the country

228
00:21:40,63 --> 00:21:45,72
allowance into the cost of their contract.
So they went back to the government and

229
00:21:45,72 --> 00:21:49,79
said well you're responsible for the rise
and fall in wages. What about paying us

230
00:21:49,79 --> 00:21:54,71
this and the government and bradfield said
no no no no that's that's our country

231
00:21:54,71 --> 00:21:58,25
allowance is not wages you should have put
that in the contract in the first place

232
00:21:59,01 --> 00:22:02,34
so they say well and that case we can we're
not gonna pay the country. The country

233
00:22:02,34 --> 00:22:05,46
allowance from the stonemasons unions that
well you've got to pay that the country

234
00:22:05,46 --> 00:22:10,82
lads at their round about that time the.
The men started coming in from scotland

235
00:22:10,82 --> 00:22:11,18
that is

236
00:22:11,18 --> 00:22:15,30
a live and the stand mason's union signed
them up so that the country lands was

237
00:22:15,30 --> 00:22:19,57
paid and one long lost out. So you know
that's the story as far as that's concerned

238
00:22:19,57 --> 00:22:23,55
but it was alleged that they actually
imported them to avoid paying the country

239
00:22:23,55 --> 00:22:27,93
lands but it seems that this is not so
and that what they said was that they

240
00:22:27,93 --> 00:22:33,04
couldn't get enough local mason so in
actual fact they did have to import them do

241
00:22:33,05 --> 00:22:38,04
you remember whether there was was used
amongst the labourers down there. Yes yes

242
00:22:38,04 --> 00:22:38,56
the a.w.

243
00:22:38,56 --> 00:22:45,28
Was well represented down
there and the men were well

244
00:22:45,28 --> 00:22:46,28
organized as

245
00:22:46,28 --> 00:22:52,89
a matter of fact my father being the
democrat that he was used to give the i

246
00:22:52,90 --> 00:22:56,31
w you. Organizer. What we called

247
00:22:56,31 --> 00:23:01,13
a shakedown for the night at our private
dwelling in the town. Do you remember the

248
00:23:01,13 --> 00:23:07,19
name of the organisers i can't recall his
name. But this was my first introduction

249
00:23:07,19 --> 00:23:14,13
to democratic thinking
because this man used to

250
00:23:14,13 --> 00:23:17,38
live live with my father the a.w.

251
00:23:17,38 --> 00:23:22,07
You paper called the worker
and that paper what edited by

252
00:23:23,02 --> 00:23:29,97
a famous philosopher in this country
an englishman. Henry the boot.

253
00:23:30,55 --> 00:23:37,53
He edited that paper for forty years of
his life. Yes. Now do you remember any

254
00:23:37,53 --> 00:23:43,32
of the job delegates shot or the shop
delegates. Yes there was one in particular

255
00:23:44,59 --> 00:23:47,29
he was an italian and he is

256
00:23:47,29 --> 00:23:54,02
a member of the moloch so moloko family
who have operated as masons in this city

257
00:23:54,02 --> 00:23:54,13
for

258
00:23:54,13 --> 00:23:59,40
a couple of generations. His name was
victor my locker. He spoke english fluently

259
00:24:00,14 --> 00:24:05,78
and whenever there was any disruption at
the quarry. Victor was brought forward to

260
00:24:07,11 --> 00:24:13,85
interpret to the italians the proceedings
of that meeting and whether italians

261
00:24:13,85 --> 00:24:15,21
member of the stand masons or the a.w.

262
00:24:16,14 --> 00:24:21,17
They were members of the stonemasons union.
Yes well that and so there was there

263
00:24:21,17 --> 00:24:21,25
was

264
00:24:21,25 --> 00:24:28,32
a unifil unified union front very
much so and factor since the

265
00:24:28,32 --> 00:24:29,65
scotchman were brought out on

266
00:24:29,65 --> 00:24:36,33
a five year contract. Namely that if they
remained. Until the completion of the

267
00:24:36,33 --> 00:24:43,31
contract that their fares would be paid
back home. Well presumably some of these

268
00:24:43,31 --> 00:24:47,35
are tallien came from north italy and they
were probably brought out under contract

269
00:24:47,35 --> 00:24:53,79
from italy. Did you see anything of
the scots being paid in gold. No

270
00:24:55,81 --> 00:25:01,62
i never set eyes on gold in all my lifetime.
Several people in sydney have said

271
00:25:01,62 --> 00:25:06,67
that the stonemasons were paid in gold.
That is utterly false. Well you know the

272
00:25:06,67 --> 00:25:10,43
story is that the that they used to come
the stand masons used to come up with the

273
00:25:10,43 --> 00:25:16,34
. Gold sovereigns and drink in the imperial
on notions point and that they would

274
00:25:16,34 --> 00:25:22,72
put the gold in the bar.
That is irresponsible

275
00:25:23,90 --> 00:25:29,68
thinking. Did you. Did you come across
any of the masons who worked in sydney.

276
00:25:33,23 --> 00:25:39,87
Yes yes and there's one in particular
that is worthy of comment and notice

277
00:25:40,66 --> 00:25:46,43
i worked with this man in the monumental
firm of arnold and company in paddington

278
00:25:47,25 --> 00:25:52,15
they have been established there for about
100 years. Well this amount i worked

279
00:25:52,15 --> 00:25:58,68
alongside of had worked in mariah his name
was william summers. Yes i would double

280
00:25:58,68 --> 00:25:59,08
m e

281
00:25:59,08 --> 00:26:06,49
r s william summers was one of the most
experienced and highly skilled and authentic

282
00:26:06,49 --> 00:26:12,99
men on the question of granite. Now
this man was so acknowledged that the

283
00:26:13,95 --> 00:26:19,27
the representatives of doormen and long
before they decided on the whereabouts of

284
00:26:19,27 --> 00:26:26,05
acquiring him. They selected
sometimes as being the authentic

285
00:26:26,05 --> 00:26:29,11
mason to advise them as to

286
00:26:29,12 --> 00:26:35,40
a location and the quality of granite.
Well some of us went down with the

287
00:26:36,30 --> 00:26:41,40
two or three of the executives. Presumably
they were engineers that didn't know

288
00:26:41,40 --> 00:26:47,77
much about granite and some of us went in
about into the hinterland behind maria

289
00:26:48,91 --> 00:26:54,57
up around nelligan way you told me and all
around there. But the location wasn't

290
00:26:54,57 --> 00:26:59,19
suitable and they ended up at maruja yes
but that was picked by bradfield from

291
00:26:59,19 --> 00:27:03,68
a number of public works quarry wasn't it.
But the maria quarry. I don't doubt that

292
00:27:03,68 --> 00:27:10,53
because the proximity the proximity of
the quarry to the actual river. You

293
00:27:10,53 --> 00:27:14,41
couldn't have bettered it anywhere in the
state. Yes i know that was one of the

294
00:27:14,41 --> 00:27:19,49
that when one of the reasons. Do you
ever hear or remember another one of the

295
00:27:19,49 --> 00:27:25,26
stonemasons who worked in sydney.
Tom mackay. Macaire that my client

296
00:27:25,26 --> 00:27:32,26
a very very ancient name. I

297
00:27:32,26 --> 00:27:37,23
know about was familiar with mackay he
didn't work at murray. Incidentally he was

298
00:27:37,23 --> 00:27:42,85
up in sydney all the time and he was well
known as the pipe manager for the. For

299
00:27:42,85 --> 00:27:49,78
the caledonian society in
sydney. Mackay. He led the. He

300
00:27:49,78 --> 00:27:55,30
led the band with the bridge workers in
the opening procession as well. So i just

301
00:27:55,30 --> 00:27:59,22
wondered if you know.
So well i haven't any

302
00:28:02,32 --> 00:28:03,62
indelible impression as of

303
00:28:04,48 --> 00:28:08,99
a fellow but i did work at knox grammar
school for about three years and the pipe

304
00:28:08,99 --> 00:28:14,02
major there was named mackay. But it might
have been the same i know later on in

305
00:28:14,02 --> 00:28:14,71
his life he kept

306
00:28:14,71 --> 00:28:21,45
a garage five double. Oh i couldn't say
that i recollect it like him. Did you hear

307
00:28:21,45 --> 00:28:25,05
of any of the names of the other any of the
other stern masons that works in sydney

308
00:28:25,05 --> 00:28:30,79
i understand there were four. Yes yes
yes. In addition to william summers in

309
00:28:31,68 --> 00:28:38,62
arnold's yard in at paddington alongside
of him worked. Jimmy mac miller and jimmy

310
00:28:38,62 --> 00:28:44,37
macmillan was i worked alongside of jimmy
mcmillan as an apprentice in the maria

311
00:28:44,37 --> 00:28:47,19
sheds do you remember another one.

312
00:28:52,24 --> 00:28:59,14
Another one that came up to
sydney. Now my memory fails

313
00:28:59,14 --> 00:29:04,03
me there. Well you've done very well
because it. You've got the two the jimmy

314
00:29:04,04 --> 00:29:10,81
mcmillan and the other one was some what
was his first bill somers if i had more

315
00:29:10,81 --> 00:29:17,68
time to think i could recall to mind
some motions that pulled out of

316
00:29:17,68 --> 00:29:22,51
maria subsequently and well the third one.
We have is time. So we've got three out

317
00:29:22,51 --> 00:29:28,16
of the four in actual fact the names
of the ones that worked in sydney. You

318
00:29:28,17 --> 00:29:32,44
remember the other delegates up
there and it. Maria. Yes the a

319
00:29:32,44 --> 00:29:39,10
w delegate was percy manning
and my father robert

320
00:29:39,10 --> 00:29:45,88
crap you member any of the others. Here the
stern masons delegate was arthur woody

321
00:29:45,88 --> 00:29:48,34
and the secretary in
sydney was richard warren

322
00:29:57,38 --> 00:29:58,38
and was assigned to thank you very much.
