1
00:00:02,86 --> 00:00:49,06
And you know. I rushed him to come in. That's when I called him you know just yet there.

2
00:00:49,07 --> 00:00:53,89
Yes I'm sorry that was just a big business that I couldn't see Roger Clinton.

3
00:00:54,17 --> 00:00:59,55
You've got don't mention this team guy is breaking into the house nice look down here.

4
00:00:59,81 --> 00:01:04,65
The night before it will let alone to tend to his land sweet

5
00:01:04,65 --> 00:01:11,05
and the condition on the inside something he did look at was you know it's one of those moments of the things it was

6
00:01:11,05 --> 00:01:14,98
it's something to see growing snaking at the deck when you got in the back door

7
00:01:14,98 --> 00:01:25,36
and I think that Indiana for the caves is really desperate which means someone that's a thing that never had to counter

8
00:01:25,36 --> 00:01:33,96
whenever it's been broken into before it's been obvious that it's like a ladder can zoom in this town.

9
00:01:34,08 --> 00:01:38,02
It just puts the next day in the water that it.

10
00:01:38,02 --> 00:01:42,79
Somebody has been there because your base isn't taken Mackay away in it.

11
00:01:42,82 --> 00:01:45,4
They've been given the OK to lock up and taking it away in the vehicle

12
00:01:45,4 --> 00:01:56,3
and thinking I'll come back there in three months to do that you know it's the Internet so we we we were well one of

13
00:01:56,3 --> 00:02:00,57
the Stop beginning to run. Where do you think was the first.

14
00:02:00,91 --> 00:02:06,49
Where do we start well as I don't to go to the tick or are there also

15
00:02:06,49 --> 00:02:11,15
when you move you into a studio give out to the drag shows or bottle bottles

16
00:02:11,15 --> 00:02:19,82
and so well in nine hundred sixty two late late go study Kings Cross.

17
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:24,68
I understand it was called the Ranch flush it became the jewel box

18
00:02:24,68 --> 00:02:32,79
and that was the first drag show that commercially Kaon when I was there. Previous to that I understand this.

19
00:02:32,92 --> 00:02:41,76
Stork Club is like sixty in the store that was right at our new reading when I was twelve

20
00:02:41,76 --> 00:02:51,79
or thirteen in truth they blew it up now that was Jimmy fish been Johnny fish been the story right and wrong.

21
00:02:52,54 --> 00:02:59,12
Yes at Broughton least Broughton's I am with that bridge there possibly like his comedies bridge

22
00:02:59,34 --> 00:03:01,75
and there was a I understand it.

23
00:03:01,78 --> 00:03:09,56
Jim and woman or an Austrian woman who ran the store club then engine efficiency to how old it was was that young

24
00:03:09,56 --> 00:03:15,44
and Rose Jackson was in that show so she would be about to tell you whether that's about.

25
00:03:15,58 --> 00:03:20,8
I think Rice Jackson came in late had its day that was

26
00:03:20,8 --> 00:03:29,65
when that was the key we boys he's known Joan hump stuff it all so full.

27
00:03:29,65 --> 00:03:32,05
He got the first directions in the store clerk.

28
00:03:32,08 --> 00:03:38,05
Well the first drag show as such as I understand it and this is only from what stories are doing

29
00:03:38,05 --> 00:03:46,73
but the key ways off to the war you with that drag thing they came and did I see at the Capitol Theater

30
00:03:46,73 --> 00:03:53,64
or on the edges of whatever it's called in those days. I'm not sure whether I soared. Or no.

31
00:03:53,87 --> 00:04:02,6
You know how you get hazy of Mother Night of taking me to see if I can remain in the John Hunt on point B.

32
00:04:02,6 --> 00:04:10,13
and Doing the know kind of thing so are doing but it's doing one of those half minute things on the balcony scene.

33
00:04:10,24 --> 00:04:13,78
But even then they're working doing the tuning in

34
00:04:13,78 --> 00:04:29,56
and a New Zealander was in it then cold enough fluffy Friedman that it was sort of one is types of names pussy

35
00:04:29,56 --> 00:04:32,1
something or another and in those days.

36
00:04:35,51 --> 00:04:40,96
I obviously have you know I was twelve or thirteen something of that and I wasn't done nothing

37
00:04:41,92 --> 00:04:47,99
but I understand that they came and from that John Hunter got established they did it well.

38
00:04:48,12 --> 00:04:54,61
I think they did it and they the national tour or an East Coast tour and from that they landed back in Sydney

39
00:04:54,61 --> 00:05:01,63
and I think from that made still club. I can over the years. Yes.

40
00:05:01,64 --> 00:05:13,69
Yeah that's with us now in dry where the other person who might be able to help you with that is of interest.

41
00:05:13,87 --> 00:05:22,84
I mean I think you might do lighting for the opera house and he would John. George.

42
00:05:22,89 --> 00:05:30,08
Jeff George John George with me when I can't go and they need in on the door

43
00:05:30,08 --> 00:05:35,07
and I think he used to do the lots for the Kiwis but you know those people you listen to them.

44
00:05:35,09 --> 00:05:41,85
You don't quite know where they do they do but I think he not have done that and he's jumped George

45
00:05:41,85 --> 00:05:50,76
and the last time I heard of him he was down there for how something exotic unchallengable So we got some.

46
00:05:51,01 --> 00:05:58,68
No go after the stone plus the club. Well I don't remember any like the still club.

47
00:05:58,83 --> 00:06:02,25
The only reason it got to They'd still club was it was a great scandal.

48
00:06:02,62 --> 00:06:05,93
If the page of the trees wrong and then just as women.

49
00:06:06,73 --> 00:06:11,14
And it out got known and have became a scandal was Madame's to cook food

50
00:06:11,14 --> 00:06:20,88
and the patrons nearly died of was just like big boys new pieces and it would be like fifty's I nearly died of them

51
00:06:20,88 --> 00:06:23,21
and that sort of how he

52
00:06:23,21 --> 00:06:28,63
and then you know how those things in that you know up until then I guess it had been in the news.

53
00:06:28,69 --> 00:06:33,47
It's a long way out there. You know years especially in the. Just as well.

54
00:06:33,47 --> 00:06:36,32
I do know the people who know it's a long way there.

55
00:06:36,32 --> 00:06:45,8
I don't think it was it a fantastic six stand testing to be successful then identity mislike grow days with over six

56
00:06:45,8 --> 00:06:57,11
o'clock wasn't just towards existence rather than to the poking and losses in the stores.

57
00:06:57,18 --> 00:07:08,97
I mean in the in those days to a new restaurant one had a license was not being made for him. Yeah that was good.

58
00:07:09,06 --> 00:07:37,3
Yeah he's going to do or you're in the right.

59
00:07:37,34 --> 00:07:47,82
You know stuff stuff and in NOT hundred sixty two you get your books sort of motivation in your endeavor wary

60
00:07:47,82 --> 00:07:56,7
or not about it in the neck then you're sixty one and it then went through like to send the January February

61
00:07:56,7 --> 00:07:59,84
and by then it was becoming fairly popular but it was sort of rough.

62
00:07:59,94 --> 00:08:05,96
I didn't bring a couple of years just say listen think it's like that and a friend of mine

63
00:08:05,96 --> 00:08:13,54
and Barry Dad I did you know if you can be a bit of me

64
00:08:13,54 --> 00:08:21,41
and I think like cool John was decided that it was really good to open a can nine and to open it in the sun.

65
00:08:21,43 --> 00:08:31,13
These are only tablets that I asked to open it on the side of the prison like that was being built at the time in a

66
00:08:31,13 --> 00:08:32,04
suit with a locked right now.

67
00:08:32,92 --> 00:08:34,37
I fact asked my advice

68
00:08:35,99 --> 00:08:43,28
and I said at the time that I thought that if that it was going to be a guy that was too close to King's Cross

69
00:08:43,28 --> 00:08:51,31
and I should go out of it when I manage to fund these things because that what did it used to be before you.

70
00:08:52,79 --> 00:08:57,92
It was originally built to sell on and then it had been turned into a a night club run by straight.

71
00:08:57,95 --> 00:08:59,91
Roger He now runs for T.V.

72
00:08:59,94 --> 00:09:05,95
There and he tried to do a thing called where you came to dinner and there was no been playing

73
00:09:05,98 --> 00:09:12,91
and just people from the tables got up to do that if I lived you like to do something else.

74
00:09:12,92 --> 00:09:16,44
Of course you know like he was a single act

75
00:09:16,44 --> 00:09:24,26
and within his acting try to get people out to do things so well that's window me. J.J.

76
00:09:24,26 --> 00:09:29,71
and John would go to the lake or the purple I guess Don't miss that stone his name for it.

77
00:09:29,71 --> 00:09:33,76
They called it the lawn because he'd taken that from the San Francisco.

78
00:09:34,23 --> 00:09:42,63
There's enough of attendances going to hear the saying so it was it was young going all week right from the start of

79
00:09:42,63 --> 00:09:51,32
the weekend. No it was only open it. I've been all week Tuesday.

80
00:09:51,47 --> 00:09:58,42
Every Sunday because it's been around growth that I could stay in on a Sunday the Tuesday Wednesday Thursday with your

81
00:09:58,42 --> 00:09:58,91
the miserable.

82
00:09:59,07 --> 00:10:12,09
I did the fish everything I was a comedian fish carries in the fish grows checksums in the fish carry something

83
00:10:12,09 --> 00:10:18,35
or another is in the fish a great skating is in the fish and do Rivers and fish and we get to fish

84
00:10:18,35 --> 00:10:22,71
and I think we used to do two shows

85
00:10:22,71 --> 00:10:31,03
and sign openings sang closings big different middles of what if it was fish being produced.

86
00:10:34,8 --> 00:10:41,66
And somehow got involved in that I was working at the time and didn't get involved much because I was a comedian.

87
00:10:41,84 --> 00:10:47,18
So I did not and would like I said I'm going to do this and I going to do it like these next

88
00:10:49,76 --> 00:10:54,67
and then the next second show they're talking about doing that I did the second show with them

89
00:10:54,9 --> 00:11:02,62
but by then I wasn't doing she's done wings day. I don't agree to do this day Friday.

90
00:11:02,65 --> 00:11:09,86
Now don't you going to do Friday citizen to that have another comedian doing it was gone because I got to be like I was

91
00:11:09,86 --> 00:11:17,45
working as it does in the loft and gun to take two and it was just to go there

92
00:11:17,63 --> 00:11:22,16
and there was fair amount of drama in the sense that they got a few square people in

93
00:11:22,16 --> 00:11:28,11
and they had to collect the money for the second show squeeze with if they didn't have bounces

94
00:11:28,11 --> 00:11:30,84
and they would put the show on because the screws didn't pay the money

95
00:11:30,84 --> 00:11:33,98
and I used to get frantic people because we supposed to go on the toilet.

96
00:11:34,32 --> 00:11:40,7
Sometimes you go into one which you can get up to and I had to go to work in the seventy one. If I'm standing.

97
00:11:40,73 --> 00:11:52,36
So I cut it down to one appearing Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Sunday had always being a big No I think totally

98
00:11:52,36 --> 00:12:01,97
involved around the fact that you're being run girl and it cost them nothing like a custom two bucks

99
00:12:01,97 --> 00:12:04,8
or whatever it was to come in and they just gathered up the crowd from the party the night before

100
00:12:04,8 --> 00:12:14,01
and kind of you know as they would. There was no place to sit and go on a Sunday. Only it was never restored.

101
00:12:14,06 --> 00:12:22,99
No eventually got to the stage where they had to sit sandwiches

102
00:12:22,99 --> 00:12:28,18
and things like that in the kitchen because it was never a risk of the eye to have become a restaurant I just have to

103
00:12:28,18 --> 00:12:32,85
make one phone call the other time because a restaurant once when getting older. It wanted to come out more to get.

104
00:12:33,46 --> 00:12:56,17
Yeah and the black C.D.'s are paid in the seven years just here in the States. Joining us now to see you. I'm six.

105
00:13:01,76 --> 00:13:11,16
Do you remember a place called the any For us it was you know the cinema halfway along that mine right down this road

106
00:13:11,16 --> 00:13:15,13
in the cross which is notable as a pinball machine so yes I do remember that

107
00:13:15,13 --> 00:13:27,65
and it's in between after the Purple Onion opened Cuban would learn you know I would have city No sixty two years

108
00:13:27,91 --> 00:13:33,91
because ladles opened in November sixty two and that's not its present song. Yeah yeah.

109
00:13:34,54 --> 00:13:39,59
What happened as far as my personal stuff was considered I did the first show with the maybe the purple

110
00:13:39,59 --> 00:13:40,81
and you know tonight it is.

111
00:13:41,22 --> 00:13:49,21
And the show would run for two months then I did the second show which would have run for another six weeks

112
00:13:49,44 --> 00:13:56,34
and they're into the show and I said I couldn't do it because I was studying and I was working very hard

113
00:13:57,8 --> 00:13:58,81
and they would pay me what I wanted

114
00:13:59,9 --> 00:14:09,49
and I was a big I was a bit sick of it in the sense that there was no organization like it was just a mess still was

115
00:14:09,49 --> 00:14:10,91
there and then they'd sell that to rise.

116
00:14:10,91 --> 00:14:12,58
Jackson who became partner in it

117
00:14:12,58 --> 00:14:18,62
and Jimmy Fishman was directing that really putting sticking his nose in the business side

118
00:14:18,62 --> 00:14:20,32
and really wanting to get in on the business.

119
00:14:21,14 --> 00:14:26,53
With no wanted to get in on some sort of talent that he thought he had you know like and.

120
00:14:26,83 --> 00:14:32,58
If you just got too boring for me even in those days the girls dressed up in that dressing.

121
00:14:33,09 --> 00:14:34,69
And I just don't miss a part

122
00:14:34,69 --> 00:14:39,54
and being the comedian I could really rock five minutes before it went on to get just to go on

123
00:14:41,31 --> 00:14:45,49
and I never ever got involved like the girls Joey stories now.

124
00:14:45,66 --> 00:14:51,54
I never got involved in like some of them were leaving there the time and the trade was there.

125
00:14:51,68 --> 00:14:59,62
I just never was involved in any of that I don't know what the personal things were at that time I left there

126
00:15:01,43 --> 00:15:07,85
and I'd left there and I got wood back that Sammy Lee wanted me to even in his show.

127
00:15:08,52 --> 00:15:13,91
That's how I sort of get that together and I said No I didn't want to do you like this.

128
00:15:13,91 --> 00:15:15,53
And by then he got lost her

129
00:15:15,53 --> 00:15:24,29
and he got in the girls from across you know they're pretty good lookers because I've always felt that the Purple was

130
00:15:24,29 --> 00:15:29,83
the training ground. You know how like they say young film stuff.

131
00:15:30,16 --> 00:15:35,3
Like they said Julie Andrews is really fantastic as a film star because she had to let training they loved English

132
00:15:35,3 --> 00:15:35,98
skills to come over

133
00:15:35,98 --> 00:15:40,96
and make it good in Hollywood because they were trained in whatever they did they went just pretty faces.

134
00:15:41,11 --> 00:15:46,04
Well that's what happened with the purple and in the purple and used to get those kids on a Sunday afternoon

135
00:15:46,04 --> 00:15:54,09
and help and then the big plan on there was like girls but he finally persuaded me to work fifteen.

136
00:15:54,19 --> 00:16:02,84
I would get a tick and I finished ticket nine and I'd be up there by nine thirty. Not that I'd be time for the fish.

137
00:16:03,42 --> 00:16:08,23
And then I would do the late show ID deficient the second show and then I would come home

138
00:16:08,23 --> 00:16:15,2
and that went on for about eight weeks and it was desperately down bodies in the room it was really just nobody can.

139
00:16:15,74 --> 00:16:22,19
Yes it was very struggling and semi's to tears here

140
00:16:22,19 --> 00:16:30,66
and say Yes I've paid he somehow thought he was going to get the Queen's Yes I think fifteen bucks for the seats just

141
00:16:30,66 --> 00:16:33,82
as perfect as I'm done enough. I'm going to what's the matter.

142
00:16:34,17 --> 00:16:43,38
I've got these fantastic show look at these boys did all this there was an incident up at Les Girls where they thought

143
00:16:43,38 --> 00:16:45,86
four of them are there for some reason or another.

144
00:16:47,13 --> 00:16:54,63
I didn't even know what all that was about but there was an incident in the dressing room where rage being kind out

145
00:16:54,63 --> 00:17:00,56
and just screamed at the people he was firing and screen and said You fuckin poofters are all the same of course

146
00:17:00,56 --> 00:17:09,13
and I just dream myself up and said I just have to be one of those who does and I will not be back to myself up

147
00:17:09,13 --> 00:17:16,83
and I never went back there because it was just one of those you know they were square we were camping there

148
00:17:17,4 --> 00:17:24,19
and I wasn't prepared at that stage to work under those conditions. So I left around about December.

149
00:17:24,74 --> 00:17:26,04
Maybe round about December.

150
00:17:26,63 --> 00:17:34,95
Then they had about January first to second send me through to whatever it was they did they didn't mean something on

151
00:17:34,95 --> 00:17:35,59
television

152
00:17:36,44 --> 00:17:41,95
and they'd be thirty teams going to skating Not that I had color on as the boy getting made up to be the beautiful

153
00:17:41,95 --> 00:17:52,51
woman and of being straights the Bankstown of the group because it is just from then on never looked back

154
00:17:52,87 --> 00:17:59,27
and then it just shot forward then from then on after that they just took cues out there

155
00:17:59,44 --> 00:18:08,3
and then it became the glamorous city none of that like it really did for those four years that it ran into five knees.

156
00:18:08,43 --> 00:18:10,81
It was the talk show

157
00:18:10,84 --> 00:18:18,97
and like everybody would like if there was a visiting celebrity they were there for a late night drink

158
00:18:18,97 --> 00:18:25,32
or they have even those people are upstaged is that was a venture that wasn't there to begin with living with that kind

159
00:18:25,32 --> 00:18:28,43
of data and the drink went to well but it was who was there.

160
00:18:28,46 --> 00:18:32,43
Yes it was it then became the trading place for the door and that's wrong.

161
00:18:32,92 --> 00:18:38,81
It's clear that if you come in here for a bit of a look around a week and you're out in December.

162
00:18:39,01 --> 00:18:41,42
Then that we January February

163
00:18:42,29 --> 00:18:47,92
and being Scorpio I think I've been my own club in more London is going all the time through here. Oh.

164
00:18:48,18 --> 00:18:55,99
Jimmy Fishman Did he is the in a round about October because he couldn't get what he wanted from don't know what if it

165
00:18:56,19 --> 00:18:57,09
happened there. I don't know.

166
00:18:57,18 --> 00:18:59,75
He pulled all of the kids out of the onion

167
00:18:59,75 --> 00:19:12,39
and put them in a show called pay bills at the St James stage race put the Legion can make a fugitive down to me on

168
00:19:12,39 --> 00:19:21,71
snoozing surviving which I did it was not a theist and then he packed them down to the peninsula playhouse down.

169
00:19:21,91 --> 00:19:23,7
Avallone and moved in there

170
00:19:23,7 --> 00:19:33,17
and all he succeeded in doing was a needy destroying them years because he pulled the entire cost of not one stand

171
00:19:33,17 --> 00:19:38,85
but fortunately Domi rise Jackson was a prime mover in that because she was friends of Jimmy

172
00:19:38,85 --> 00:19:41,19
and she wanted to get Domi I think.

173
00:19:41,46 --> 00:19:44,9
Fortunately don't we put another show together

174
00:19:44,9 --> 00:19:53,38
and that's way you got Queensland Robin tale coming like that with the second generation going good sort of Robin bow

175
00:19:53,38 --> 00:19:56,52
tail twice a time not that she's you know to try

176
00:19:56,52 --> 00:20:06,29
and people like that came into that second show that Britain Williams and into that second show push there

177
00:20:06,29 --> 00:20:14,57
and in fact to that that show they John hunted it from the original Kiwis he produced and directed it

178
00:20:14,57 --> 00:20:19,47
and it was called How the West was one of the line and he had a beautiful voice

179
00:20:19,47 --> 00:20:27,39
and it used to weigh in with how the West was well that of the boss and Joel was a beat up

180
00:20:27,39 --> 00:20:31,86
and so he said I think you're with the Stars and no show is going to be glamorous because the people.

181
00:20:33,31 --> 00:20:41,02
The queens have gotten used to the Stuff like there could be quite to be like loved to real cool shoes you know what if

182
00:20:41,02 --> 00:20:44,2
she was already a scene good strides

183
00:20:44,2 --> 00:20:51,08
but didn't keep Oh yes trendy thing again she had no luck to carry pushy was young in their graves Christian fuckin

184
00:20:51,08 --> 00:20:52,44
country what is the law

185
00:20:53,92 --> 00:21:02,4
and that the show barely scraped through the door me managed to scrape the onion through because there was nowhere else

186
00:21:02,4 --> 00:21:14,07
to go betweens were there NEVER else to go straight through until eventually of course the fish been stabbed in the

187
00:21:14,07 --> 00:21:21,98
back turned on him and the people started to come back to the cost to drink after only because it just never would.

188
00:21:22,55 --> 00:21:24,07
And eventually it ended up.

189
00:21:24,73 --> 00:21:30,11
I guess we rest Jackson came back quick Harry came back with a cavern came back

190
00:21:30,11 --> 00:21:36,33
and was then just reaching shit your shoes the speaker in your reach and Karen came back seven then Chile.

191
00:21:36,7 --> 00:21:39,44
They all kind back to the onion so it got a new lease of life.

192
00:21:39,52 --> 00:21:49,05
I would have thought in about the December January February of January February of sixty three in February sixty three.

193
00:21:50,78 --> 00:22:01,79
I opened Katie's got to live in Moore and had a long struggle there for about three months

194
00:22:01,97 --> 00:22:10,88
and suddenly the same people who had been coming out to the line in food two years on a Sunday who lived at

195
00:22:10,88 --> 00:22:14,68
paediatrician discovered my show on a Sunday

196
00:22:15,01 --> 00:22:20,19
and suddenly instead of booking the twenty at the end they booked the twenty at me

197
00:22:20,19 --> 00:22:23,82
and of course there's not many people they said they considered fighting to seats

198
00:22:23,82 --> 00:22:32,9
and all that they got the treatment and naturally shows good. Well it really had three in the center of some and none.

199
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:41,61
And myself and no no because he does something I think he's flown

200
00:22:41,61 --> 00:22:50,3
and shifted to something there is it's really it's in and that was the Stosh and then after that it just build up

201
00:22:50,64 --> 00:22:53,91
and eventually Candy's got to be true which only quite small.

202
00:22:53,99 --> 00:22:58,12
It took a hundred people to have to be crushed in and we became very popular

203
00:22:58,12 --> 00:23:02,05
but what we didn't take was we took the cream off the money

204
00:23:02,05 --> 00:23:08,43
and it in being through such Duraid full financial straits they had to pay.

205
00:23:08,49 --> 00:23:14,11
I think with the snow coming in there were people living and the other still living in the flights of stairs

206
00:23:14,11 --> 00:23:19,89
and they took out objections and they used to pull water through the ceiling.

207
00:23:20,09 --> 00:23:22,96
We used to have to work with the religious and

208
00:23:22,96 --> 00:23:31,21
and then I had to finally pay them five dollars to get there which they paid in of course once you start home.

209
00:23:31,44 --> 00:23:35,58
It's like poor bloody Judy Garland isn't it the less that Texas you can get out of there.

210
00:23:35,68 --> 00:23:40,69
The public should think I'll make a million dollars on this but they would take it in dollars to current taxes

211
00:23:40,69 --> 00:23:41,83
and you know

212
00:23:41,83 --> 00:23:49,52
and they never quite got out of that domain was hopeless with money as with money they didn't have much have to wait

213
00:23:49,52 --> 00:23:54,1
for a while he was pretty good with money but it gets on the vocal for six months.

214
00:23:54,41 --> 00:23:56,57
None of this will be quoted and just you know.

215
00:23:56,71 --> 00:24:01,69
No I don't want these I'm telling you now still to this is a question mark over just yesterday.

216
00:24:01,84 --> 00:24:05,11
I'm just trying to get you into gear is to have all that happen

217
00:24:05,11 --> 00:24:11,66
and then we got then my club became very very popular and the onion went down because of the

218
00:24:11,66 --> 00:24:16,18
and I didn't much like being in it anymore.

219
00:24:16,42 --> 00:24:19,09
You know it was all around that it was really town

220
00:24:19,09 --> 00:24:24,38
and I really wanted to be back at the onion because to me that was the camp.

221
00:24:24,4 --> 00:24:32,81
Although I was getting canned out there sort of a long way to come in around the open Friday Saturday sound before the.

222
00:24:32,92 --> 00:24:38,96
Says it. So why did the end about two hundred.

223
00:24:39,62 --> 00:24:48,66
I think on those nights where they pushed him back in the north and so I made I did choose to do me

224
00:24:49,41 --> 00:24:58,09
and we became I closed the garden day and took my cost over to The Onion

225
00:24:59,3 --> 00:25:05,44
and I don't know whether that was in the June of sixty three

226
00:25:05,7 --> 00:25:11,55
or whether I had gone for nothing at all in more if I had gone for another year doing more it would have been in the

227
00:25:11,55 --> 00:25:18,03
gene sixty four and I think I don't think I was successful if I had been in February.

228
00:25:18,06 --> 00:25:20,42
I don't think I was that successful by Gene.

229
00:25:20,45 --> 00:25:26,16
I think to the gist of my struck me is that it was you happy for you because I'm all right

230
00:25:26,16 --> 00:25:34,81
but I mean that's just because I just think we used to go there to be a total union sixty three is the first you know

231
00:25:34,92 --> 00:25:37,9
instantly going to the good.

232
00:25:38,59 --> 00:25:45,23
So it must be more like I think it would have been easy for I've really got to the stage where it was really damaging

233
00:25:45,23 --> 00:25:52,55
the Purple Onion. You know and the line because that's we had to combine to be you know way out of it.

234
00:25:52,79 --> 00:25:56,59
What was the sensible who did this because I mean eventually somebody says love you.

235
00:25:56,98 --> 00:26:00,67
Well what happened was I brought my customer who number five in

236
00:26:01,08 --> 00:26:06,71
and I think we dropped two of my custom kit three do nice custom we came out of that

237
00:26:07,14 --> 00:26:18,41
and from then on the onion was just there because it was established and the people who'd done on all the time too.

238
00:26:18,44 --> 00:26:21,9
It was sufficient to at least make bread and butter

239
00:26:21,9 --> 00:26:30,01
and all of the people who had been coming to me just filmed it went through that period after that

240
00:26:30,01 --> 00:26:31,67
when the straight started to come.

241
00:26:33,24 --> 00:26:41,52
And cold's Follett's that was before the Queen's And you know there were a few just sent in those days of course of

242
00:26:41,52 --> 00:26:46,93
thought it was just people just talk about it and don't go out that is fun. It's that sort of thing.

243
00:26:46,97 --> 00:26:59,02
So then domain I was in this for a year and we fell out of the money you give Domi the takings

244
00:26:59,02 --> 00:27:07,27
and say you drop us into the bank and then the next week because you called a chick with bounce and I said to me.

245
00:27:07,3 --> 00:27:09,53
What did you do that. Didn't you put that money in the bank.

246
00:27:09,53 --> 00:27:14,38
It's of no board feds didn't you know this guy I know just with I had three figures on the top of my head of ten.

247
00:27:14,41 --> 00:27:18,06
OK I was only noticing trying to get a B.S.

248
00:27:18,06 --> 00:27:18,49
Together

249
00:27:18,49 --> 00:27:25,23
and he didn't have a lanyard was that sort of because you only had the money at the dual no other you know two box at

250
00:27:25,23 --> 00:27:29,93
the door you had two hundred people you could never make more than one hundred dollars all.

251
00:27:30,98 --> 00:27:35,78
And if you had a bad night on this day and a bad night on Friday and the beat.

252
00:27:35,83 --> 00:27:36,27
Sunday

253
00:27:36,27 --> 00:27:42,87
and the just sort of you know if it was never that big money that you could make from a restaurant where if you sell

254
00:27:42,87 --> 00:27:44,35
drinks if you sell food.

255
00:27:44,58 --> 00:27:52,02
It was just at that all there and that's why you squeezed said many people in because that's the only money.

256
00:27:53,57 --> 00:27:58,06
Now the girls are a really cool rage way just in my doing.

257
00:27:58,08 --> 00:28:01,5
I suppose because you were king Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday

258
00:28:01,5 --> 00:28:08,81
and I maintained just the same as I was with King Jr many of those girls who said

259
00:28:08,81 --> 00:28:14,38
and some of the wages of the supplement knew I was a bit hot in those days

260
00:28:14,38 --> 00:28:21,44
and then says I was hot in the sense that I if it was they business if they grew their hair long

261
00:28:21,44 --> 00:28:32,57
and wanted to be ladies and couldn't get a job there. If that's not at all. They said then that.

262
00:28:32,92 --> 00:28:40,9
And for a donkey and I still eat quite badly. I suppose beings.

263
00:28:40,93 --> 00:28:50,93
I stayed in and I were in the fifth onion gave up my day job and ran for Harry in the six

264
00:28:51,83 --> 00:29:00,51
and I was the boss cocky going to actually close down before the end I was getting very very tired because I'd been

265
00:29:00,51 --> 00:29:08,34
doing it for five years and I was always the style sort of and I always did you know put just together

266
00:29:09,6 --> 00:29:16,82
and the costumes and in nice days of course it was if you didn't get in the shade by six weeks that's very yes yes yes.

267
00:29:17,51 --> 00:29:25,75
And if it went for six weeks you know they told us they didn't come on it's so it was really that frantic rush I had no

268
00:29:25,75 --> 00:29:31,87
life not much at all then. But because I gave a party to get you some of these records.

269
00:29:32,72 --> 00:29:41,3
You know if you have enough of this he however I got very tired and then I had the other how do you come to do that

270
00:29:41,85 --> 00:29:46,93
when you know that the two things that I really remember one was it all go yes.

271
00:29:46,96 --> 00:29:55,58
Nixon was just staring them in the other which was the funny thing was the six steps from the ship

272
00:29:56,21 --> 00:30:03,00
but rather it's what you get isn't always on the screen you're going yeah you're doing isn't the kind of patient number

273
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:14,3
of you know that your viewers in the other we all used to be on to that didn't we actually that was the sixth it came

274
00:30:14,3 --> 00:30:21,99
from my regional beagle regional number at the end was the finger in the bottle which I used to send up because Jen

275
00:30:21,99 --> 00:30:29,1
Sutherland you just heat and I used to do it to a forty five on seventy eight doing.

276
00:30:30,25 --> 00:30:38,84
Romeo and Juliet the Jewett from Romeo and Juliet. The what if it was injured..

277
00:30:33,96 --> 00:30:38,84
It was a thing stuck in the bucket not being able to get it out and that was my Mr B.

278
00:30:38,88 --> 00:30:43,25
However the novice thing that's wonderful for me is Robert Hill

279
00:30:43,25 --> 00:30:47,61
and the boy that is only now creates we're speaking about that number

280
00:30:47,61 --> 00:30:56,17
and today me if ever they see a dreary show they were telling me that they said it's nice to think in the book that

281
00:30:56,17 --> 00:31:06,59
need this with we should put the thing in the book if they remember it from Mr steer they tell me that the way to him

282
00:31:06,59 --> 00:31:12,32
has stolen the finger in the book from me because he's doing pleasant laughter by you know how the America

283
00:31:12,32 --> 00:31:16,06
and he's doing one whole scene chimping but it just got on his hand

284
00:31:16,06 --> 00:31:24,23
but they said he's just doing it the Shia ness Innes it's not home but they were seen as the sort of sit down

285
00:31:24,23 --> 00:31:33,9
and that was such a success is that the next thing that I did was the sixth hit going in for a lot of us having a

286
00:31:33,9 --> 00:31:34,33
screen.

287
00:31:34,35 --> 00:31:42,81
One was there tied to that and if you're into the tank to the guy things of the other two would open up the strip.

288
00:31:42,91 --> 00:31:50,47
I was another we have a Kurdish if we have but it is devotees of yes see things.

289
00:31:50,58 --> 00:31:59,02
Yes for the loves but yes for that we will attack he said that would have been sixty sixty four.

290
00:31:59,13 --> 00:32:01,99
Then I don't know when I was getting very tired

291
00:32:01,99 --> 00:32:09,51
and I said to go to Stuart who is the solicitor vising about a few things like they would YOU Mendus things I have

292
00:32:09,51 --> 00:32:18,19
place. Hassles then luck I was the one who made the decision at the bill and in the boys would dance together.

293
00:32:18,45 --> 00:32:25,48
The argument of being there before that was the last thing I were told not to the police coming in

294
00:32:25,48 --> 00:32:28,25
and just looking around. But what then.

295
00:32:28,34 --> 00:32:32,82
Dhoni was still there because I'm going to send him we're going to have to let the boys dents.

296
00:32:34,05 --> 00:32:37,74
You know I said look we're going to be a gay club. We may as well. Five it now.

297
00:32:37,77 --> 00:32:44,00
And fortunately just at that stage that dance where you get in touch and come out and you land up and you keep it

298
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:44,33
and you didn't.

299
00:32:44,45 --> 00:32:49,33
And so you only needed one along and that's where the disco taught not touching

300
00:32:49,33 --> 00:32:52,83
and said that's how you get away with it and

301
00:32:52,83 --> 00:32:58,46
when they tell you need a couple of times they said who's dancing with you in a So I think that goes dancing with those

302
00:32:58,46 --> 00:33:01,43
five boys if they're in it because then they just.

303
00:33:03,41 --> 00:33:05,9
Min they used to harass is about the line

304
00:33:05,9 --> 00:33:16,92
and it came back on me later with a local bloke used to come through to say I ten if we walk a lot on that we had in

305
00:33:16,92 --> 00:33:23,41
the place and say you need more Lots of luck he would think they were the LOTS of the show and had dark hair

306
00:33:23,41 --> 00:33:30,68
and they were wearing for me then I wanted to get out of it

307
00:33:30,68 --> 00:33:42,28
and by then a queen had opened had become the publican at the Sussex hotel down in Sussex Terry.

308
00:33:42,45 --> 00:33:56,55
No no no no it just transfer the mind all I did know just sort of this. And yes later on stuff when it's more of them.

309
00:33:56,57 --> 00:34:07,21
It became like it was the first part of the breaks and to be end by I can play it really jumped

310
00:34:07,21 --> 00:34:10,6
and I was very impressed.

311
00:34:10,88 --> 00:34:18,62
Up until then I thought you had to be married to hold a license and he is that his and he said no

312
00:34:18,62 --> 00:34:24,74
and then I went into it and realised you didn't have to marry and that sort of stuff we have known.

313
00:34:24,84 --> 00:34:34,08
Was the one to do that sort of the brewery. Yes He just told us he'd been going to steward. So of this year.

314
00:34:34,28 --> 00:34:36,58
Is he being equipped to steward.

315
00:34:36,79 --> 00:34:43,23
So they didn't have any Wasn't I've been taken by countrymen that they finally caught him years and years

316
00:34:43,23 --> 00:34:49,51
and years later I understand in the great Bond I become a public by then that I understood that they caught him selling

317
00:34:49,51 --> 00:34:59,7
her the role. Whatever they did and said get and do and he left Sydney and took a puppet Queensland button.

318
00:34:59,73 --> 00:35:05,09
Peter against him for some reason the place he wasn't open.

319
00:35:06,13 --> 00:35:10,82
Obviously when he took it on he was your food Watkins if you want to steward with the mother

320
00:35:10,87 --> 00:35:15,38
and he was not you wouldn't even think he was going in. You spoke to him.

321
00:35:15,4 --> 00:35:21,74
So that's how we got and up until enough of us to do we have any. Oh yeah.

322
00:35:21,94 --> 00:35:29,64
The group of the way that I wasn't I'm not to that I don't know what that he st was was a mean

323
00:35:29,64 --> 00:35:31,79
when I first became aware that it was very much dark.

324
00:35:31,86 --> 00:35:33,93
Which now it's me I said it's much nicer

325
00:35:33,93 --> 00:35:38,76
and I'm not sure whether he was even there they knew judicially the docs wrong in the back

326
00:35:38,76 --> 00:35:41,12
or I couldn't be going in there. You're from Boston.

327
00:35:41,48 --> 00:35:46,71
There's a little room off the back of the jukebox that was much later much later years that it was a guy it not about

328
00:35:46,71 --> 00:35:54,64
me being gay for months. You know I didn't know how it was packed. Again at last. So they could see day.

329
00:35:54,99 --> 00:36:01,71
And maybe it was a nine day wonder as being can maybe it was in Sussex Street it was in city.

330
00:36:01,86 --> 00:36:10,58
You couldn't park it it was quiet. It was easy in the sense of I know that I was told about it.

331
00:36:10,66 --> 00:36:16,57
I went to it and I was at The Onion. So it would have meant that I had to have time to go.

332
00:36:16,68 --> 00:36:19,72
Like I would have made time to go in there.

333
00:36:20,68 --> 00:36:21,69
Like I wasn't

334
00:36:21,69 --> 00:36:31,28
when I was working into the onion not a great team was in your head at seven that fit into the round until nine thirty

335
00:36:31,28 --> 00:36:36,43
guys got in which we did. You know. And by then you just you get ready to go on.

336
00:36:36,56 --> 00:36:38,56
I think when they don't live in cause the pubs closed.

337
00:36:38,59 --> 00:36:45,42
Tainio you know to tend to because the pubs close to ten days she's chosen it wasn't on a Friday

338
00:36:45,42 --> 00:36:50,76
or Saturday night I wasn't and never have been the sort of person who can go out for phones on the edge.

339
00:36:51,78 --> 00:36:56,6
So I would have to make to do you know things which are things I don't know.

340
00:36:56,6 --> 00:37:04,46
He tracked down down that I have to think and I don't let my friends of mine take company in view of the

341
00:37:04,46 --> 00:37:12,32
and in that way down there. I can ask Kate if she moves into any of us the brave.

342
00:37:12,41 --> 00:37:16,74
She's the one where we need to find out who I did not behave in check.

343
00:37:16,81 --> 00:37:23,32
Because they've been a bit of a cop a breeze chasing of the sugar glossy they go to that thing is that what we like

344
00:37:23,32 --> 00:37:28,56
but I just think it's socialist you're sitting here it's going to talk to you to do whatever he needs to they need from

345
00:37:28,56 --> 00:37:36,6
the Sussex hotel to what's that street where around the heart attacks they are and this is a main street going down.

346
00:37:36,67 --> 00:37:43,13
You wouldn't know the little battle just the one which runs down towards the route way.

347
00:37:43,44 --> 00:37:49,15
It's a fairly wide street only with runs along parallel the hard part going down the road. It's the big mining story.

348
00:37:49,21 --> 00:37:55,04
Yes it's a lever on St I stop a lot there set of lights there is that a listener strings of going right through Little

349
00:37:55,04 --> 00:38:00,44
Rock you come out of the city so I blocked off for the Kings Cross on the King's Cross also mystery.

350
00:38:00,58 --> 00:38:03,47
College truck because universities in it

351
00:38:03,47 --> 00:38:08,58
and if you go over there at the university the museums you did call it straight down the other side that's worked with

352
00:38:08,58 --> 00:38:12,41
Haven't you. Down got a way to put that in here that's what it is if you go down there.

353
00:38:12,7 --> 00:38:15,28
There is a pub on the corner there and I told them.

354
00:38:15,32 --> 00:38:22,2
That's not how it's McQuarrie McQuarrie Yeah that's the other I was getting along well the people came from the Sussex

355
00:38:22,2 --> 00:38:27,22
today either Council yes yes that and it never really too hot.

356
00:38:27,24 --> 00:38:29,72
I would see the trouble is there's another pub called The quarry in the city

357
00:38:29,72 --> 00:38:32,86
and there was this big probably went to a Big Macor Republican.

358
00:38:32,92 --> 00:38:41,75
Who used to go for it was in the quarry they got the hot liquor as I understand the gossip line suggest I said good

359
00:38:41,75 --> 00:38:51,83
line and I wanted to be a public and kind of mention probably because it was you know this weird is another step up

360
00:38:51,83 --> 00:39:00,25
and I wanted to be legitimate or something like that. So I want silly onion and but David Williams came out.

361
00:39:00,31 --> 00:39:08,28
David Williams was about and book The Onion for me and I pulled my fist pump

362
00:39:08,88 --> 00:39:24,64
and it was that which was the little girl that's you know. Tara wins the sixty seven thing I've made out of C.S.

363
00:39:25,37 --> 00:39:30,23
For five months I was really despicably at both the pub

364
00:39:30,26 --> 00:39:42,6
and realised I'd made it bottoms terrible terrible mistake because it was a tiny poem I didn't know anything about the

365
00:39:42,98 --> 00:39:47,22
I thought people were on a system they were and in those days.

366
00:39:48,81 --> 00:39:50,91
If you were the public and if you didn't know what you doing.

367
00:39:50,91 --> 00:39:54,82
They just just swept the floor with you

368
00:39:54,82 --> 00:40:03,33
and I did the pub out just gracefully just a moment of the I called it the vulgar room

369
00:40:03,33 --> 00:40:09,49
and wanted to be what I thought was downtrodden Russian

370
00:40:09,49 --> 00:40:16,9
and it was just the old guy just really disgustingly above it just never got anywhere near what I thought of this guy

371
00:40:16,9 --> 00:40:24,41
today waiting fact the Queens really wanted somebody shake they were they thought because they'd seen you on the stage

372
00:40:24,41 --> 00:40:27,96
the planning doing all those things that I was going to open this year

373
00:40:27,96 --> 00:40:32,63
and of course I think it's terrible that that you know so I've.

374
00:40:33,83 --> 00:40:37,47
I went away for a put a manager in

375
00:40:39,91 --> 00:40:46,89
and went away for four months so I was in long way nine sixty seven days for four months and

376
00:40:46,89 --> 00:40:54,71
when I came back I went back on the stage of the robots which was the only way I could get people in

377
00:40:55,25 --> 00:41:00,45
and being back on the stage of the others of course they did come in that we could get them saved

378
00:41:00,45 --> 00:41:05,74
and they saved forms for dreams and also had a back room for the river so small.

379
00:41:05,77 --> 00:41:15,29
Yes turn community could you name the stage then what happened was that I was very fortunate because the son of the of

380
00:41:15,29 --> 00:41:18,31
the X. Had the centennial That's right.

381
00:41:18,36 --> 00:41:21,87
Packing up there and he was it was just dying on its ass

382
00:41:21,87 --> 00:41:31,81
and he desperately wanted to get out that nobody would buy it because we sixes and nobody would buy the road.

383
00:41:31,81 --> 00:41:33,74
It's the parking because it had that huge room.

384
00:41:33,99 --> 00:41:36,67
Do you know that big of a minister

385
00:41:36,67 --> 00:41:41,7
and nobody want to do it because perhaps you guys are very very bad because of this

386
00:41:41,7 --> 00:41:50,26
and it was really good because I we were I had to transfer nine of but he took my part of the trapeze

387
00:41:50,26 --> 00:41:52,00
and gave him money.

388
00:41:52,23 --> 00:41:53,2
He's a gambler

389
00:41:53,2 --> 00:42:04,17
and gave him money because he knew being the son of the publican that he could really run my tiny pub where he could be

390
00:42:04,17 --> 00:42:09,01
I could be as much a tiny I need to make my money out of entertainment right.

391
00:42:09,09 --> 00:42:12,08
And so he was just thrilled and I was still

392
00:42:12,08 --> 00:42:19,62
and I would have been just off the show straight away if it is more all this.

393
00:42:20,08 --> 00:42:25,92
Yes because I was doing the show has done it's rather jealous or interest rate out there

394
00:42:25,92 --> 00:42:31,7
and I think unfortunately I might have had three thoughts in the first three weeks.

395
00:42:33,08 --> 00:42:37,66
And the French just so you have a lot of soldiers that are going to be going as these you talk to soldiers

396
00:42:37,66 --> 00:42:48,72
and just you know sometimes you wait if you did something and the queens did not come and so I posted the OK

397
00:42:48,72 --> 00:42:55,88
and to bring home the graffiti that somebody had told me about the Fijian and Kate did a conduit

398
00:42:56,19 --> 00:43:07,27
and she plastered this back with posters of films you know this here post is there's just no it was just a huge has to

399
00:43:07,27 --> 00:43:14,74
say Gone With The Wind in the head one not the eye with people just wrote on there and just and it was a fantastic

400
00:43:15,78 --> 00:43:20,43
but it really just there to introduce the graphic. What have you done.

401
00:43:20,46 --> 00:43:26,74
You know scope mission which is this it's graphic about the police incident on one of the things which was an LP some

402
00:43:26,74 --> 00:43:34,78
Isn't Paul Newman and I think the thing was a promise of gold what a movie it was and Charles had written out of it.

403
00:43:34,79 --> 00:43:37,85
OK some of this out of Paul Newman's mouth.

404
00:43:37,92 --> 00:43:40,74
I thought what if we were moans

405
00:43:40,74 --> 00:43:48,39
and she said Oh you must be in the business you know she plays kinds of That's Disgusting. It's disgusting.

406
00:43:48,67 --> 00:43:49,24
What you mean it's

407
00:43:49,24 --> 00:43:57,6
and we know he means enough as a humane that she's such a sophisticated girl it's the ones that mean.

408
00:43:57,75 --> 00:44:00,46
And I sit down and try and follow the self.

409
00:44:00,58 --> 00:44:05,44
They just made me wouldn't let me go and said You have to take all that

410
00:44:05,44 --> 00:44:15,5
and just we've been through in that we really do that over the parking structure

411
00:44:15,5 --> 00:44:22,18
or you know we still we did that change the bicycle the path knew what happened was it was a terribly rough pub in that

412
00:44:22,18 --> 00:44:27,89
they that place closed for we at some stage or another and then to get its new twelve o'clock license.

413
00:44:28,02 --> 00:44:32,47
They had just a distraction that's when it was called the parking wrong but that had already.

414
00:44:32,92 --> 00:44:37,17
I know it's finally worked. But it was going to go.

415
00:44:37,18 --> 00:44:39,05
So it was something to fight

416
00:44:39,05 --> 00:44:44,39
and I was some of the company's young it's other rather what's inspired A which is the evil station in the hood

417
00:44:44,39 --> 00:44:50,78
but there's a lot of young you know just young like it always did have the bad seed had to overclock last

418
00:44:50,78 --> 00:44:53,15
and say it's said that we didn't get the ten o'clock

419
00:44:53,15 --> 00:45:01,21
and then being a day would come near it always I feel that I was possible that part of it was possibly the first part

420
00:45:01,21 --> 00:45:01,45
of

421
00:45:01,45 --> 00:45:09,69
and it brought him he said should hate me that recruited to use who woods this way voice from Paddington because they realized

422
00:45:09,69 --> 00:45:11,83
that they could come up there and read a drag queen in the wind

423
00:45:11,83 --> 00:45:14,74
and the next day they could get back to their girlfriends.

424
00:45:15,38 --> 00:45:19,57
And in fact they girlfriend to come and say you can't I'm with Nathan now I'm gonna make it

425
00:45:19,57 --> 00:45:22,3
and that's our own we use it

426
00:45:22,3 --> 00:45:28,73
when you made that movie the six of us down the road Robinson that was actually a bit early then didn't have a sort of

427
00:45:28,73 --> 00:45:34,00
I told you that so that somebody did show that because of the drug they gave us but I mean the bank. Yes.

428
00:45:34,83 --> 00:45:38,08
I had night that Navy and I had done.

429
00:45:38,23 --> 00:45:45,7
I said to me what we want some publicity things is anybody got any ideas about this

430
00:45:45,7 --> 00:45:52,12
and you need to get this on the crop wise I have to American you know get some publicity for it.

431
00:45:52,12 --> 00:45:54,65
Nobody had any ideas and I was leaving.

432
00:45:54,78 --> 00:45:59,95
They said Does everybody belong to us you know I don't you don't you know I'm not going to be done because they're just

433
00:45:59,95 --> 00:46:04,05
cunts and they you know when I was at the people I mean I wanted to belong to the union

434
00:46:04,05 --> 00:46:12,23
and they didn't want to drag things now that I have a feeling it was stuff they can just stick it up their ass three

435
00:46:12,23 --> 00:46:18,84
weeks later they published the guy kind of said that's really good you know and because what we've worked out is

436
00:46:18,84 --> 00:46:25,43
when you finish the scene running Mona who is the new movie is going to come up and ask you to join Union

437
00:46:25,43 --> 00:46:28,3
and you can say no and smack his face and walk off

438
00:46:28,3 --> 00:46:32,83
and that'll be really good because you need to have the let's use them there just you don't get to get.

439
00:46:33,24 --> 00:46:40,51
You said being that we didn't see that scene and the director said route we do it again

440
00:46:40,63 --> 00:46:47,07
and they only know we don't run Lent and that that was a one time. Yes I think I say so.

441
00:46:47,18 --> 00:46:50,17
We did it again at which stage of the month kind that said can you Debbie.

442
00:46:50,19 --> 00:46:54,52
Don't you know a strange man and punched in the face his lines and punch up

443
00:46:54,52 --> 00:47:00,83
and say well instead punched I think it did in the didn't they said to me.

444
00:47:00,84 --> 00:47:05,86
Thank you that in the interviews until we tell you said they would read the part of T G B U two U.E.

445
00:47:05,86 --> 00:47:09,89
They're doing things you know no interview next.

446
00:47:10,06 --> 00:47:16,57
Comment no comment on the third day they said give an interview to somebody. T.J. Been in yes I can get.

447
00:47:16,63 --> 00:47:17,58
Yes it's not like Chicago

448
00:47:17,58 --> 00:47:25,68
and then in an interview you did all this thing he is Stephen I did study the story even if it's a friend of mine was

449
00:47:25,68 --> 00:47:28,68
on the control panel at two G.B.

450
00:47:28,68 --> 00:47:36,8
and They used to be on cassettes and he said because it would come down that mountain finance gotten on oil

451
00:47:36,8 --> 00:47:47,77
and he said my kind not for bomb punch ups that happened was just for fun.

452
00:47:47,93 --> 00:47:53,59
Tom Jones he said I think that's us going into it. It was the funniest thing.

453
00:47:56,45 --> 00:48:02,09
Can you remember the other place that was very interesting to start with are these are he's used to be off with that

454
00:48:02,09 --> 00:48:02,65
liberties.

455
00:48:02,82 --> 00:48:13,41
By refine I mean benign obvious big hedge you know a rock up in Randwick bum down before Obama junction I know of on

456
00:48:13,41 --> 00:48:17,31
the junction. He's been obvious.

457
00:48:17,35 --> 00:48:24,03
I've East at Bondi Junction shy of the so shy obvious route stop at the time of the London.

458
00:48:24,2 --> 00:48:27,84
I can remember going up to Shea avi's taking the band with me.

459
00:48:27,89 --> 00:48:32,71
I used to have a live band and sing on if it was Dana Bash here at The Onion to.

460
00:48:32,95 --> 00:48:40,04
Live band up with me got the avi's in order to attract the people from ideas to feed off of this day nine

461
00:48:40,46 --> 00:48:46,74
and is the Queen's still going to Tories free as they are even today the Friday Saturday so you know you'll stay in

462
00:48:46,74 --> 00:48:54,91
Germany is it on the same side as a show of his will was in an obvious bit cagey it was a bomb. It's gone now.

463
00:48:54,99 --> 00:48:56,26
It's called something else now.

464
00:48:56,38 --> 00:48:57,76
But it was always that was

465
00:48:57,76 --> 00:49:03,18
when the original the old show it was great was that it two doors down from the oil stained buffet the birth there was

466
00:49:03,18 --> 00:49:12,07
those are the heads of those for the book right now. Will I Be So yes I V So I V's. Shay avi.

467
00:49:12,12 --> 00:49:22,15
Somebody and I do tend to put on direction. So I don't know that she's available there.

468
00:49:22,29 --> 00:49:32,28
She can change will that she had just as one of zero zero two disasters was to begin with. Yes it was her first five.

469
00:49:32,55 --> 00:49:37,8
Unfortunately started because she had a an electrician friend of Karen's T.V.

470
00:49:37,8 --> 00:49:45,78
Why are you then testy clots for the show and of course the show went on I was out of season sixteen.

471
00:49:45,82 --> 00:49:55,54
That's when it would be sixty eight because that was the first season on sixty and I produced

472
00:49:55,54 --> 00:50:08,46
and starred in the first chest at the age so it would have been a nine sixty eight because

473
00:50:08,46 --> 00:50:14,75
when she saw that she asked me what I was working I had the Lord Roberts and I put the show together.

474
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:22,68
I put two shows to get the full good and it peed in them and then I put another show together which I didn't.

475
00:50:22,68 --> 00:50:25,87
If you would just start caring and I would have cities when that show up and.

476
00:50:26,65 --> 00:50:32,79
And then Karyn did the next show like that show started when for about three months. Karyn did.

477
00:50:32,95 --> 00:50:37,67
Nick show and they put in all the spent testing and of course the office to do a couple pictures

478
00:50:37,67 --> 00:50:46,27
and jump to four o'clock and I said you can't you see the bathroom and then close down eventually.

479
00:50:46,3 --> 00:50:56,43
They went back to both going oddities avi's shot he said.

480
00:50:57,78 --> 00:51:04,41
So even when the bird bird cage was running yet there was still a wine bottle of it and the drags was still on

481
00:51:04,45 --> 00:51:05,39
and the greatest

482
00:51:05,97 --> 00:51:15,91
and it was your wife in the gave me if I don't I always use the start of the men will swear you started it.

483
00:51:15,94 --> 00:51:18,26
Shay obvious and then went back into there.

484
00:51:20,01 --> 00:51:22,29
In the main obvious big cage opened

485
00:51:22,29 --> 00:51:35,00
and again that roughness close to his fucking larrikins from the criminal element goading from my pub at that time I

486
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:45,54
was struggling. I sixty eight sixty nine I would have gone into the packing in seventy nine hundred seventy.

487
00:51:45,57 --> 00:51:50,88
I think it was only another year and a half then that the Lord Roberts maybe nine hundred seventy one

488
00:51:50,88 --> 00:51:57,7
and the cage was opened. Then because when I came back it was still open and I produced another shirt.

489
00:51:57,8 --> 00:52:03,59
When I came back from overseas and that's when I came back from overseas in sixty nine.

490
00:52:03,92 --> 00:52:12,13
That is I produced a show for the and starred in it and then I was supposed to produce and star in the next one.

491
00:52:12,17 --> 00:52:18,45
But by then the packing it come up and I went to the packing and I couldn't do the next show and.

492
00:52:18,85 --> 00:52:31,71
From then on it struggled to be it because it struggled to beat because she struggled with Karren and it shows up

493
00:52:31,71 --> 00:52:32,71
and down and then the criminal.

494
00:52:32,92 --> 00:52:38,07
And came in and there was stabbing and I remember I went one night

495
00:52:39,41 --> 00:52:45,63
and the criminals with their And I from the audience I really had a cold go at them

496
00:52:46,1 --> 00:52:53,52
and somebody threw a champagne bucket which missed me and hit somebody. Next you know in the next table.

497
00:52:53,75 --> 00:52:58,21
Whatever that was and are the arm into that not coming up to me said Oh can you please take

498
00:52:58,21 --> 00:53:02,21
and downstairs they waiting for you and I just said I feel I can't believe this.

499
00:53:02,26 --> 00:53:05,73
This is your stablish and you earned it. You manage it.

500
00:53:05,76 --> 00:53:09,78
You run it and you are telling me not to go downstairs in your premises.

501
00:53:10,26 --> 00:53:14,54
Because they waiting for me as if you aren't going to come down with me

502
00:53:14,54 --> 00:53:22,09
and shit all over you know it was just they really did frighten his people

503
00:53:22,09 --> 00:53:30,24
and that that's about time because that comes up against the services to don't know it's like seventy one of your

504
00:53:30,24 --> 00:53:30,88
calves.

505
00:53:31,11 --> 00:53:38,98
OK it's not that I'm going to have sixty nine did it so well as to being overseas

506
00:53:38,98 --> 00:53:48,27
and sixty eight of us to come back in sixty I want to be notice he's really sixty I come back in late sixty eight been

507
00:53:48,27 --> 00:53:54,42
down when caps opened. I was at the party because don't K.

508
00:53:54,42 --> 00:53:59,94
Now don't I don't know enough and asked me would I be interested in going back to the people

509
00:53:59,94 --> 00:54:04,45
and if she got I didn't against the onion she was doing some sort of deal with the council.

510
00:54:04,47 --> 00:54:13,44
Yes I will then she can see the people and it's too hard to do but we've got this up a little Italian

511
00:54:13,44 --> 00:54:19,21
and what it really is when it's called would you do the shows there. Yes I would change it three times.

512
00:54:19,62 --> 00:54:24,31
That's it is different. You differently. And if I'm from right. Yes That's OK I'll do that.

513
00:54:24,48 --> 00:54:32,52
I never heard from every can certainly caps was open and Rose was this done. You know that sixty.

514
00:54:32,95 --> 00:54:39,4
Is it was the pictures that you did.

515
00:54:40,86 --> 00:54:44,25
That's a long long while you were at the so that's sixty nine

516
00:54:44,36 --> 00:54:48,11
and caps would have been the big picture still open then was it

517
00:54:48,11 --> 00:54:53,52
or not it's not that open because the bit cagey Clay had another phone that's right.

518
00:54:53,56 --> 00:54:57,78
Yes and that's when kept So yes that they really stepped in there

519
00:54:57,88 --> 00:55:01,66
and I think an obvious went back to bombard all of that now. It was always there.

520
00:55:01,98 --> 00:55:05,81
It would be would have been that I would have struggled back there here. Yeah that's right.

521
00:55:05,92 --> 00:55:14,01
And in the meantime Beatrice the follow up also helped the Onion which was shaky then too

522
00:55:14,01 --> 00:55:30,39
and to Beatrice is bittersweet. Yes she's And really when she opened it she took she bought for me five grand.

523
00:55:30,45 --> 00:55:37,54
You can get all that after and she took and I sort of couldn't find anybody else.

524
00:55:37,55 --> 00:55:43,8
Divide that section one the part wanted to get down there was that was that so that the business

525
00:55:43,8 --> 00:55:53,32
or Oh no it was as should we have five or thousand of the five grand.

526
00:55:53,36 --> 00:56:06,61
Also for her to run the thing that I would stuff for six months more and reduce the show and give us the two dollars

527
00:56:06,61 --> 00:56:23,13
and I had somehow miraculously put in my contract that I could be found in the Regulus because I was then you're really

528
00:56:23,13 --> 00:56:31,88
into him by the time the pump got true and I just couldn't see no way of getting She just.

529
00:56:33,7 --> 00:56:43,79
This mean I didn't get a show together that I said to be I couldn't possibly star in the east and all star unit

530
00:56:44,97 --> 00:56:51,36
and I stuck her in it and then went away to me if for weeks to recover

531
00:56:52,97 --> 00:57:00,2
and she could bend you know you must come back if the show has been going on for four weeks we've got to get into his

532
00:57:00,23 --> 00:57:08,19
in the next and what are you doing. You know page that money in you promised she could not do it.

533
00:57:08,61 --> 00:57:12,43
She could not get into that that you could be tough

534
00:57:15,25 --> 00:57:20,92
and it was pointless coming back that they just wasn't sure how in the meantime she had starred in the show that I had

535
00:57:20,92 --> 00:57:23,17
produced in which is a very very good show

536
00:57:23,88 --> 00:57:29,77
and of course it was still the only place that her that I knew was still the only place where she had a captured

537
00:57:29,77 --> 00:57:30,33
audience.

538
00:57:30,37 --> 00:57:37,77
So she had to for weeks because it was the other place to go they got on to that we could we just heard it was all

539
00:57:37,77 --> 00:57:42,56
right so I I didn't come back for about six weeks I had six weeks off

540
00:57:42,59 --> 00:57:49,82
when I came back she had produced show which was very very good for producing a show ever.

541
00:57:49,85 --> 00:57:53,41
And she said that without it and starring I don't need Madame anymore.

542
00:57:54,47 --> 00:58:03,58
And for me it was she who fired me and want to do grand bank will never forgive me for that.

543
00:58:04,6 --> 00:58:13,94
MANJI years later months that she told me that she made the thirty thousand dollars in the fist hit five thousand

544
00:58:13,94 --> 00:58:21,26
dollars that she paid for it. She made history. She stated she could never go to nothing.

545
00:58:21,27 --> 00:58:26,73
You're just too easy and you know and she cut the girl's salary that buggery I thought it was pretty cool.

546
00:58:26,93 --> 00:58:32,46
She went to one once pity and lost his way she could play the foreigner in.

547
00:58:33,11 --> 00:58:36,53
Place when she came back they handed her thing that's a decision.

548
00:58:36,84 --> 00:58:41,27
We don't think the wages are enough and in the eighty's he's dead and shit out of us right.

549
00:58:41,33 --> 00:58:46,55
He was your spokeswoman Porgie been in the States from just a few get out

550
00:58:46,55 --> 00:59:04,15
and the rest of them didn't go isn't mentioned Carol. Yes Jimmy Fishburn over the place circled Parents Council. Yes.

551
00:59:04,16 --> 00:59:13,77
Did he do that. Yes he did and Karen Stout the parents started the show. Yes let's just Sunday nights All right.

552
00:59:13,77 --> 00:59:19,21
I don't know if it's one of those huge on the corner the you know yeah the Turkish restraint mugger

553
00:59:19,21 --> 00:59:20,05
or something like that.

554
00:59:20,22 --> 00:59:28,72
I think what happened there was cameras starting if youn Yes And then of course I came back after being

555
00:59:28,72 --> 00:59:33,95
and we were costarring so I was still there but she was getting a beachy

556
00:59:33,95 --> 00:59:40,89
and then of being nightclub called the golden needle the dragon it was something opened up in Queensland

557
00:59:40,89 --> 00:59:43,83
and a lot of drag queens we don't they.

558
00:59:44,05 --> 00:59:53,57
For some cross number and it died in the US and when they came back there was no place for them

559
00:59:53,57 --> 00:59:59,74
and said people like you got hold of it wasn't the spends money it was somebody else or somebody else's money

560
00:59:59,74 --> 01:00:05,16
but he was just wrong there at the door running the show all over again. I always feel.

561
01:00:05,3 --> 01:00:07,76
Do you pretend to set a target

562
01:00:07,76 --> 01:00:16,79
and he never lift the phone during that knew there was a place that tried to open that some station that what's it's

563
01:00:16,79 --> 01:00:23,1
good. I think it might actually have one know it you know and this is the skit this week behind the school.

564
01:00:23,12 --> 01:00:32,61
The big basket and that criminal fellow he got jailed for setting up television so what if there was this.

565
01:00:33,04 --> 01:00:41,56
And he's in Adelaide and there's always a few write ups but directly seen in Adelaide the week show and the big skit.

566
01:00:41,63 --> 01:00:44,62
I think what we're about to watch

567
01:00:44,77 --> 01:00:52,05
but it was a well Peter don't feed him you know the museum in museums he could mention from the council to anything

568
01:00:52,2 --> 01:00:52,63
nothing

569
01:00:53,73 --> 01:01:00,41
and he had wonderful ideas you can actually see the people that he got he was the first person he could use a muscle me

570
01:01:01,57 --> 01:01:05,29
not something stripping I didn't go because I was it. That was the time I was it.

571
01:01:06,54 --> 01:01:15,55
And because he was also the driver the sort of mile strip of place that Tory St Paul's was there to get on with you

572
01:01:15,55 --> 01:01:19,47
know and I think briefly. You know you straight.

573
01:01:19,63 --> 01:01:26,03
There are only three people sort of on but I do like

574
01:01:26,03 --> 01:01:35,53
and I think at that stage I don't think the cross you I've seen anything in the CROSSFIRE guys did used to do that.

575
01:01:35,54 --> 01:01:40,39
Well look he was very sweet was they were always in service thing I mean that was the jewel box.

576
01:01:40,43 --> 01:01:42,4
It was the any so they never lasted long

577
01:01:42,4 --> 01:01:47,64
and they had this knowledge of your future with Richard down the old road from Bill across my eyes.

578
01:01:47,64 --> 01:01:53,41
What a road that never left that long are the people. Well I mean the cross was one of those funny places but it works.

579
01:01:53,44 --> 01:01:54,68
You know it's the sort of life.

580
01:01:54,7 --> 01:01:56,78
You're not same time we've got places without them

581
01:01:56,78 --> 01:02:01,93
but then to the last that long because then Boron Leggo Well it wasn't a good night.

582
01:02:01,93 --> 01:02:08,09
But it was the largest saying that they knew that like your male strippers thing they might have thought theoretically

583
01:02:08,09 --> 01:02:13,75
that was it but they wasn't the only gay trade yesterday early. The only gay trade out there was it. The rich.

584
01:02:13,91 --> 01:02:16,97
That's where you got a letter from shiver of writing that.

585
01:02:17,02 --> 01:02:28,83
Yes because of what Norma's said as all that it was that was one of those challenges with our views will is that so

586
01:02:28,83 --> 01:02:35,11
certain. The areas around do know that. What was it called champion of the child.

587
01:02:35,8 --> 01:02:46,55
People just the Grace Brothers just about everybody stuff until this is another type the son of a slightly different

588
01:02:47,35 --> 01:02:50,53
cut all those people started when you talk about sixty two.

589
01:02:52,19 --> 01:02:56,51
What were you doing before then that the people you know about where were the very people.

590
01:02:57,42 --> 01:03:01,15
So I got there but I got it simply because I started in drag.
