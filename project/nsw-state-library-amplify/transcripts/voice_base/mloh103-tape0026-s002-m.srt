1
00:00:15,67 --> 00:00:17,37
How could a lot love in the
background even shorter.

2
00:00:19,23 --> 00:00:25,87
Like why the the eyes of the censors.
And i notices where there was this was.

3
00:00:26,43 --> 00:00:27,79
On guard.

4
00:00:29,42 --> 00:00:33,66
Build up on the g a r b u double t

5
00:00:34,42 --> 00:00:38,44
and there. So.

6
00:00:38,46 --> 00:00:44,79
Oh yes a v e r a s d o n c k.

7
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:50,50
Goes on to d. Yeah i'm john garber.

8
00:00:51,89 --> 00:00:54,60
I am 58 years of age

9
00:00:56,63 --> 00:01:03,54
and for the last ten years i've been
deeply involved in developing a

10
00:01:03,55 --> 00:01:09,57
new model for the occupancy of rural land.

11
00:01:11,75 --> 00:01:17,13
It's a village called the little clip
which we're very happy to call the solar

12
00:01:17,13 --> 00:01:19,75
village.

13
00:01:22,41 --> 00:01:28,89
In the name is peter verizon and
i've been in australia 20 years now

14
00:01:28,89 --> 00:01:34,97
and i got your query in spirit in california
refined it through further studies

15
00:01:34,97 --> 00:01:40,29
and enjoyment in the pacific and
got here around 14 years ago

16
00:01:40,29 --> 00:01:46,97
and helps create the village
a blank list so often it is

17
00:01:46,97 --> 00:01:53,94
because of this exactly
where i think about the

18
00:01:54,72 --> 00:01:59,57
nearly 900 acres and with
35 k north west of lose me.

19
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,90
No so. Villain cliffs.

20
00:02:04,23 --> 00:02:10,71
Is a privately owned strata
titled village on 908 as

21
00:02:12,11 --> 00:02:18,86
35 k north west of lismore its physical

22
00:02:18,86 --> 00:02:26,35
shape is three descending valleys.

23
00:02:28,00 --> 00:02:30,11
Of about 300 acres.

24
00:02:32,54 --> 00:02:38,93
These represent three main parts of the
village we have a north end which is very

25
00:02:38,93 --> 00:02:39,80
very secluded

26
00:02:41,82 --> 00:02:48,09
and alive with wildlife you have the centre
valley where most of the activity goes

27
00:02:48,09 --> 00:02:53,88
on and we have the south and
which is a very highly developed

28
00:02:53,88 --> 00:03:00,55
and for gannet growing it within

29
00:03:00,55 --> 00:03:05,04
these three there is lay within
another steeple sort of value.

30
00:03:05,04 --> 00:03:09,94
So from wherever you are situated billion
cliffs is a magnificent view of the

31
00:03:09,94 --> 00:03:14,14
actual cliff and bill in the flat top.

32
00:03:15,00 --> 00:03:21,28
So we live in a valley that is bounded
on one side by a flat topped cliff.

33
00:03:21,39 --> 00:03:22,84
Every team bird

34
00:03:23,93 --> 00:03:28,00
and on the other side some rolling open
land here till we reach the mackellar

35
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:33,58
ranges are going steep brains
is good and timber is.

36
00:03:33,60 --> 00:03:35,39
Popular.

37
00:03:37,82 --> 00:03:43,85
Yeah the village would have around 80
different homes or structures of meat.

38
00:03:43,85 --> 00:03:45,84
Maybe 70 would be occupied.

39
00:03:46,03 --> 00:03:49,26
And so you turned and 15 lots

40
00:03:49,27 --> 00:03:55,89
and all we certainly in selling it
up took a proper balance between the

41
00:03:55,89 --> 00:03:59,89
requirements of nature and human
requirements and economic requirements and.

42
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,35
We made a formula 30 30 30 each sell you'd
have a third of the property is under

43
00:04:05,35 --> 00:04:07,45
private control for your own gardens

44
00:04:07,45 --> 00:04:11,35
and home about a third of it is
controlled with your neighbours

45
00:04:11,35 --> 00:04:15,49
or your forestation or for some economic
activity like orchard ing ourselves

46
00:04:16,22 --> 00:04:20,87
and a third is set aside as a wildlife
area specifically to render trees back in

47
00:04:20,87 --> 00:04:27,46
when the koalas back in and still.

48
00:04:27,48 --> 00:04:33,43
You know this is where we differ from
most other communities there is no

49
00:04:33,43 --> 00:04:39,99
philosophical or religious or political
kind of ties here this was a village

50
00:04:39,99 --> 00:04:46,14
that was designed by a visionary
guy from nimbin terry magee

51
00:04:47,86 --> 00:04:52,06
it was put together by the legal
side of things to put together by.

52
00:04:53,46 --> 00:04:56,79
Tony poor got oh well no lismore solicitor

53
00:04:59,66 --> 00:05:04,16
and it was put together
as a multiple occupancy

54
00:05:05,71 --> 00:05:10,53
and based on the draft of the multiple
occupancy code did come out a few years

55
00:05:11,69 --> 00:05:14,86
before and

56
00:05:14,87 --> 00:05:19,55
that allowed a certain portion
of the land to be ours

57
00:05:19,55 --> 00:05:22,58
and individually with

58
00:05:23,55 --> 00:05:25,24
and the rest held in common

59
00:05:27,26 --> 00:05:32,84
and we'll come back to this later on
however that's the way it was put together

60
00:05:34,12 --> 00:05:39,17
and from the very word go.

61
00:05:40,58 --> 00:05:45,59
We had experienced an awful lot of
trouble with councils settling in.

62
00:05:45,59 --> 00:05:49,28
It seemed to be the state government
saying yes you can do things like this

63
00:05:50,03 --> 00:05:51,66
and the council saying well you can do it

64
00:05:51,66 --> 00:05:56,77
but not really in our backyard in our
backyard even though they had given the

65
00:05:56,78 --> 00:06:01,68
development approval had been given.
And everything was being done.

66
00:06:01,84 --> 00:06:08,43
I'll let peter talk a while for about
that side of the problems with council.

67
00:06:10,34 --> 00:06:14,93
They're virtually a classic
response and they could be study.

68
00:06:14,95 --> 00:06:21,24
They won't be the same we were encouraged
them to hills by by state government.

69
00:06:22,27 --> 00:06:25,01
We were trying to be pushed out
of the hills by local government

70
00:06:25,01 --> 00:06:27,42
and federal government paid
for it all but a whole mess.

71
00:06:28,66 --> 00:06:29,99
It's cost the government a lot of money

72
00:06:29,99 --> 00:06:36,25
and it is basically it's a reflection of
a lack of integration on the level of

73
00:06:36,25 --> 00:06:39,32
government and that is state governments

74
00:06:39,32 --> 00:06:43,80
or the need for people to settle in the
hills to change clapped out farms into

75
00:06:43,80 --> 00:06:47,08
organic paradises to
change been employed used

76
00:06:47,08 --> 00:06:49,50
and to people who built their
own homes in their own assets

77
00:06:50,74 --> 00:06:55,29
and local government didn't want to do
the show in one fact what they did.

78
00:06:57,82 --> 00:07:02,47
A souness as you know i rephrased
it meant a differently

79
00:07:03,68 --> 00:07:07,28
when we did receive the approval.

80
00:07:07,32 --> 00:07:10,51
The major died shortly in that period

81
00:07:11,65 --> 00:07:18,59
and in between the the final lodging of
the application bureaucracy put a request

82
00:07:18,59 --> 00:07:24,18
for they want to 20 year bridge which is
going to cost something like five million

83
00:07:24,18 --> 00:07:29,20
dollars and then said no one can
move on and mr. bridge is build

84
00:07:29,92 --> 00:07:31,80
and so they put as a midi outside the law.

85
00:07:31,86 --> 00:07:36,45
We were illegal occupants of the
land by by design by local council

86
00:07:37,53 --> 00:07:43,19
and from there on it went onto a parade
or a show raid really off of needling

87
00:07:43,19 --> 00:07:44,15
and pastoring

88
00:07:44,15 --> 00:07:50,88
that beggars description from having to
put every tree on the property onto a map

89
00:07:50,88 --> 00:07:55,00
and to what slope the tree would
stand on of what size it would be

90
00:07:55,00 --> 00:07:59,63
and fire hydrants every two metres
and. It was there was a madhouse.

91
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,86
They made us put $25000 in
engineering reports on bits of land

92
00:08:04,86 --> 00:08:06,45
that you know only and

93
00:08:06,45 --> 00:08:11,67
when i look back on those days
the only thing i find incredible

94
00:08:11,67 --> 00:08:15,39
and hard to believe is that
so many of us stuck it out

95
00:08:16,53 --> 00:08:20,59
and out of the very first 20 people who
landed here we still have 15 of them.

96
00:08:21,19 --> 00:08:28,06
And three of the others come back regularly
wishing they hadn't sold up. So it.

97
00:08:29,33 --> 00:08:35,60
It did two things for us. It taught
us how to handle bureaucracy.

98
00:08:38,24 --> 00:08:38,95
It taught us

99
00:08:38,95 --> 00:08:43,57
that sometimes confrontation is necessary

100
00:08:46,10 --> 00:08:53,07
but more than anything else it world
it is together as a group of people

101
00:08:55,33 --> 00:08:58,03
because we've all come from
different walks of our lives.

102
00:08:58,23 --> 00:09:02,89
You know peter had come from brisbane i'd
come from rocky other people many people

103
00:09:02,89 --> 00:09:07,93
had never been on the land and we
were here we because we were illegal.

104
00:09:07,94 --> 00:09:12,58
We couldn't make a row
people were trudging up

105
00:09:12,58 --> 00:09:14,62
and down hills carrying buckets of water.

106
00:09:15,05 --> 00:09:18,00
You know that was quite frightening

107
00:09:19,43 --> 00:09:24,66
and finally i suppose we we
started to feel ourselves in fact

108
00:09:25,99 --> 00:09:29,58
and we started doing a bit of arguing
and doing a bit of construction

109
00:09:29,58 --> 00:09:30,85
and we brought things to a head.

110
00:09:32,94 --> 00:09:38,35
We've had really 10 years of problems with
with local government it was only really

111
00:09:38,35 --> 00:09:43,54
a couple of individuals within the
bureaucracy of the lismore council.

112
00:09:45,14 --> 00:09:48,13
We brought things to such a
head one stage in the game

113
00:09:49,98 --> 00:09:55,24
that person threatened to take us into
court and we said we'd love to see.

114
00:09:57,87 --> 00:09:59,66
Because we publicly he defamed him.

115
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,86
But we didn't we just told the truth about

116
00:10:02,64 --> 00:10:06,93
that time we were called feral youmans
that's the name for it and i know

117
00:10:06,93 --> 00:10:09,38
that i worked with integral rock
to see at that time there was

118
00:10:09,38 --> 00:10:10,90
and then we had feral youmans

119
00:10:11,92 --> 00:10:15,94
and the whole notion of a fourth level
of government which we were here.

120
00:10:16,16 --> 00:10:21,46
We wanted to empower ourselves to make the
decisions about iowa love area about our

121
00:10:21,46 --> 00:10:25,39
roads and not get each and every
decision of local government so

122
00:10:25,40 --> 00:10:31,30
that whole process was alien to the
average bureaucrat thought that that was.

123
00:10:31,32 --> 00:10:35,67
It was a communist. Yes. Bred
to us it wasn't good. To us.

124
00:10:35,74 --> 00:10:38,73
It always was the essence you.

125
00:10:38,81 --> 00:10:42,80
Well you must you must make a new
system which both has capitalism

126
00:10:42,80 --> 00:10:44,67
and communism in it into a numeric.

127
00:10:45,27 --> 00:10:51,08
I myself i'm a green economist and i
get very upset if i see to divide

128
00:10:51,08 --> 00:10:52,17
and rule ethics

129
00:10:52,17 --> 00:10:55,67
that is being done by the major players
which as you are either a commie

130
00:10:55,67 --> 00:11:00,08
or your capital. Grows as a matter of
fact we have these urges are selves.

131
00:11:00,19 --> 00:11:02,92
When it comes to making a stand on our car

132
00:11:02,92 --> 00:11:07,10
or our land you believe you have your
individual rights your preservative if you're

133
00:11:07,10 --> 00:11:09,14
a capitalist. When it comes to the point

134
00:11:09,14 --> 00:11:12,34
that you need a right from a neighbor
certainly you become a communist. You know.

135
00:11:13,58 --> 00:11:18,47
We've got a bit of both and and
i can well see from the eyes.

136
00:11:18,51 --> 00:11:20,23
You do baroque to see that time

137
00:11:21,05 --> 00:11:26,29
that a group of people settling land a
big group a big group of people. Yes.

138
00:11:27,73 --> 00:11:29,98
Creating a and independent

139
00:11:29,98 --> 00:11:34,68
and burnley controlled village was
frightening most frightening.

140
00:11:34,74 --> 00:11:38,06
Yeah i can see that while they were
thinking of going to be hordes of them.

141
00:11:38,10 --> 00:11:42,09
Yeah you know like on the road if we we
thought we were one of the first of many

142
00:11:42,82 --> 00:11:46,35
there was real fears at the time that it
was going to be a swing in the electorate.

143
00:11:47,60 --> 00:11:50,53
Because of these new settlers
being politically on the spectrum

144
00:11:50,53 --> 00:11:53,39
or something like that and in
fact in that actually happened.

145
00:11:53,54 --> 00:11:58,38
The land's released policy of councils today
is based on bringing it up to the land

146
00:11:58,38 --> 00:12:01,28
that brings polluted desirable people.
Then it's never stated like that.

147
00:12:01,31 --> 00:12:02,02
It's just a fact of life

148
00:12:02,02 --> 00:12:05,97
and it's not corruption that's
just how the government works.

149
00:12:05,99 --> 00:12:10,78
Our western system we point at asia saying
those inside look each system has their

150
00:12:10,78 --> 00:12:17,52
own in below the ks so let's get on
what means. Ok we're talking about now.

151
00:12:17,58 --> 00:12:21,85
I suppose 1980 to we got
our approval in september.

152
00:12:23,09 --> 00:12:24,72
Some people moved on straight away.

153
00:12:26,27 --> 00:12:30,32
I didn't actually move on and
till october eighty three.

154
00:12:30,69 --> 00:12:32,95
Because i felt the place
was falling to pieces.

155
00:12:33,58 --> 00:12:37,88
Nothing was at me so i came here
and started to build my house

156
00:12:40,13 --> 00:12:44,79
and within a month three other
houses were going up up until

157
00:12:44,79 --> 00:12:47,65
that time no one was
doing council came round

158
00:12:48,69 --> 00:12:52,96
and stuck these things on our notice
on our doors stop working immediately

159
00:12:52,96 --> 00:12:56,70
and all this bullshit and in
fact they came up here once

160
00:12:57,88 --> 00:13:01,07
and he stood here for about 15
minutes and we were all working away

161
00:13:01,07 --> 00:13:05,63
and no one took the blind but a
notice i finally called out to me

162
00:13:05,63 --> 00:13:07,15
and he said you've got to stop this work.

163
00:13:07,17 --> 00:13:11,59
I said yes my friend when the
roof is on and we've moved in

164
00:13:11,59 --> 00:13:16,95
and it's finished our stop and he got
the same kind of response elsewhere.

165
00:13:17,10 --> 00:13:23,13
It came to a head and they agreed then
to do what the agreement had always been

166
00:13:23,13 --> 00:13:29,15
that we could be a bit of a staged
development we get this we do that we get

167
00:13:29,15 --> 00:13:32,66
that we do that we had 17 conditions here.

168
00:13:34,45 --> 00:13:35,23
I could explain it and

169
00:13:35,23 --> 00:13:41,40
when here you know the motivation
in the minds of the principals was

170
00:13:42,80 --> 00:13:45,57
to to create a model

171
00:13:46,59 --> 00:13:50,97
that can be used by those millions of
unfortunates that are without work

172
00:13:50,97 --> 00:13:56,43
or with our vision. We're living in
a country in a system world wide.

173
00:13:56,77 --> 00:13:59,84
That's still favor for us
pesticides and trucks.

174
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:00,30
Farming

175
00:14:01,62 --> 00:14:07,49
and it has depopulated a real population
from you know like 20 per cent your

176
00:14:07,49 --> 00:14:09,89
farmers to it is now only a few per cent

177
00:14:09,89 --> 00:14:13,91
and those people have an essence gone
to the city and are full of an employed

178
00:14:15,04 --> 00:14:18,96
and we're trying to reverse that and saying
you've got to go into organic farming.

179
00:14:19,06 --> 00:14:23,27
You've got to go into high labour intensity
we must start making labour lovely

180
00:14:23,27 --> 00:14:26,12
again and gardening us healthier
gardening is good for you.

181
00:14:27,18 --> 00:14:29,63
So we were always in that mode of mind.

182
00:14:29,63 --> 00:14:33,77
We had to provide something
that can be used easily

183
00:14:33,77 --> 00:14:35,90
and i think ultimately that's the fight

184
00:14:35,90 --> 00:14:39,29
that was on the height
behind the scenes is

185
00:14:39,29 --> 00:14:46,04
that the establishment for
whatever reason was not ready

186
00:14:46,04 --> 00:14:48,45
to embrace a model

187
00:14:49,18 --> 00:14:52,70
that now is so sorely needed because
how do you settle people on the land.

188
00:14:52,75 --> 00:14:57,41
It didn't work as a multiple occupancy
because the moment to emma was created the

189
00:14:57,41 --> 00:14:58,64
right to withdrawn from it.

190
00:14:58,65 --> 00:15:02,23
You couldn't get a telephone you couldn't
get a first home owners grant you're a

191
00:15:02,23 --> 00:15:06,76
you were a non-citizen in fact you could
be sprayed on by the air because you were

192
00:15:06,76 --> 00:15:10,04
only one farm goes fast and
people didn't exist. Ok.

193
00:15:10,11 --> 00:15:14,52
We became rural residents feel we could
well maybe we should just talk a little bit

194
00:15:14,52 --> 00:15:16,59
more about that. What actually happened.

195
00:15:16,73 --> 00:15:18,41
We've been having all this trouble

196
00:15:18,41 --> 00:15:23,06
and we'd agreed on a stage development
they would give us 10 building permits for

197
00:15:23,06 --> 00:15:29,85
people who were living in bad
conditions here if we did this much of

198
00:15:29,85 --> 00:15:35,49
the same we did that they gave it a few
more did this they gave it so that way

199
00:15:35,49 --> 00:15:39,10
that went through but as we
were coming towards the end of

200
00:15:39,10 --> 00:15:44,64
that one day the planner of the
day a guy called peter rangers

201
00:15:46,22 --> 00:15:48,12
sent us a letter and.

202
00:15:48,76 --> 00:15:54,98
This is to be in 84 85 when the multiple
occupancy code actually came out and

203
00:15:54,99 --> 00:15:59,86
when it came out due to influences
from bodie farm and diamond under the.

204
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,53
He was saying this is all wrong.

205
00:16:01,71 --> 00:16:05,95
Shouldn't be all the land should be held
in common like you know we can all sit

206
00:16:05,95 --> 00:16:06,11
here

207
00:16:06,11 --> 00:16:12,03
and think about buddha together every night
so they actually stuffed up the multiple

208
00:16:12,03 --> 00:16:13,03
occupancy card

209
00:16:14,31 --> 00:16:17,97
and i'm not blaming them they just did
what they thought was the right thing

210
00:16:18,73 --> 00:16:18,75
but

211
00:16:18,75 --> 00:16:23,37
that my we got a letter from this planner
saying within the terms of the multiple

212
00:16:23,37 --> 00:16:27,30
occupancy code you are an illegal
subdivision because we had our own internal

213
00:16:28,30 --> 00:16:30,98
certificate for our to haters

214
00:16:30,98 --> 00:16:34,27
and he said i would suggest
you stay your certificates up

215
00:16:34,27 --> 00:16:37,30
and forget about the boundary.

216
00:16:37,32 --> 00:16:41,69
So that just got right up
my nose for a kickoff.

217
00:16:43,08 --> 00:16:44,59
And there was no leadership at

218
00:16:44,59 --> 00:16:50,37
that moment one leadership group had collapsed
over the failure of the development

219
00:16:50,37 --> 00:16:55,69
plan which was to finish the road
if it didn't get finished and

220
00:16:55,70 --> 00:16:59,34
that development group felt pieces
but some of those people pop forward

221
00:16:59,34 --> 00:17:04,19
and i got involved and we created
what we called illegality crew

222
00:17:05,26 --> 00:17:10,39
and we started with a massive letter
writing campaign to every bureaucrat

223
00:17:10,39 --> 00:17:14,47
and every politician in
federal and state spheres

224
00:17:15,23 --> 00:17:20,51
and writing the most heart rending letters
about our situation here we'd put our

225
00:17:20,51 --> 00:17:24,69
lives in which we had it was all the
truth and now after four years.

226
00:17:25,60 --> 00:17:28,27
We're told we're an illegal subdivision.

227
00:17:29,46 --> 00:17:34,10
So it came to a head actually the day
before the labour government got kicked out

228
00:17:34,10 --> 00:17:39,38
in new south wales one of the last act bob
carr did as environmental minister was

229
00:17:39,39 --> 00:17:45,45
sign a document converting this land
from rural to rural residential

230
00:17:45,45 --> 00:17:52,05
and he threw it right back into the lap
of the lismore city council said right

231
00:17:52,05 --> 00:17:54,28
we've ruled we've rees owned the land

232
00:17:54,28 --> 00:17:56,96
and now you issue them
with some sort of title.

233
00:17:57,83 --> 00:17:59,81
So we ended up with the strata title.

234
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,66
It's not the best way
of doing our community

235
00:18:04,66 --> 00:18:07,69
and it's been a been very
very expensive for us

236
00:18:09,03 --> 00:18:14,17
but as i say we've had a very strong
core group here right from the word go.

237
00:18:14,33 --> 00:18:20,77
And 85 per cent of the people who
have come in since then have

238
00:18:21,90 --> 00:18:23,32
kind of joined that vision.

239
00:18:24,35 --> 00:18:28,66
So we've been extremely lucky we had a
few dissenters every community does

240
00:18:28,66 --> 00:18:32,45
everywhere in the world
but we have very few

241
00:18:33,48 --> 00:18:38,02
and we've just taken a further step forward
now by getting this government money

242
00:18:38,02 --> 00:18:39,82
and undertaking certain things.

243
00:18:40,04 --> 00:18:45,89
So it was the strength of that core
group and it was the first four

244
00:18:45,89 --> 00:18:49,15
or five years with all this
cobblers we had you know right.

245
00:18:49,19 --> 00:18:52,31
Very early in the piece
before anything else.

246
00:18:53,48 --> 00:18:54,82
Some neighbors around here

247
00:18:54,82 --> 00:19:01,43
and some who live nowhere near here on
public money through legal aid took to

248
00:19:01,43 --> 00:19:08,14
lismore city council to court to say
that this shouldn't be allowed to happen

249
00:19:08,14 --> 00:19:12,37
or is a piece of shit in the creek led
by a guy who works for the founder so

250
00:19:12,37 --> 00:19:16,56
security is very scared to having social
security recipients moving next to his

251
00:19:16,56 --> 00:19:18,02
farm. Yes.

252
00:19:18,16 --> 00:19:23,28
So it went down to the environmental
court the land environmental court

253
00:19:23,28 --> 00:19:29,93
and diamond jim was the judge and after
about a three nine months or something.

254
00:19:30,20 --> 00:19:34,39
He finally got the shits didn't he just
said look he said bring this case to an end

255
00:19:34,39 --> 00:19:35,97
tomorrow is i'm sick of it

256
00:19:35,97 --> 00:19:39,13
but almost every one of these for you
know it almost killed it nearly killed us

257
00:19:40,03 --> 00:19:45,79
nearly killed us and they did it all
on legal aid cost us forty five grand.

258
00:19:47,27 --> 00:19:50,16
Eighty four. And i think eighty four.

259
00:19:50,62 --> 00:19:54,57
Sorry and i say to you three three eighty
three eighty three thousand eighty two.

260
00:19:54,59 --> 00:19:59,86
The beginning of the year and you know
we got our approval in september.

261
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,22
And final approval in september 80 to
this was in january. Eighty three.

262
00:20:05,38 --> 00:20:07,83
This was the first thing
we had to end counter.

263
00:20:07,99 --> 00:20:12,40
However as i say that there
were about 10 people involved.

264
00:20:12,74 --> 00:20:15,93
They had time to build a group. Yes
it was wrong girl a core group.

265
00:20:16,56 --> 00:20:23,47
So the adversity was good for them.
I tell you bout how i was living.

266
00:20:24,87 --> 00:20:28,04
So i've been were i was well
i've come down from rocky

267
00:20:28,86 --> 00:20:30,08
but nothing was happening here.

268
00:20:30,29 --> 00:20:35,03
So i had a job to do in lismore
and i was living indonesian

269
00:20:35,03 --> 00:20:38,55
and i come over every weekend and
come over board meetings and stuff

270
00:20:39,87 --> 00:20:43,94
and i could sense. Nothing
was happening and i.

271
00:20:44,28 --> 00:20:47,62
We knew by then the court case
was on i went down as a witness

272
00:20:49,14 --> 00:20:56,06
and i said to my wife
could you stand living

273
00:20:56,06 --> 00:20:57,91
in a tent. Bearing in mind.

274
00:20:58,27 --> 00:21:04,79
She was 53 years of age you know we
bought a marquee tent which we still use

275
00:21:04,79 --> 00:21:08,14
at bill and cliffs on functions and things

276
00:21:08,87 --> 00:21:13,22
that was out there where my car is.

277
00:21:13,24 --> 00:21:19,23
And i our son jason and his friend richard
and our daughter zoe lived in that tent.

278
00:21:19,39 --> 00:21:22,55
We had hot food and we
had a fridge in there

279
00:21:23,88 --> 00:21:28,58
and so he went to school looking clean every
day shoes to bathe in the wheelbarrow

280
00:21:30,41 --> 00:21:34,48
it. We're just about got
ready to have our roof up

281
00:21:34,48 --> 00:21:37,62
and i had a drunken
accident in my motor car.

282
00:21:38,98 --> 00:21:40,41
I turned my motor car over

283
00:21:42,53 --> 00:21:49,17
and i do it was a big beautiful toyota land
cruiser i'd always intended to sell it

284
00:21:49,17 --> 00:21:53,67
to finish the house but it
took me about three months

285
00:21:53,67 --> 00:21:57,54
or four months to get the money
together to get the repairs done so

286
00:21:57,54 --> 00:21:58,52
that i could sell it.

287
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,66
So yeah it took us 10 months

288
00:22:04,67 --> 00:22:09,45
and in 10 months we had this locked up
here was ready to move to no wall just the

289
00:22:09,45 --> 00:22:14,00
roof on the wall. We had
our big tent under here.

290
00:22:14,02 --> 00:22:17,12
And my young daughter had
a little tent over here

291
00:22:17,12 --> 00:22:21,36
and we used to sleep up in the lot. Then
we got that one down and gradually.

292
00:22:21,65 --> 00:22:23,64
Well two years.

293
00:22:24,08 --> 00:22:30,62
Basically we had basic house
we just improved a little bit.

294
00:22:30,64 --> 00:22:37,45
I was just moving in from existing executive
post in brisbane doing an opening

295
00:22:37,45 --> 00:22:38,59
night apartment

296
00:22:38,59 --> 00:22:42,78
and i really wanted to get away from
anything to do with civilization so i walked

297
00:22:42,78 --> 00:22:47,94
in buckets for years and i was more
interested in a sitting in a rain

298
00:22:47,94 --> 00:22:48,70
and sitting inside.

299
00:22:49,07 --> 00:22:53,24
I'm still building my house after
10 years getting there slowly

300
00:22:54,31 --> 00:22:59,12
but i've done lots of other things.
Oh yeah i've put my total time here.

301
00:22:59,14 --> 00:23:05,62
That's a different. Carry on world
the thing is how did you do it.

302
00:23:05,62 --> 00:23:12,42
I i i think you got to have a certain
philosophical foundation to do it.

303
00:23:12,43 --> 00:23:17,63
You must either be a grassroots worshipper
that wants to you know improve nature

304
00:23:17,63 --> 00:23:22,80
or have some such compassion to
actually do it and i believe now

305
00:23:22,80 --> 00:23:28,97
that land should be settled not like like
like i did i don't think it is for public

306
00:23:28,97 --> 00:23:32,25
consumption i think it's not many can do
it in fact that's one of many people are

307
00:23:32,25 --> 00:23:35,18
doing it is beautiful

308
00:23:35,18 --> 00:23:39,11
and it certainly made me love the
country more than i ever could.

309
00:23:39,40 --> 00:23:40,72
You know stepping away from

310
00:23:41,58 --> 00:23:45,71
that cage of civilization out there
amongst the ticks in the mosquitoes and

311
00:23:45,71 --> 00:23:46,77
and the snakes

312
00:23:47,80 --> 00:23:51,54
but nowadays i favour a mode where you
have a little cabin to start with

313
00:23:52,52 --> 00:23:58,08
and work on from there but
therefore can be accessed by a.

314
00:23:58,60 --> 00:24:04,93
Less adventurous. Started. Yes.

315
00:24:06,52 --> 00:24:12,23
There was a divorce several different
philosophies i think operating at the time i

316
00:24:12,24 --> 00:24:17,12
don't think any of us are really aware what
all the philosophies were prevalent in

317
00:24:17,12 --> 00:24:19,52
people's minds we service soon
they were all but the same

318
00:24:19,52 --> 00:24:23,35
but there weren't there was a very strong
group of people who were just want to

319
00:24:23,35 --> 00:24:29,36
build a beautiful organic garden and
there were those people who are into.

320
00:24:29,38 --> 00:24:31,14
Celebrating the low cost of the land.

321
00:24:31,78 --> 00:24:35,74
And belinda own home the home builders
and their distinct lifestyle.

322
00:24:35,83 --> 00:24:39,14
The home builders and it was a
nice home and rudimentary gardens

323
00:24:39,14 --> 00:24:44,24
and the gardens had mostly beautiful
gardens and smaller cabins.

324
00:24:44,98 --> 00:24:50,65
There also was a sufficient large
group of people who were the

325
00:24:51,90 --> 00:24:58,07
if you wish the outcasts of a modern
society who run into trouble emotionally

326
00:24:58,08 --> 00:25:01,50
mentally or financially in that
big thing called the system

327
00:25:01,50 --> 00:25:08,30
and came to push for refuge very much still
a part of our lifestyle is to actually

328
00:25:08,30 --> 00:25:13,08
have compassion for those those people.

329
00:25:13,10 --> 00:25:13,78
Nevertheless

330
00:25:13,78 --> 00:25:17,55
that creates problems of its own because
you have to start thinking for people like

331
00:25:17,55 --> 00:25:20,97
that after you've got it and projecting
much as a leadership to make

332
00:25:20,97 --> 00:25:23,60
and part of it. So one of the things

333
00:25:23,60 --> 00:25:30,05
that was the most important to me i
find myself shifting from a very

334
00:25:30,05 --> 00:25:30,61
well-paid

335
00:25:30,61 --> 00:25:37,34
and satisfactory position
in government to a non-paid

336
00:25:37,34 --> 00:25:39,68
position which i was very proud

337
00:25:39,68 --> 00:25:43,04
and happy with actually transforming
the world in a little way in time

338
00:25:43,04 --> 00:25:48,05
and making a contribution to something
you know i think that the main battle

339
00:25:48,05 --> 00:25:54,56
that we have now in is trying to make a
sorrow to reassess the meaning of what were

340
00:25:56,16 --> 00:25:59,60
you see and we have been successful
leader in a couple of minor ways.

341
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:06,81
Already we we have made various
groups understand the only

342
00:26:06,81 --> 00:26:09,88
day to day judge work if you get paid by

343
00:26:10,86 --> 00:26:14,43
but you know there's a lot of work done
which people don't get paid for we do a lot

344
00:26:14,43 --> 00:26:21,01
of work here voluntarily we maintain
our own roads and all that and.

345
00:26:21,03 --> 00:26:25,29
So yeah that's what we're working on now
is trying to get a reassessment of the

346
00:26:25,29 --> 00:26:30,94
meaning of words like to say
something there at the time

347
00:26:30,94 --> 00:26:32,33
that we are starting maybe a year

348
00:26:32,33 --> 00:26:36,71
or two after another development try
to sway here called melbourne springs

349
00:26:36,71 --> 00:26:41,30
and they were very orderly very order they
were calling for carpenters new cancer

350
00:26:41,30 --> 00:26:46,33
plumbers there were really trying to
structure a model society whereas we didn't

351
00:26:46,33 --> 00:26:50,00
have no such choice we just took anybody
you know want to come into effect

352
00:26:51,13 --> 00:26:56,37
melbourne springs failed because of all
organisation where we succeeded because in

353
00:26:56,37 --> 00:26:59,19
the end i became the statistic
planning for this village.

354
00:26:59,41 --> 00:27:01,50
John became the trainer
for the village the

355
00:27:01,50 --> 00:27:03,75
or the grower can you're going
to grow over the village dick

356
00:27:03,75 --> 00:27:06,21
and the machine member came the.

357
00:27:06,23 --> 00:27:07,53
The road builder for the village

358
00:27:07,53 --> 00:27:12,63
and strangely enough in a lot of people
who thought they had a skill in one way.

359
00:27:12,78 --> 00:27:17,97
In fact coming to live here has developed
a skill it another way we have a

360
00:27:17,97 --> 00:27:23,21
shoemaker here who really wants
to be a bad guitar maker.

361
00:27:23,23 --> 00:27:28,76
But he makes shoes you know
fearful issues like iran so.

362
00:27:28,78 --> 00:27:30,60
I just made a threat is known

363
00:27:30,60 --> 00:27:35,29
when i realized we were different from the
other communities in a way is now coming

364
00:27:35,29 --> 00:27:38,90
to fruition in a true sense not just
legally because of the documentation

365
00:27:38,90 --> 00:27:43,42
but because we had learned to
get a so much over this period

366
00:27:43,42 --> 00:27:47,43
and found solace in you for the strength
and we acted like a company more and more.

367
00:27:48,21 --> 00:27:53,01
Finally we could sit down amongst ourselves
and saying what the hell is going on.

368
00:27:53,37 --> 00:27:59,48
Why are all of us sitting here being
basically kept in poverty by.

369
00:28:01,07 --> 00:28:05,78
The lack of work being available here
we are positioned in a place here.

370
00:28:05,88 --> 00:28:10,66
How do we go of it. We took stock
of our skills from society

371
00:28:11,66 --> 00:28:15,95
and those skills we developed ourselves
in the interim like mud brick building

372
00:28:15,95 --> 00:28:17,00
and let glassing

373
00:28:17,00 --> 00:28:22,67
and stand sort of cementing the sergeant
bushwalking dam building all these things

374
00:28:23,54 --> 00:28:26,02
and we went to get it and
we looked at our place here

375
00:28:26,02 --> 00:28:32,15
and we said look we are living here on
a national park quality bit of land

376
00:28:32,15 --> 00:28:37,03
and we are selves our rehabilitating
into a world heritage reserve.

377
00:28:38,38 --> 00:28:44,14
We've got the infrastructure to
become teachers of this guilt

378
00:28:45,15 --> 00:28:48,83
and we've got the skills and we built
the teaching around our common skills

379
00:28:48,83 --> 00:28:52,65
and with the taking stock of a village
which i think is unique in australia

380
00:28:52,65 --> 00:28:55,37
but actually this fourth level
government looking at itself

381
00:28:55,37 --> 00:28:59,29
and saying what can we do years
to solve australia's problems

382
00:29:00,65 --> 00:29:05,41
and here close by now we're not getting
into the commercial development stage we're

383
00:29:05,41 --> 00:29:09,20
starting to talk about common growing we're
time to do this just in this hall which

384
00:29:09,20 --> 00:29:14,77
is happening here. In the getting to know.
Major building programs on right now.

385
00:29:14,91 --> 00:29:20,60
And by the end of next year we will have
completed by the middle of this coming.

386
00:29:20,70 --> 00:29:25,31
Ninety three in one year we would have
completed two major buildings i don't know

387
00:29:25,31 --> 00:29:28,85
if you saw the one wrapped up in black
plastic that's going to be the most

388
00:29:28,85 --> 00:29:31,72
magnificent. To building on three levels

389
00:29:34,91 --> 00:29:41,76
and are the building is quite magnificent
and that's all done on voluntary labour.

390
00:29:41,90 --> 00:29:44,92
So.

391
00:29:46,25 --> 00:29:51,03
People do work. Now.

392
00:29:52,56 --> 00:29:57,61
So. Much.

393
00:29:57,63 --> 00:30:03,73
Welter has been a major part. If bill and
chris could not a billion kids. Sorry.

394
00:30:03,74 --> 00:30:04,33
You know.

395
00:30:05,89 --> 00:30:12,62
Okay without we don't i don't consider
welfare welfare ice arms to the old school i

396
00:30:12,62 --> 00:30:13,58
believe that social security.

397
00:30:15,65 --> 00:30:22,51
So we have about a third of the
people here who have their

398
00:30:22,51 --> 00:30:24,16
own money from one source

399
00:30:24,16 --> 00:30:30,21
or another about a third of our
people are on some sort of pension

400
00:30:32,11 --> 00:30:35,31
and we have about a third
of the people unemployed

401
00:30:36,40 --> 00:30:42,08
that has been the way this was
designed this village was designed for

402
00:30:44,17 --> 00:30:50,51
low income earners to come here and go
down and that was based on the fact

403
00:30:50,51 --> 00:30:54,84
that they were on the dole and they
could get the first homeowners.

404
00:30:55,03 --> 00:30:57,47
Grant and things like that.

405
00:30:58,27 --> 00:31:00,98
Now we've got no worries about

406
00:31:00,98 --> 00:31:05,71
that because we have a hundred fifteen
families living in this valley

407
00:31:05,71 --> 00:31:07,90
that couldn't maintain one farmer

408
00:31:07,90 --> 00:31:15,45
and three hundred cows
out of those people the

409
00:31:15,46 --> 00:31:15,61
ones

410
00:31:15,61 --> 00:31:22,65
that are here now are virtually
becoming they're on the verge of

411
00:31:23,93 --> 00:31:29,58
wanting to earn class something and
yes. One of the reasons why the was.

412
00:31:29,96 --> 00:31:31,25
So security dependent.
