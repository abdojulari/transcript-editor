1
00:00:18,14 --> 00:00:24,54
And in the time they turned to find the
tweezers to tug of the ticket from the tip

2
00:00:24,54 --> 00:00:25,68
of their dick.

3
00:00:26,71 --> 00:00:27,36
They had children

4
00:00:27,36 --> 00:00:32,89
and children's children they grew
a coat of many colors about them

5
00:00:32,89 --> 00:00:39,35
that waxed in the old wave of
their waning aquarian waters

6
00:00:40,19 --> 00:00:42,15
that washed and fed divvied child

7
00:00:42,15 --> 00:00:48,56
that poured the life in the day
of a day in the life of an inn

8
00:00:55,18 --> 00:01:01,06
in my village in ratted
hair and proud rags.

9
00:01:01,38 --> 00:01:05,90
There are dead stop travellers
wrapped in concrete.

They drive on up from the city of yup

and young barefoot woman
with suckling babes. Mrs.

94
00:08:37,52 --> 00:08:44,38
No bras and mr battered cars
to see a life that's free.

95
00:08:44,40 --> 00:08:50,70
Free love free drugs free music
free footpath free gatta

They walk the town all city
fled for a bit of a dare.

99
00:09:03,20 --> 00:09:07,74
But then they're scared their culture
shocked their culture locked

100
00:09:07,74 --> 00:09:14,38
and in the mind of travel their ships
dry docked for their clothes away

101
00:09:14,38 --> 00:09:19,79
in their shoes so bright this skin is white
their teeth their white their car is

102
00:09:19,79 --> 00:09:24,81
nice and their kids like mice with
heavy metal megadeth sweatshirt hype.

103
00:09:25,06 --> 00:09:30,23
They window shop but they smell the pot.
They sniff the calf. But they don't stop.

104
00:09:31,09 --> 00:09:37,34
No cash or coins bulge their fashion lines
for their credit card is raise a fine.

105
00:09:37,41 --> 00:09:42,23
It cuts a slice they can call
mine simply divine and it's mine.

106
00:09:43,06 --> 00:09:49,54
They ask where are the real hippies
in their maya we say standing on one

107
00:09:49,54 --> 00:09:53,75
sire is that chap really
chained to a dog and his mate.

00:10:07,17 --> 00:10:12,35
Or dead. But cammy easter
bunnies on a crucifixion dawn

111
00:10:12,35 --> 00:10:19,07
when nailing chocolate coated junkies
onto crosses so forlorn not with nails

112
00:10:19,07 --> 00:10:25,50
but syringes and not for a soft heart
freak show cringes but for the crowd

113
00:10:25,50 --> 00:10:29,89
and the cameras and the
mums and dads and kids.

114
00:10:29,91 --> 00:10:36,08
Tunnel vision unscrews from their third
eye it guides them safe back to their car

115
00:10:36,08 --> 00:10:38,63
by by.

116
00:10:38,65 --> 00:10:44,10
We dust their footprints from our
face climb down from the cross

117
00:10:44,10 --> 00:10:45,56
and clean up the place.

118
00:10:46,75 --> 00:10:52,84
Barry hoses shopkeepers sweep and scavengers
the lick nuggets from the street.

119
00:10:54,23 --> 00:11:01,06
The streets of nimbin aligned with mud
over gold lined with a purple green

120
00:11:01,06 --> 00:11:05,27
we need that's worth as gold with peace.

121
00:11:05,81 --> 00:11:11,01
And guns and plenty and poverty and law

122
00:11:12,60 --> 00:11:15,24
and anarchy come and say

123
00:11:17,13 --> 00:11:23,51
or better still piss off.

124
00:11:24,79 --> 00:11:30,45
It was written in october
1986 nimbin razor mirror.

125
00:11:32,23 --> 00:11:38,93
It was a town where we used to love
each other in the streets in the

126
00:11:38,93 --> 00:11:44,03
park in the rain but to hug
and hold and massaged.

127
00:11:44,05 --> 00:11:46,40
Some say no it wasn't it was never

128
00:11:46,40 --> 00:11:52,88
that even before the smack attack
the sharp edge was there axe blade

129
00:11:52,88 --> 00:11:59,77
wedge saw plough brush cutter
knife a century of timber

130
00:11:59,77 --> 00:12:00,14
cut. Yet as

131
00:12:00,14 --> 00:12:06,87
and came carter's lismore was a two day
hike before they wipe the red cedar from

132
00:12:06,87 --> 00:12:10,97
their path wildmen few women two wars.

133
00:12:11,50 --> 00:12:18,35
A depression isolation a recession of
one industry decaying into the next

134
00:12:19,55 --> 00:12:23,10
the hills strewn with the bones of trees

135
00:12:23,10 --> 00:12:27,58
and beef in dairy till
the town was near goes.

136
00:12:27,60 --> 00:12:30,86
And the valley was ripe for the hippy.

137
00:12:32,13 --> 00:12:37,87
Then came the word and the word was a
goth smiling down check and benefits

138
00:12:37,87 --> 00:12:40,18
and grants a festival

139
00:12:40,18 --> 00:12:47,03
that still life born again mushroomed
pregnant on astroturf the deliberately

140
00:12:47,03 --> 00:12:53,55
poor became multiple occupants booming
babies building broken families building the

141
00:12:53,55 --> 00:13:00,15
house the trees rebuilding the car rewinding
relationships through a hassle of hope

142
00:13:00,15 --> 00:13:06,79
and rip off. The dropkicks of
drew and. And strange dropouts.

143
00:13:07,37 --> 00:13:13,70
Feeding friendship through a slot machine
the sweetness turns savory savvy

144
00:13:14,53 --> 00:13:21,36
one streetwise in the mirror of the
knife the mirror of the needle words

145
00:13:21,37 --> 00:13:28,19
and eyes can still cut the rusted blade
rests cold on the cheek of the valley

146
00:13:29,61 --> 00:13:31,33
and we who used to love.

147
00:13:31,50 --> 00:13:34,88
We are the spit and whetstone honing

148
00:13:34,88 --> 00:13:41,43
that blade losing each other into
the raised history of the valley.

149
00:13:42,87 --> 00:13:46,46
Only we can sheath the anger

150
00:13:47,61 --> 00:13:51,92
and the knife.

151
00:13:51,94 --> 00:13:57,25
I keep going.

152
00:13:57,27 --> 00:13:59,06
Rainbow rabbit.

153
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,57
Mary go around the forest dusty hippies
while dreaming caravans watching

154
00:14:06,57 --> 00:14:12,75
compost walls and the logging trucks
roll past flapping plastic wind.

155
00:14:12,98 --> 00:14:15,82
Beast turns turtle.

156
00:14:16,42 --> 00:14:23,15
Turns based turns bored in a
heartbeat changing channels changing

157
00:14:23,16 --> 00:14:28,93
tires in a mud to grumble
seed planting a jungle board.

158
00:14:30,06 --> 00:14:33,99
Beginning that rainbow rabbit.

159
00:14:34,01 --> 00:14:40,76
Merry go round the forest dusty
hippies while dreaming caravans

160
00:14:41,61 --> 00:14:43,40

past flapping plastic wind as.

162
00:14:49,19 --> 00:14:53,69
Beast turns turtle turns beast.

163
00:14:54,21 --> 00:15:01,00
Turns bored in a heartbeat changing
channels changing tires in a

164
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:07,57
mad grumble seed planting a jungle
bog nit picking snake skin ticks

165
00:15:07,57 --> 00:15:11,61
below fly below and
helicopters sniffing drugs.

166
00:15:12,10 --> 00:15:18,35
Paradise bird startle waving at a
sunset showers the last rainbow

167
00:15:18,35 --> 00:15:23,51
fades the mountain and
twilight crashes the valley.

168
00:15:23,53 --> 00:15:29,89
Fresh dripping terraces of flowers
and greens marie is in tune.

169
00:15:30,72 --> 00:15:34,96
The car breaks down the town
wakes up friday driving drink

170
00:15:34,96 --> 00:15:39,74
and drugs forest wetbacks
rural debutantes dogface

171
