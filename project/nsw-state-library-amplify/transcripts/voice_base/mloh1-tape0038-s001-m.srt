1
00:00:03,46 --> 00:00:05,44
It's see robertson who was

2
00:00:05,44 --> 00:00:09,83
a public works engineer during the building
of the sydney harbour bridge. Do you

3
00:00:09,83 --> 00:00:15,39
remember how you first got the job working
in the public works on the bridge. Yes i

4
00:00:16,68 --> 00:00:22,01
spoke to professor chapman of the university
of adelaide who was my all professor

5
00:00:23,25 --> 00:00:27,71
and i asked him about the possibility of

6
00:00:28,90 --> 00:00:35,08
a job. And he told me that dr
bradfield had just advertised for

7
00:00:35,08 --> 00:00:41,56
draftsman to work. Checking the
design of the sydney harbor bridge

8
00:00:42,50 --> 00:00:48,84
. And suggested that i might
write to him which i did

9
00:00:50,49 --> 00:00:55,45
and you get word back from don't read through
yes i got word back from i don't know

10
00:00:55,45 --> 00:01:00,42
where that was written by dr bradfield
just by his secretary who was kathleen

11
00:01:00,42 --> 00:01:06,81
butler. But any case i got a letter
back from him and told me that dr.

12
00:01:06,81 --> 00:01:12,06
Bradfield would be at the wind chill
in melbourne on such and such

13
00:01:12,06 --> 00:01:18,82
a saturday morning and he would interview
me then and i do course i went over to

14
00:01:18,82 --> 00:01:25,15
melbourne having borrowed the
money from my mother. And

15
00:01:25,15 --> 00:01:29,92
doctor bradford interviewed me. I can't
remember whether he told me at that time

16
00:01:29,92 --> 00:01:33,71
was i had the job or not but the
new case i subsequently received

17
00:01:33,71 --> 00:01:38,86
a notice to say that i
would be employed as

18
00:01:38,86 --> 00:01:45,82
a draftsman. In those days we weren't
engineers we were all draftsman and i

19
00:01:45,83 --> 00:01:51,57
went over to sydney and started about the
beginning of november. I think nineteen

20
00:01:51,57 --> 00:01:58,25
twenty five. No it's fairly accurate and
do you remember what stage the bridge

21
00:01:58,25 --> 00:02:02,28
preparations that got to then the
contract had been let hadn't it. Oh yes.

22
00:02:02,30 --> 00:02:08,44
Constructing the bridge at that stage and
some of the approach bands on the south

23
00:02:08,44 --> 00:02:15,30
side if i remember rightly were.
Almost i think in position one or

24
00:02:15,30 --> 00:02:22,15
one or two of them. I'm not sure about
that but certainly the work had

25
00:02:22,15 --> 00:02:28,94
was well advanced. That stage was no
question but they were proceeding

26
00:02:29,95 --> 00:02:32,50
in the workshops was

27
00:02:32,51 --> 00:02:36,83
a fabrication. Do you member who you worked
under and what it was like in the works

28
00:02:36,83 --> 00:02:43,54
in the drawing office and then yes the
principled engineer i think he was

29
00:02:43,54 --> 00:02:47,27
called was gordon stuckey and

30
00:02:47,27 --> 00:02:53,20
a very clever chap by the way. He was

31
00:02:55,10 --> 00:03:01,95
very good at giving in your instructions
are very good at doing. His

32
00:03:01,95 --> 00:03:06,63
own calculations as well and i gather that
he was one of the leading lights that.

33
00:03:06,90 --> 00:03:12,99
That helped stop the bradfield prepare his
design of an arch on which the tenders

34
00:03:12,99 --> 00:03:19,66
were based as well as of course the
cantilever bridge and do you remember what so

35
00:03:19,66 --> 00:03:24,81
what was your job you were checking the
doormen long that in fact ralph freeman's

36
00:03:24,81 --> 00:03:29,38
office is figures at that stage where you
where we received what we received were

37
00:03:30,12 --> 00:03:37,01
blueprints of various parts of the
structure that's first stage.

38
00:03:37,15 --> 00:03:43,60
The prince of the approach spans and
my first job was to track some of the.

39
00:03:44,80 --> 00:03:49,80
Designs. Well i had to go
over the drawings to get the

40
00:03:53,41 --> 00:03:58,78
trick to get the dimensions of the various
parts of the birch this particular

41
00:03:58,78 --> 00:04:05,21
approach banderas i worked
on and then in light of the

42
00:04:05,21 --> 00:04:11,70
specification check whether any of the
parts were overstressed or not. And

43
00:04:12,77 --> 00:04:19,70
so not many of them were they were all
pretty right. Did you get any into

44
00:04:19,71 --> 00:04:26,47
that argument which they had over how
many. How many good as they would be

45
00:04:26,47 --> 00:04:33,43
in the approach spans there between
britt field and freeman. No

46
00:04:33,44 --> 00:04:40,41
you know i had nothing to do with
that. Past that point in this and

47
00:04:40,41 --> 00:04:43,80
the spans were already
designed to the half below yes

48
00:04:49,82 --> 00:04:53,32
i suppose you might say seeing that they
were being erected my work and checking

49
00:04:53,32 --> 00:04:54,17
some of that was

50
00:04:54,17 --> 00:05:01,17
a fairly academic. But i think. If i can
rightly know it was some of the parts

51
00:05:01,17 --> 00:05:05,93
which actually hadn't been done so it
might or might not have been but. Shortly

52
00:05:05,93 --> 00:05:12,64
after that we received some of the
drawings of the main arch and then there's

53
00:05:12,64 --> 00:05:19,57
was we started checking
those and i think they were

54
00:05:19,57 --> 00:05:20,28
what we were called

55
00:05:20,28 --> 00:05:27,23
a. What they're not stage two

56
00:05:29,12 --> 00:05:34,38
there were several design spread out in
the variations of the design of the arch

57
00:05:35,25 --> 00:05:40,73
and one which we started that i started
on was number two. And there were

58
00:05:40,73 --> 00:05:45,54
a number of points about that which
we found were overstressed slightly

59
00:05:45,55 --> 00:05:52,16
overstressed generally and. This
was sent back to dorman long and

60
00:05:53,40 --> 00:06:00,01
amended it and the next set we
got was rushed for the fourth

61
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:05,55
trial that this first trial second trial
was the one we worked on first of all and

62
00:06:05,55 --> 00:06:09,86
then the third trial we never saw but the
next one that came was the fourth trial

63
00:06:09,86 --> 00:06:15,14
and this we checked finally and the script
was no more while actually we were still

64
00:06:15,14 --> 00:06:16,72
checking and when the bridge was opened.

65
00:06:23,12 --> 00:06:28,34
That was certainly academic
there wasn't that dr.

66
00:06:28,34 --> 00:06:29,09
Redfield as

67
00:06:29,09 --> 00:06:35,34
a bird but i will amount of checking that
we were doing at that stage was it was

68
00:06:35,34 --> 00:06:41,55
a minor and mainly on.
Details which we felt

69
00:06:42,80 --> 00:06:48,60
for the sake of the record should should
be finished off for for lay people

70
00:06:49,80 --> 00:06:55,92
who wouldn't understand that this
significance of the calculations. If i am as

71
00:06:55,92 --> 00:06:58,44
a layperson but also with some
engineering knowledge but not

72
00:06:58,44 --> 00:07:04,86
a qualified engineer i understand it that
at the time the an arch steel arch in

73
00:07:04,86 --> 00:07:09,19
that situation is what is known as an
indeterminate structure in that if you change

74
00:07:09,19 --> 00:07:13,35
anything in the design the calculations
are going to start all over again because

75
00:07:13,36 --> 00:07:17,37
it changes everything is that right is
that's practically the case although

76
00:07:18,18 --> 00:07:19,84
a minor change would only make

77
00:07:19,84 --> 00:07:25,94
a small change in most
of the structure but

78
00:07:27,75 --> 00:07:34,61
in effect. We found that some
of the. In this second trial.

79
00:07:34,85 --> 00:07:39,90
Some of the members down here.
The spring. That's down is

80
00:07:39,90 --> 00:07:46,76
a pin supported the arch was slightly
overstressed and various other places

81
00:07:46,76 --> 00:07:53,58
they were these were amended in the
in the fourth trial and most of the

82
00:07:53,58 --> 00:07:59,73
checking of that was done before the arch

83
00:07:59,73 --> 00:08:06,15
was actually very far
advanced but during the.

84
00:08:06,17 --> 00:08:12,26
Design work we also checked out the
stresses that each stage of the erection

85
00:08:12,26 --> 00:08:18,70
because the stresses were different
and in some cases where the

86
00:08:18,70 --> 00:08:24,82
fact that what you call the top cord where
that would have been in the members and

87
00:08:24,82 --> 00:08:27,47
compression that is under

88
00:08:27,48 --> 00:08:34,27
a compression stress during
erection. They were hundred tension

89
00:08:34,27 --> 00:08:40,01
stress and these had to be checked. So at
each stage we also checked not only the

90
00:08:40,01 --> 00:08:45,95
final design but also the final condition
of the design that's when you know it was

91
00:08:45,95 --> 00:08:52,89
completed and when and of course also before
the deck went on. We also checked the

92
00:08:52,90 --> 00:08:59,60
stresses the arches were going up and of
course in that case you not only had the

93
00:08:59,60 --> 00:09:05,69
tension you had the weight of the erection
equipment including the big so called

94
00:09:05,69 --> 00:09:12,56
cranes which were hundred twenty. I think
one hundred fifty tonne i think they saw

95
00:09:12,56 --> 00:09:18,50
which was now that there were nearly 600
tons or maybe i'm wrong. There is 580 i

96
00:09:18,50 --> 00:09:22,82
thought something like it might. I'm probably
wrong. I mixed it up with another one

97
00:09:22,82 --> 00:09:29,45
other thing i was interested also. Not
only for the for the bridge but in the

98
00:09:29,45 --> 00:09:35,56
public works office there where you were
you were on the third floor you remember

99
00:09:35,57 --> 00:09:41,92
where you where the drawing office was might
have been the search floor. You don't

100
00:09:41,92 --> 00:09:45,82
remember much about that. Oh i remember
it but whether it was the third floor or

101
00:09:45,82 --> 00:09:49,92
the fourth or the certainly was
more than the second there was

102
00:09:49,92 --> 00:09:54,91
a third floor anyway that whether you're
i think they were all on one floor

103
00:09:54,91 --> 00:10:01,11
bradfield were true officers
there drawing officers one

104
00:10:01,12 --> 00:10:07,01
contained staff which started off well

105
00:10:07,89 --> 00:10:12,28
originally i think there were only three
or four of us and gordon stuckey.

106
00:10:15,98 --> 00:10:22,67
Jimmy holt afterwards.
James and powers who

107
00:10:22,68 --> 00:10:25,89
died about. I think about

108
00:10:25,89 --> 00:10:32,45
a year ago. But let everything go i think
not sure about that anyway. Then there

109
00:10:33,25 --> 00:10:39,52
was no other. Draughtsman tracer and.

110
00:10:40,81 --> 00:10:45,21
Well when i shortly afterwards the staff
increased and we moved to another office

111
00:10:46,13 --> 00:10:51,67
overlooking. Yes the
flats. And in that office.

112
00:10:53,46 --> 00:10:57,70
Finally there would have been about eight
of us all trackings of various portions

113
00:10:58,66 --> 00:11:05,61
of the design and next to
that it was the office where

114
00:11:07,53 --> 00:11:12,96
lush had his staff he was their protest
wasn't he. He was doing the approaches.

115
00:11:13,07 --> 00:11:19,61
They were actually designing the process
originally we were only checking and

116
00:11:20,68 --> 00:11:27,67
included in their staff was. A number of

117
00:11:27,67 --> 00:11:34,31
engineers who subsequently.
Came over to the main

118
00:11:34,31 --> 00:11:40,31
roads as well as. Ones
several health staff

119
00:11:41,38 --> 00:11:47,70
one or two of them went up to brisbane and
one. Engineer who designed that almost

120
00:11:47,70 --> 00:11:52,70
that's steel arch which they took down for
the more than approach was the railway

121
00:11:52,70 --> 00:11:58,63
never used but which the tramways used and
subsequently became also used by either

122
00:11:59,36 --> 00:12:06,32
for the cars. The designer of that
bridge. Joins don't know where

123
00:12:06,32 --> 00:12:11,36
they joined the firm or estada for consulting
engineers and brisbane and i met him

124
00:12:11,36 --> 00:12:16,93
subsequently up there because no in
davies that was. Cardno and davies as

125
00:12:16,93 --> 00:12:23,23
a consultant and i think you desire died
since. Tell me with the. When you first

126
00:12:23,23 --> 00:12:28,22
started where you were working we were hired
by for the public works department or

127
00:12:28,22 --> 00:12:31,16
for the railways. That's rather

128
00:12:31,16 --> 00:12:37,70
a curious thing because both the sydney
harbour bridge and the approaches

129
00:12:38,58 --> 00:12:42,89
were all worked under
the railways and i was

130
00:12:42,89 --> 00:12:49,82
a railway ploy. And as such
i had the privileges which

131
00:12:49,82 --> 00:12:55,67
the railways employers
had. That included one.

132
00:12:56,46 --> 00:13:01,81
Interstate railways pass every
year. And one all lines

133
00:13:03,50 --> 00:13:07,45
. Railways pass here. And

134
00:13:07,45 --> 00:13:12,91
a number of prevent what they call privilege
passes on the railways which. I don't

135
00:13:12,91 --> 00:13:16,10
know how many there were i might have been
only three of two or three of them. I

136
00:13:16,10 --> 00:13:19,94
can't remember how many layers there were
you might better find that out but anyway

137
00:13:21,81 --> 00:13:28,42
these enabled you to travel on the railways
certain times. Usually in your holidays

138
00:13:28,42 --> 00:13:28,96
and you had

139
00:13:28,96 --> 00:13:35,17
a five member item we had three weeks
annual leave and i usually went to adelaide

140
00:13:35,17 --> 00:13:40,86
because my family were there. Although
i think on one occasion i didn't but

141
00:13:42,31 --> 00:13:48,45
in nineteen hundred twenty eight. I think
it was the beginning or twenty eight the

142
00:13:49,46 --> 00:13:56,01
sydney harbor bridge. I
think both the. My in

143
00:13:56,01 --> 00:14:02,97
space and my steel structure and the
approaches i think both were transferred

144
00:14:02,97 --> 00:14:06,93
to the public works department. Yes as

145
00:14:06,93 --> 00:14:12,10
a matter of fact there was an
insight given to me by. By mr.

146
00:14:12,10 --> 00:14:15,17
Harrell peach about that
and he told me that it was

147
00:14:15,17 --> 00:14:19,49
a deal done between bradfield and knew all
about the who was going to take over the

148
00:14:19,49 --> 00:14:23,56
bridge. Afterwards the railways wanted
it but dr bradfield arranged that the

149
00:14:23,56 --> 00:14:27,71
founder main road should have it. Oh that
was subsequently to the opening of the

150
00:14:27,71 --> 00:14:33,93
bridge. I think well according to mr. Mr
piece this deal was done with mr newell

151
00:14:33,93 --> 00:14:38,44
with the main road sport in those days as
early as 1928 and the railways hearing

152
00:14:38,44 --> 00:14:44,01
about it immediately got rid of all you
people. Oh that's that's news to me but i

153
00:14:44,01 --> 00:14:48,84
wouldn't doubt that it's true because
i've i've seen your record cards in the

154
00:14:48,84 --> 00:14:51,65
railways which are in the
archives there and they have

155
00:14:51,65 --> 00:14:58,19
a very unusual thing on them which says to
be treated as service is dispensed with

156
00:14:58,88 --> 00:15:04,80
the words as if you were fired.
Well i don't know about that. I

157
00:15:07,03 --> 00:15:11,31
always heard was simply i can't remember
details but all we heard simply was that

158
00:15:11,31 --> 00:15:14,83
we had been transferred to the
public works department and as

159
00:15:14,83 --> 00:15:21,48
a result of that we lost the
privileges of free railway travel

160
00:15:22,40 --> 00:15:27,91
and i think the public works department
after some urging i should say i think i

161
00:15:27,91 --> 00:15:34,81
remember rightly agreed to boost
our salaries accordingly.

162
00:15:34,82 --> 00:15:38,25
But it didn't this backfire on you later.
What happened to you after the bridge

163
00:15:39,53 --> 00:15:44,60
when we went to the main roads apartment
of course that was in the middle of the

164
00:15:44,60 --> 00:15:48,43
depression and they were glad to have extra
staff on the bridge just because they

165
00:15:48,43 --> 00:15:51,78
had a lot of bridge work and
they were glad to have it for

166
00:15:52,47 --> 00:15:58,62
a few weeks we remained cleaning
up some of the design work.

167
00:15:59,12 --> 00:16:05,19
On the might have been even three months
on the bridge which wasn't very important

168
00:16:05,19 --> 00:16:12,11
but we kept on it and then. We were transferred
onto bridge design work and i would

169
00:16:12,11 --> 00:16:16,83
been on bridge design work ever since
with the deposed i mean road. Not with

170
00:16:16,83 --> 00:16:22,31
a department of main roads up
until 1965 except for roughly

171
00:16:23,81 --> 00:16:29,19
five years during the war when i was
in the air force. And that makes

172
00:16:29,19 --> 00:16:33,38
a big difference isn't it. We got a bit of

173
00:16:33,38 --> 00:16:38,86
a head of myself. There because i wanted
to ask you again during the bridge. Re the

174
00:16:38,86 --> 00:16:44,37
office your it so you had you. They took
actually took up another office in another

175
00:16:44,37 --> 00:16:50,38
building for next day yesterday and we
stayed in the same office. As far as i can

176
00:16:50,38 --> 00:16:54,16
recall we stayed in the same
office and simply transferred.

177
00:16:57,30 --> 00:17:03,60
Bosses from railways to the public works.
I had met the director of public works

178
00:17:05,12 --> 00:17:09,17
but i can't remember his name now but
which one was their work at the time.

179
00:17:09,19 --> 00:17:14,08
Mitchell there was two at
that time i think it was

180
00:17:14,08 --> 00:17:18,38
a little later that i met him i
forget the circumstances now

181
00:17:21,12 --> 00:17:21,55
i had

182
00:17:21,55 --> 00:17:28,10
a great friend who was an engineer who
went through the university was me and he

183
00:17:28,10 --> 00:17:34,55
established. A business. A
manufacturing business for motor car

184
00:17:34,55 --> 00:17:38,43
parts and later or general
engineering called

185
00:17:41,96 --> 00:17:48,37
. Something service engineers in
melbourne and he came over to

186
00:17:50,35 --> 00:17:56,55
sydney on some business and for some
reason of other he was interviewing the

187
00:17:56,55 --> 00:18:01,23
director of public works and i happened
to be with him at the time and i think i

188
00:18:01,23 --> 00:18:07,10
met the director so it would have
been this would have been some time.

189
00:18:08,43 --> 00:18:14,63
After twenty eight anyway i don't remember
when my friend's name is lentz right

190
00:18:14,63 --> 00:18:19,74
stein but whether he's still alive.
I don't know but he's established

191
00:18:19,74 --> 00:18:25,53
a very big firm in melbourne. This isn't
lee later on we went down to the maritime

192
00:18:25,53 --> 00:18:31,12
services board and i met that then chief
engineer devon and i think it was then.

193
00:18:31,28 --> 00:18:33,53
And they took us on

194
00:18:33,53 --> 00:18:40,49
a launch trip out to fort denison and
showed us around there. That's really

195
00:18:40,49 --> 00:18:40,81
is

196
00:18:40,81 --> 00:18:46,12
a go. I just can't remember the details of
it but lance reichs tied and another friend

197
00:18:46,12 --> 00:18:50,75
of mine who both went through the engineering
course and adelaide at the same time

198
00:18:50,75 --> 00:18:51,27
as you know

199
00:18:51,27 --> 00:18:57,86
a chap named keith duncan who since died
i know he has died. They worked on this.

200
00:19:00,20 --> 00:19:01,08
And it became

201
00:19:01,08 --> 00:19:06,52
a very big industrial service engineer this
is the name of the firm in melbourne in

202
00:19:06,52 --> 00:19:12,65
melbourne. Yes that's right.
Incidently lance strike stein

203
00:19:13,86 --> 00:19:20,53
. Before he started this was prince
became principal of the geelong technical

204
00:19:20,53 --> 00:19:26,49
college. The gordon institute of technology
that's right. That's but this is

205
00:19:26,49 --> 00:19:31,32
nothing to do with the harbour bridge.
Fair enough but let's go back then to. How

206
00:19:31,32 --> 00:19:35,46
come you managed to get up the top of the
bridge so often to take photographs as

207
00:19:35,46 --> 00:19:35,92
a it's

208
00:19:35,92 --> 00:19:43,12
a very fine photograph that you took. We

209
00:19:45,03 --> 00:19:50,52
did set of. Stress
measurements on the bridge

210
00:19:53,25 --> 00:19:59,08
at the suggestion of not sure whether it
was gold and stuckey or someone associated

211
00:20:00,09 --> 00:20:06,16
with work suggested that we ought to
check the stresses and we imported for

212
00:20:07,64 --> 00:20:13,72
strain gauges or when i say we i'm sure
whether it was the railways or the public

213
00:20:13,72 --> 00:20:19,91
works but they imported for which
more strain gauges from america. And

214
00:20:21,07 --> 00:20:27,12
we had to go out and prepare the
members in order that we could

215
00:20:28,85 --> 00:20:35,48
use the strain gauges and check whether
the stress had changed what we had to do

216
00:20:35,48 --> 00:20:42,05
was to go out to the workshop and select
the members. And near the ends of the men

217
00:20:42,05 --> 00:20:48,72
we had to drill two small holes about
sixteenth of an inch in diameter

218
00:20:49,46 --> 00:20:49,51
at

219
00:20:49,52 --> 00:20:56,14
a distance of part of ten inches and the
the points of the strain gauge fitted into

220
00:20:56,14 --> 00:21:02,36
these two holes and the points
were connected by two bars.

221
00:21:02,95 --> 00:21:08,67
And join these two bars being
joined by two flat springs

222
00:21:10,15 --> 00:21:15,77
when the distance between
the two hole to hold very

223
00:21:17,25 --> 00:21:19,53
flat springs moved a pointer on

224
00:21:19,53 --> 00:21:25,35
a dial gauge which read two
hundred thousands of an inch.

225
00:21:26,95 --> 00:21:27,95
Or you could estimate to

226
00:21:27,95 --> 00:21:33,14
a hundred thousands of an inch or
better. What we had to do was to take

227
00:21:33,14 --> 00:21:38,19
a reading on the strain gauge while the
member was lying in the shops which would

228
00:21:38,19 --> 00:21:43,70
be the series ready and when the member
went up into the bridge at various stages

229
00:21:43,70 --> 00:21:50,28
of the erection and in the final
stage we had to take extra readings

230
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,98
and see how that. Distance varied
according to that you could check on

231
00:21:59,27 --> 00:22:04,47
the stress in the member. Now this we
did right from the very start until the

232
00:22:04,47 --> 00:22:11,42
bridge was opened. What we had to do
was therefore to have. If there were

233
00:22:11,42 --> 00:22:17,20
four of us. I'm sorry
what i say there were

234
00:22:18,94 --> 00:22:25,59
four of used to go there were four of the
strain gauges therefore and we needed to

235
00:22:25,59 --> 00:22:31,37
one to work the strain gauge and one into
alternate one to write down the results

236
00:22:31,37 --> 00:22:37,93
and we just alternate so as to check
when other now use their strain gauges

237
00:22:37,93 --> 00:22:44,67
on all the arch members on the western
truss. Because that was this side and

238
00:22:44,67 --> 00:22:51,21
where they were going to have the railway
and then surely because the railway

239
00:22:51,21 --> 00:22:57,42
wasn't going to use them. The. Eastern
truss tracks on the eastern side

240
00:22:58,27 --> 00:23:03,63
at that stage had been decided the railway
wouldn't use them. And one sign they

241
00:23:03,63 --> 00:23:09,80
weren't even going to use tramways not. But
they did ultimately use the tramways on

242
00:23:09,80 --> 00:23:11,85
the eastern side. Dr.

243
00:23:11,85 --> 00:23:12,64
Bradfield had to fight

244
00:23:12,64 --> 00:23:15,73
a battle against that and that's one of the
ones he lost doesn't it. Yes i believe

245
00:23:15,73 --> 00:23:22,09
that is so but then in case you ask why do
we had the opportunity to taking photos

246
00:23:22,09 --> 00:23:26,21
. Well periodically we
went out and had these

247
00:23:29,42 --> 00:23:33,99
bouts of taking strain measurements and
while i was there. I took the opportunity

248
00:23:33,99 --> 00:23:40,39
of taking various photos that explains
quite legal to you if you had

249
00:23:40,39 --> 00:23:44,57
a reason to be out there. That's
right. And i might mention that

250
00:23:48,23 --> 00:23:55,15
used to have to climb over the
edge and up ladders and along and

251
00:23:55,16 --> 00:24:01,56
even down into the inside of the cord
the posts which are hollow members and

252
00:24:02,86 --> 00:24:08,56
not inside the diagonal members but we had
to get inside. I'm not sure what we did

253
00:24:08,56 --> 00:24:12,16
that i mean it was i don't know whether
we got inside those or not some of them

254
00:24:12,16 --> 00:24:19,03
might be why we had to go all over the
arch we used to take readings that

255
00:24:19,03 --> 00:24:25,63
both ends of the member right at the top
of the member and the bottom of them or

256
00:24:26,85 --> 00:24:28,93
one in the other end. This is

257
00:24:28,93 --> 00:24:35,64
a check. There were four
strain gauges therefore we

258
00:24:35,64 --> 00:24:41,14
needed. Eight people to work them and
gordon stuckey used to come along as

259
00:24:41,14 --> 00:24:45,87
a general supervisor but he wouldn't stay
there all the time i must mention that it

260
00:24:45,87 --> 00:24:47,02
was very nice when it was

261
00:24:47,02 --> 00:24:53,82
a nice fine day warm but when it
was cold or raining or. In the

262
00:24:53,82 --> 00:25:00,10
middle of it wasn't very pleasant. And
you get the smell of the paint and the

263
00:25:00,10 --> 00:25:06,87
fire drillings we used to wear boiler
suits or put them over our clothes only

264
00:25:08,91 --> 00:25:14,52
. Franklin field said that it that boiler
suits didn't didn't. Didn't wear long

265
00:25:14,52 --> 00:25:19,06
because the knees used to wear out in the
air in the metal drillings that get stuck

266
00:25:19,06 --> 00:25:24,61
in the paint and such. All that didn't
happen to us when we didn't have much of

267
00:25:24,61 --> 00:25:31,55
that we did have some interesting

268
00:25:31,56 --> 00:25:38,18
experiences on the stress. We

269
00:25:39,32 --> 00:25:46,20
went. I say. Down there quite
often and one occasion

270
00:25:46,20 --> 00:25:47,04
we were in

271
00:25:47,04 --> 00:25:53,90
a thunderstorm basics. The

272
00:25:53,91 --> 00:25:59,92
way it was really frightening thought we
knew darn well that lightning couldn't do

273
00:25:59,93 --> 00:26:02,47
with a harbour bridge arch acts like

274
00:26:02,47 --> 00:26:07,33
a sort of lightning direct
arrest the way. Still it was

275
00:26:07,33 --> 00:26:11,83
a little bit scarier this time because the
lightning seemed to be coming very close

276
00:26:11,83 --> 00:26:17,50
at times as one very big
flash certainly very scary

277
00:26:21,63 --> 00:26:25,97
story about ted pitts an it and repeat
this one. Perhaps he was the son of

278
00:26:25,97 --> 00:26:32,30
a minister i think in hobart.
And we were climbing into

279
00:26:32,30 --> 00:26:34,08
a member one day's it takes

280
00:26:34,08 --> 00:26:40,07
a measure and he knocked his head with

281
00:26:40,07 --> 00:26:41,97
a terrible bang against a bit of

282
00:26:41,97 --> 00:26:48,44
a steel word he says bugger. He's
never been able to live it down.

283
00:26:50,26 --> 00:26:51,12
It was a good he got

284
00:26:51,12 --> 00:27:00,27
a you know that.

285
00:27:00,29 --> 00:27:06,90
Nice chap. Tell me subsequently
in the air force and

286
00:27:06,90 --> 00:27:13,75
something i'm not sure he was afterwards
in the public works department at canberra

287
00:27:14,61 --> 00:27:16,15
the federal public works department had

288
00:27:16,15 --> 00:27:21,48
a very senior position you member first
going up in the on the arch from

289
00:27:21,48 --> 00:27:28,06
a first time he went right up to you. We
alright with the heights. First time i

290
00:27:28,06 --> 00:27:33,93
went on the bridge at all. I went on the
approach spans. I'm not sure how that it

291
00:27:33,93 --> 00:27:39,95
was arranged. But i think we just said
gordon stuckey that we might be allowed to

292
00:27:39,95 --> 00:27:40,15
have

293
00:27:40,15 --> 00:27:44,11
a look over the bridge and i think you gave
us permission to go out one day several

294
00:27:44,11 --> 00:27:45,91
of us and i started to climb up

295
00:27:45,91 --> 00:27:52,89
a ladder onto the top of the truss there
were not very much of the decking

296
00:27:52,89 --> 00:27:58,28
there but there were some of the stringers
there in the stringers about that wide

297
00:27:59,59 --> 00:28:05,41
apart. About six feet five feet six
people apart on the railways and

298
00:28:06,78 --> 00:28:09,15
i remember i had to go

299
00:28:09,15 --> 00:28:14,60
a long way in various places they had
planks. But one or two places where we went

300
00:28:14,60 --> 00:28:20,09
we just had to string it as well as i went
up the ladder to the top and i held it

301
00:28:20,09 --> 00:28:26,96
i'm like grim death. And when i got
up there and saw. Well that was it

302
00:28:26,96 --> 00:28:31,58
wasn't very much room to walk across i had
to walk along this thing i got down and

303
00:28:31,58 --> 00:28:37,42
sat down then slid along. I didn't
like the idea of walking but after

304
00:28:37,42 --> 00:28:42,46
a few such trips i found that.
Oh i think probably read

305
00:28:42,46 --> 00:28:44,97
a bit of psychology. You know if you have

306
00:28:44,97 --> 00:28:49,54
a ten inch plank on the ground. You can
walk along it quite safely but without fear

307
00:28:49,54 --> 00:28:55,29
of falling off. But if it's up hundred fifty
feet in the air you think twice about

308
00:28:55,29 --> 00:28:56,88
it. Well after

309
00:28:56,88 --> 00:29:00,51
a while i sort of thought well there but
if i can do it on the ground. I can do it

310
00:29:00,51 --> 00:29:06,55
up in the air so i got used
to it and never worried be.

311
00:29:07,53 --> 00:29:11,42
Even on the arch it never worried me i could
walk all over the place and climb over

312
00:29:11,42 --> 00:29:16,50
it and and much didn't worry me at all.
Was there rather hard to walk up the arch

313
00:29:16,50 --> 00:29:18,10
on the heads of the rivets. It wasn't is

314
00:29:18,10 --> 00:29:22,02
a dangerous slipping off of the pain wet
paint what have you that wouldn't touch it

315
00:29:22,02 --> 00:29:26,87
with paint and that stage
but there were planks and.

316
00:29:29,03 --> 00:29:35,70
On the lower part where the steeper they
had some sort of them of the walkway.

317
00:29:36,36 --> 00:29:43,14
With posts and rope ropes
alongside after it got

318
00:29:43,14 --> 00:29:48,38
to the flatter part they didn't bother
about any way they just kept some of the

319
00:29:48,38 --> 00:29:53,38
ropes but you've got to bear in mind the
top of the arch. It's eleven feet wide.

320
00:29:53,49 --> 00:29:58,74
All those all the members. The main members
are eleven feet wide. I can't put let

321
00:29:58,74 --> 00:30:05,14
me just but so if you walked along in the
middle that you felt you who were miles

322
00:30:05,14 --> 00:30:11,02
away from the engine you didn't worry that
when we went knocking off work and after

323
00:30:11,03 --> 00:30:16,33
stressing and we were up near the center
there while we were coming down the arch

324
00:30:16,33 --> 00:30:22,90
we used to run down. When we
came to this when we came to the

325
00:30:22,90 --> 00:30:28,40
steps you know we used to run down there.
I used to keep my hand close to the rope

326
00:30:28,40 --> 00:30:31,97
a bit takes a slip but you
don't put your finger on

327
00:30:31,97 --> 00:30:37,94
a class but because the rope would cause
little rope splinters to come in and.

328
00:30:40,05 --> 00:30:43,09
Yes it's interesting. Do you member many
of the workmen on the bridge you have

329
00:30:43,09 --> 00:30:46,11
anything to do with them or is it was there
any impression of what they were doing

330
00:30:46,11 --> 00:30:48,17
. We used to see

331
00:30:48,17 --> 00:30:55,07
a lot of them but i think the
book but i don't think i had

332
00:30:55,07 --> 00:31:01,97
any particular reminiscences
about it all. Jem of the

333
00:31:01,97 --> 00:31:03,70
creeper crane drivers i
see you take a photograph

334
00:31:03,70 --> 00:31:08,40
a photograph of the creeper crane up
there. Well i just remember seeing them. I

335
00:31:08,40 --> 00:31:14,34
used to go up there and he used to look
at me and i and eyes wave and say i was

336
00:31:14,34 --> 00:31:21,31
going up and just go like this. And
they were you don't know their names or

337
00:31:21,31 --> 00:31:25,07
anything. Now i never i do know the names
the ones i was vic wilkins now there was

338
00:31:25,07 --> 00:31:28,16
john king. But you had to be

339
00:31:28,16 --> 00:31:33,30
a bit spry because they were all make certain
when you went up there that you were

340
00:31:33,30 --> 00:31:38,99
they were not going to move the crane. So
your move. The jib not the whole crane

341
00:31:38,99 --> 00:31:42,25
the whole crane was only moved
every time they finished

342
00:31:42,26 --> 00:31:49,14
a panel. But the jet used to move across
sea. And you had to be careful as you

343
00:31:49,14 --> 00:31:55,49
might get skittled never see any of the
accidents that happened. You know those

344
00:31:57,69 --> 00:32:03,97
right. Now what can i ask about
that the the public works

345
00:32:04,76 --> 00:32:09,26
pro choose to do you have anything at all
that we have to do with them not nothing

346
00:32:09,26 --> 00:32:13,58
to do with the approach as you know. I
went over them and inspected them with

347
00:32:13,59 --> 00:32:19,02
a couple of engineers on so several occasions.
But nothing to do with the railways

348
00:32:19,02 --> 00:32:25,16
over. No i think that time. Oh little bit

349
00:32:27,50 --> 00:32:32,83
. I forgot. As you go
over the bridge on the.
