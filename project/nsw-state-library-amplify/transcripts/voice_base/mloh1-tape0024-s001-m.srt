1
00:00:02,97 --> 00:00:05,77
or Into Mister Bill O'Brien,

2
00:00:05,77 --> 00:00:11,22
who worked on the Sydney Harbour Bridge as a carpenter during the building of the bridge German prefers getting a job,

3
00:00:11,22 --> 00:00:17,81
Mister Brian oh yes, I dare the year judge are few and far between at that particular time

4
00:00:17,81 --> 00:00:26,32
and I was very glad to hear a job there and unfortunately a worker on the bridge had fallen from one level to another,

5
00:00:26,32 --> 00:00:31,58
not a great distance, but this had put him out of action and that I was offered the job,

6
00:00:31,58 --> 00:00:34,34
which who is really good for me and bad for him

7
00:00:34,81 --> 00:00:40,2
and I remember going into the office on media sell side of the bridge

8
00:00:40,26 --> 00:00:48,27
and they accepted me having found that I had worked on are rather high buildings have rather high at that stage

9
00:00:48,27 --> 00:00:57,08
and Sydney 's history and learn from their host told to and come in the next day go across the harbour

10
00:00:57,16 --> 00:01:00,41
and don't go to the office underneath the bridge there

11
00:01:00,41 --> 00:01:08,82
and present my credentials so are the next day I cut across on the ferry

12
00:01:08,82 --> 00:01:13,87
and looking up at the bridge at the timber work that I could see up there.

13
00:01:13,87 --> 00:01:23,06
These are timbers were going to support the ball out of concrete that it was over the arch where the trains are at this

14
00:01:23,06 --> 00:01:26,27
stage because it's the motor cars that go through them

15
00:01:26,27 --> 00:01:34,00
and that this was also noted to support they hear a top portion of the year pylon now is told.

16
00:01:34,00 --> 00:01:39,12
I'd be working on the north side on the pylons

17
00:01:39,12 --> 00:01:48,03
and burden across the arch where it was necessary to halfway home looking forward to this because certain I heard there

18
00:01:48,03 --> 00:01:52,4
are paying pretty good money compared to am what other people are getting

19
00:01:52,4 --> 00:01:56,34
and there were all these people out of work and I had had a lot of that.

20
00:01:56,34 --> 00:02:04,31
How to work myself having suspended five-year bound apprenticeship and don't let apprenticeship to come out

21
00:02:04,31 --> 00:02:10,72
and make a fortune in the world and find that to everything was disappearing in a way of jobs

22
00:02:10,78 --> 00:02:18,89
and that having months in between gardens is very disappointing time and Seo

23
00:02:18,89 --> 00:02:27,82
and Irish really delighted to be starting on this bridge I had it played many times to get a job on them that that was

24
00:02:27,82 --> 00:02:37,98
almost impossible that many people who have had the same idea that I'd had and then here I was with John

25
00:02:37,98 --> 00:02:43,66
and on my way across the harbour on the ferry and looking up at the structure

26
00:02:43,66 --> 00:02:51,92
and the two miracle is from down the ferry that I could see up there that I would be working on those seem to be about

27
00:02:51,96 --> 00:02:58,78
six by six inches square and about twenty feet may be fifteen feet high.

28
00:02:58,78 --> 00:03:06,62
when I actually got up and down I found it was fifteen by fifteen inches and some other eighteen by eighteen inches

29
00:03:06,62 --> 00:03:10,63
and twenty five to thirty feet nine as is quite a surprise,

30
00:03:10,63 --> 00:03:18,46
as wondering how are going to move it around was then I found that the all the cutting was done on the road level

31
00:03:18,56 --> 00:03:26,27
and that these were taken up by crane into their position had meant you only cut them once because Sir,

32
00:03:26,27 --> 00:03:34,00
when the crane do the job of lifting up they had to be right and it meant that don't quite a bit of firm

33
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:39,82
and sort had to go into the job that you are doing now.

34
00:03:39,82 --> 00:03:49,47
I started up their are on this construction of the supports that would hold the concrete of the arch on the pylons.

35
00:03:49,47 --> 00:03:59,69
This is the archers there are called them out of all this and that there was semicircular barrel type falls.

36
00:03:59,69 --> 00:04:05,71
This created the ceiling of those that portion through traffic now passes through due

37
00:04:05,71 --> 00:04:08,22
and what sort of timber you use the type.

38
00:04:08,22 --> 00:04:12,62
Yes, the timber was all our ego, which shows a wholesaler rather pleased with.

39
00:04:12,62 --> 00:04:19,52
Because so it meant that do your tools would do and not be getting a very bad time.

40
00:04:19,52 --> 00:04:24,86
Other members been a hard worker something of that sort out the tools which are all carpenters

41
00:04:24,86 --> 00:04:28,89
and their own tools so they always interested in what you happen to the my job

42
00:04:29,19 --> 00:04:34,89
and I will miss this is served pretty expensive thing when that when you are out of work.

43
00:04:34,89 --> 00:04:40,97
I have been out of work and got a replay something are now after it

44
00:04:41,03 --> 00:04:44,77
and all what I was on that particular section there.

45
00:04:44,77 --> 00:04:51,17
I found I have to do something is a bit unusual to me are the timber to bore a hole through it

46
00:04:51,23 --> 00:04:56,35
and some pieces were eighteen by eighteen sitting on another piece eighteen by eighteen,

47
00:04:56,35 --> 00:05:04,77
which gave your three feet through and as you had boreholes through this the bolts they had big air driven drills

48
00:05:04,77 --> 00:05:12,23
and these girls had a mighty big hose connected to them how you had to stand up there with your legs apart

49
00:05:12,23 --> 00:05:19,06
and whole that drill in a hole that you had made in the timber with a thing called a white punch

50
00:05:19,06 --> 00:05:27,77
and the sermon just simply chop to a piece of the timber out in round section seven of the end of the drill which did

51
00:05:27,77 --> 00:05:31,72
not have a leading bet on it and it would sit in the whole,

52
00:05:31,72 --> 00:05:41,3
then you had a hole that drill that is served three feet long drill at protruding out of BDO machine has so that was

53
00:05:41,3 --> 00:05:46,04
perfectly levels straight it agree if you're on top of it.

54
00:05:46,04 --> 00:05:52,62
The legs apart, you had a whole it so that that it was going to go through three feet of timber

55
00:05:52,62 --> 00:05:57,3
and come out somewhere near the middle on the other side. Hopefully right in the middle.

56
00:05:57,3 --> 00:06:02,73
I found this was quite quite a job to do because served your aware

57
00:06:02,73 --> 00:06:07,32
or would stink if you didn't lifted out under clear it

58
00:06:07,32 --> 00:06:15,01
and put it back in now if the debt stack that meant the drill went around and as Europe many high up in the air.

59
00:06:15,01 --> 00:06:19,39
There is nowhere for you to GABA down so you're pretty careful about business

60
00:06:19,39 --> 00:06:23,73
and as you herded labouring parents switch off the air and followed out

61
00:06:23,73 --> 00:06:29,56
and make sure it was clear again because I did have an experience where the drill:

62
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:34,24
in a bit caught in the drill started again around because I let it go,

63
00:06:34,24 --> 00:06:38,39
but there are other soon chastised about that way of doing things

64
00:06:38,39 --> 00:06:47,5
and that ever after that I was very careful about that building a procedure is as Nobel don't let go story

65
00:06:47,5 --> 00:06:49,31
and yet as a drive

66
00:06:49,31 --> 00:06:59,52
and then they said them they were building a platform to go underneath the bridge on rails to be used for the painters

67
00:06:59,52 --> 00:07:06,48
to when the term do the bridge from the under position and this would travel from one side of the bridge,

68
00:07:06,48 --> 00:07:08,98
the other a rear permanent structure.

69
00:07:08,98 --> 00:07:10,00
The painting gantry

70
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:18,96
and he has arisen painting gantry paths was made down the workshops on the shore where Luna Park was eventually

71
00:07:18,96 --> 00:07:28,28
and they are sent down there to put the decking on the metalwork of this servant painting and well platform

72
00:07:28,28 --> 00:07:35,55
or want whatever you wish to call it and them. This server. This was a great experience.

73
00:07:35,55 --> 00:07:43,06
After several months out of work to suddenly come into replace the resolve hell let lives with drilling machines

74
00:07:43,06 --> 00:07:49,87
multiple drilling machines are punching machines punching pieces out of the steel plate

75
00:07:49,87 --> 00:07:57,51
and mighty big blast furnaces which were picked up by cranes which are up on the roof of the workshops

76
00:07:57,51 --> 00:07:59,95
and that just taken from one end of the job.

77
00:07:59,95 --> 00:08:01,1
The other rather than try

78
00:08:01,1 --> 00:08:08,96
and turn the job around because it the hello roar of these things say it was an absolute nightmare

79
00:08:08,96 --> 00:08:16,87
and having had a very quiet time of being out of work without any noise as this was certain something that third took a

80
00:08:16,87 --> 00:08:22,32
lot of that taking IAM found that when I went overnight. I just couldn't sleep.

81
00:08:22,32 --> 00:08:25,96
I'd hear all these things going on and that I'd wake up

82
00:08:25,96 --> 00:08:29,7
and think I've got to get on with our guardian going him at a sleeping

83
00:08:29,88 --> 00:08:36,67
and this went on to a couple of nights before I got that bit settle down to the conditions in those workshops,

84
00:08:36,67 --> 00:08:42,2
but to sell those things happening there was an amazing engineering workshop.

85
00:08:42,2 --> 00:08:50,82
I'd never seen multiple drills working boring about six seven holes of the one time in one big piece of black plate so

86
00:08:50,82 --> 00:08:53,43
preserve every day was an amazing day for me

87
00:08:53,43 --> 00:09:02,67
and I appreciated the workmen that we are using all this equipment are eventually we finish this certain platform

88
00:09:02,67 --> 00:09:05,81
and to whom it was served to be taken out later

89
00:09:05,81 --> 00:09:11,67
and attached underneath the bridge then I returned back up onto the top of the brands

90
00:09:11,67 --> 00:09:21,12
and I found that at that stage of your salary with Sam dependent on the heights above ground level that you worked on

91
00:09:21,12 --> 00:09:31,54
and that each day if you alter during working position you would get a different rate of pay now eventually because of

92
00:09:31,54 --> 00:09:33,24
the office there was a was on about that.

93
00:09:33,24 --> 00:09:37,61
She seems you had to calculate different rates of over people move around systems.

94
00:09:37,61 --> 00:09:43,84
It is better yet that that's certain something I'm afraid that have a terrible time with that

95
00:09:43,84 --> 00:09:49,65
and it meant that if you went up top firm for an hour and you had to go down to

96
00:09:49,65 --> 00:09:56,03
and do something you step into your job and they had to alter this pay rate again.

97
00:09:56,03 --> 00:10:00,02
So after a while I think that if out of the difficult they made at a flat rate,

98
00:10:00,02 --> 00:10:06,13
but I know we were getting seven pounds fifteen, which hi, it is amazing at that time,

99
00:10:06,13 --> 00:10:12,18
whereas soon the carpenters working down on the RAID level of the Department Iraq Main roads.

100
00:10:12,18 --> 00:10:17,13
They were just getting over three pounds and three pounds fifteen elegant wires

101
00:10:17,13 --> 00:10:23,56
and then where we really felt that that we come into a goldmine and working up there.

102
00:10:23,56 --> 00:10:29,66
We didn't mind how high we went what it is, did you see anything unusual from working up.

103
00:10:29,66 --> 00:10:35,45
I well we has to notice served the Blue Mountains every morning

104
00:10:35,45 --> 00:10:43,21
and then on some Angolans with dampness coming down over portions of the rocks on the Blue Mountains you've said

105
00:10:43,21 --> 00:10:50,15
listening as though it was a mirror Justin spots where there is a lot of the soakage apparently

106
00:10:50,15 --> 00:10:55,14
and also the temperature down in the M ground level area.

107
00:10:55,14 --> 00:11:02,46
It would perhaps be just normal and ordinary Day in Sydney but by the time we got up the top.

108
00:11:02,46 --> 00:11:09,84
It could have a terrific wind up there be a very cow and a concern that nothing to protect your much they are,

109
00:11:09,84 --> 00:11:17,83
you had to adjust the work out your own means of far staying there because is very little in the way of protection,

110
00:11:17,83 --> 00:11:26,62
no safety belts or things that years today on projects that sort to do have a lucky escape still no

111
00:11:26,62 --> 00:11:34,19
but I had some experiences where I ran. I had to claim down a set of stairs that day.

112
00:11:34,19 --> 00:11:40,38
We just put into a platform where people had to work and cut off a piece of timber

113
00:11:40,57 --> 00:11:48,23
and I had nowhere to put that piece of timber so having cut the piece of timber are found, but the saw under one arm

114
00:11:48,39 --> 00:11:55,47
and a piece of timber with that but I just cut I'll climb back up using the other arm to hold on

115
00:11:55,6 --> 00:11:58,34
and place it somewhere safe and then go down

116
00:11:58,34 --> 00:12:06,53
and continue on with the job I was doing though one of the jobs that I found in a very exciting one was to

117
00:12:06,53 --> 00:12:14,97
and put in a steer down a staircase down to a platform where fellows were going to work for a period of time

118
00:12:15,09 --> 00:12:24,03
and the usually the rigours would do put in the platform and the carpenters would do have put the stairway down there.

119
00:12:24,03 --> 00:12:29,6
This usually meant there are going to work on the platform but a long while if if they were not get any work.

120
00:12:29,6 --> 00:12:37,18
Therefore any great time because they don't slimmer down the sides or walk up the rivets and that's how it was done.

121
00:12:37,18 --> 00:12:41,7
We also put a lot of staircases right across product halfway.

122
00:12:41,7 --> 00:12:48,42
We are working on the arch and inward the treads of the staircases were done in Word,

123
00:12:48,42 --> 00:12:55,3
because certain they would don't have to be taken up again further different procedures of going on the bridge

124
00:12:55,3 --> 00:13:00,85
eventually of course they would all be steel plate steps that that that stage we had to go up

125
00:13:00,85 --> 00:13:09,36
and put the wooden ones in and that was so exciting, and because everything that day was that you can't more discarded.

126
00:13:09,36 --> 00:13:15,5
You had to make some provisions for getting it away to a safe position, you couldn't just flowed over because,

127
00:13:15,5 --> 00:13:22,38
as people working down below and also the other fairies and other boats going through on the harbour.

128
00:13:22,38 --> 00:13:26,56
So when I say that turn hanging on was the main thing.

129
00:13:26,56 --> 00:13:32,92
Another thing, of course, Liam to stop the rust problem all the steel had been known

130
00:13:32,92 --> 00:13:37,39
and coated with some material to run.

131
00:13:37,39 --> 00:13:45,67
The rust problem now this meant that it was Sir slip bread and then there were times when you get on your boots

132
00:13:45,67 --> 00:13:47,78
and there on your tools

133
00:13:47,78 --> 00:13:55,14
and things you be trying to drive a nail new find that you had paid on the end of a hammer wet paint pan

134
00:13:55,14 --> 00:14:01,69
and you don't lose your your aim was aim of the right begin slip off that nail pretty easily

135
00:14:01,69 --> 00:14:04,9
and this work the balance than

136
00:14:04,9 --> 00:14:14,95
when I say that the many exciting things that there nature that happened while you are there to remember any accidents

137
00:14:14,95 --> 00:14:23,59
that happen to other people know fortunately I was soon not in place to anybody who ran had an accident in the period

138
00:14:23,59 --> 00:14:28,73
that I was working on the bridge management of the working conditions generally.

139
00:14:28,73 --> 00:14:38,98
ISBN working conditions, of course, receive our own flower you didn't get holidays you didn't get sick leave

140
00:14:38,98 --> 00:14:47,73
and their I just come out of a five-year bound apprenticeship with another company and then to go up there

141
00:14:47,73 --> 00:14:56,69
and get all the that money which is a terrific amount that the time I was that the happy to do so. That term.

142
00:14:56,69 --> 00:15:02,37
I didn't worry much about holidays, sick leave. This sat only came in later years.

143
00:15:02,37 --> 00:15:06,17
Whether improvements for people generally in the trade.

144
00:15:06,17 --> 00:15:13,13
We remember the union that I was I was a member of the union from my apprenticeship days right as an apprentice right

145
00:15:13,13 --> 00:15:20,29
through which union was that that was the building workers industrial union being a guest firm DMM

146
00:15:20,29 --> 00:15:27,09
and union activity during the building of the bridge, PS2 around meetings if Tuam

147
00:15:27,09 --> 00:15:33,55
and discuss matters that were worrying members who are working on the bit bridge to try

148
00:15:33,55 --> 00:15:36,79
and improve their ran working conditions

149
00:15:36,79 --> 00:15:45,91
and am their wages home also the amenities that turn a really ever say non-existent.

150
00:15:45,91 --> 00:15:54,41
We are to act are come to work going to a big shed that was right down to ground level and in there you just changed

151
00:15:54,41 --> 00:16:00,59
and they got your bag of tools and gross as I said before all the tools belong to the

152
00:16:00,59 --> 00:16:06,98
and each tradesmen they resent up on it, so you had to make sure that they were locked up of the night

153
00:16:06,98 --> 00:16:15,86
and safe so that you have them to the next day 's work now from that shared they had ladders running up to the RAID

154
00:16:15,86 --> 00:16:19,12
level that from ground level to RAID level

155
00:16:19,12 --> 00:16:29,34
and they were just very very wide ladders they'd be perhaps six feet wired with firm to piece of timber on the outside

156
00:16:29,34 --> 00:16:36,12
in one piece right about the middle of it and there are many of these which side-by-side so

157
