1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,83
Is he telling us about. Oh yes well
we went to america and our last tour

2
00:00:07,62 --> 00:00:10,62
and finished up in the game
and hawaii. You'd have

3
00:00:10,62 --> 00:00:16,17
a game you know no i didn't know no longer
to see and if you believe in the golden

4
00:00:16,17 --> 00:00:19,76
oldies are well i play the golden
oldies oh it's quarter short to try

5
00:00:19,76 --> 00:00:20,93
a course was set up

6
00:00:20,93 --> 00:00:26,85
a bit i'll admit we played the
gentleman all new york and we had

7
00:00:26,85 --> 00:00:30,75
a great day of funny things that happened
to you know each is recorded. I believe

8
00:00:30,75 --> 00:00:33,79
around about the place i'd love to see
in some of the other games when you hear

9
00:00:33,79 --> 00:00:38,00
about them but that night i remember that
night we brought the jem one of york over

10
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:44,32
to our club. And the referee and
we had that on tape and was shown

11
00:00:45,45 --> 00:00:49,79
up in our club at north northern suburbs
rugby club here anyway. One of their

12
00:00:49,79 --> 00:00:50,39
players was

13
00:00:50,39 --> 00:00:55,96
a big tall negro. He must have been about
six foot four or five big tall fell and i

14
00:00:55,96 --> 00:00:57,45
said you know just for

15
00:00:57,45 --> 00:01:03,83
a joke joke and i said how can you get
fifteen gentleman in new york to play rugby

16
00:01:03,83 --> 00:01:06,14
or fifteen general and
then your going to a is

17
00:01:06,14 --> 00:01:11,03
a guy's boy you're the third man
that's asking that question. They are

18
00:01:11,03 --> 00:01:15,25
a great crowd. Now but they heard after
that there was another take all the old

19
00:01:15,25 --> 00:01:21,03
gentlemen of new york. So the two teams
from new york airplane rugby and that tour

20
00:01:21,03 --> 00:01:21,90
. You know but it was

21
00:01:21,90 --> 00:01:28,05
a great great afternoon late afternoon.
You've got any more football story. Rugby

22
00:01:28,05 --> 00:01:30,48
stories or i suppose i'd have

23
00:01:30,48 --> 00:01:35,51
a few you know but i'd have to
throw my mind packed in as well

24
00:01:35,51 --> 00:01:41,03
a little england baby not west worth
recording little sayings. But i can tell you

25
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:42,53
one great story about

26
00:01:42,53 --> 00:01:46,65
a well known character who everyone our
australian knows and it's about nugget made

27
00:01:46,65 --> 00:01:49,41
norm a fact i'm looking at him on t.v.

28
00:01:49,41 --> 00:01:54,05
Last night. I know and i got very very well
indeed and we were planned against one

29
00:01:54,05 --> 00:01:59,73
another in the third grade game down at
manly oval. So i said to my halfback i said

30
00:01:59,73 --> 00:02:02,27
look if i think his name. I can't think of

31
00:02:02,27 --> 00:02:07,66
a time i said always put it in on the
left hand side whether it's tight head or

32
00:02:07,66 --> 00:02:10,77
loose head. So it's

33
00:02:10,77 --> 00:02:14,13
a that's rather strange always put the ball
in on the lucid side where you got the

34
00:02:14,13 --> 00:02:18,27
benefit of the extra head to hook the
ball back i was planned hooker. I said i

35
00:02:18,27 --> 00:02:23,47
don't like everyone. So i think that's
rather strange you always wanted the ball

36
00:02:23,47 --> 00:02:27,68
put him on the left hand side. I said yes
there is and they got the sight of one

37
00:02:27,68 --> 00:02:28,84
eye. Well

38
00:02:28,84 --> 00:02:32,88
a lot heard what they call me. And they
said and it turned out i mean i got my

39
00:02:33,71 --> 00:02:38,79
because they don't got a sight. When
i you know and i think i got once in

40
00:02:38,79 --> 00:02:41,05
a while then we laugh. You know. So that's

41
00:02:41,05 --> 00:02:47,31
a strike until about no i got my mind.
That's playing for the conditions all right

42
00:02:47,31 --> 00:02:51,15
. Isn't it. Yes or well you play to the
weakness or the other person don't you know

43
00:02:51,15 --> 00:02:55,45
no matter what. What job. I
think. Same and cricket.

44
00:02:58,13 --> 00:03:02,81
Did you play cricket know never play
cricket ever say the oh they only i i've

45
00:03:02,81 --> 00:03:06,63
played about two games at life and they
were fun games. The other game i played was

46
00:03:06,63 --> 00:03:10,56
a bank and games. Well i was down at
mount avail surf club those days and we

47
00:03:10,56 --> 00:03:17,15
invited some of our boys to connect to our
club or work for their rural bank those

48
00:03:17,15 --> 00:03:18,02
days and they knew

49
00:03:18,02 --> 00:03:23,07
a lot of rain we boys so we invited the
randwick boys down to our. We had an old

50
00:03:23,07 --> 00:03:23,96
place down there called

51
00:03:23,96 --> 00:03:28,97
a shack which we eventually bought from
my football club i'd be tossed in and got

52
00:03:28,97 --> 00:03:33,60
it cheap in the early days just after the
war so invite all this rhetoric football

53
00:03:33,60 --> 00:03:40,49
club to play cricket and there were the
famous serial towers since passed away

54
00:03:40,49 --> 00:03:45,96
the great australian rugby player and several
others. I went into bat and i said i

55
00:03:45,96 --> 00:03:50,78
will i'm sure turned about and i'm pulling
on some swim flippers. They said what do

56
00:03:50,78 --> 00:03:55,53
you put the swim flippers on for my said
well they tell me they're there they make

57
00:03:55,53 --> 00:04:02,40
it quicker they serve only in the bloody
water. So i found that out by playing

58
00:04:02,40 --> 00:04:05,99
cricket because i dozed and i got half i
think i hit the ball and start to run and

59
00:04:05,99 --> 00:04:11,34
i fell fell over. So i i proved to the
boys that they they swim rivers don't make

60
00:04:11,34 --> 00:04:17,62
your faster. So that's because my last
game of cricket i played. Oh fun days

61
00:04:18,87 --> 00:04:25,37
. Yes you have the years
that you play work at gilboa

62
00:04:25,37 --> 00:04:29,58
you've got to be what do you do
there. Oh i was started off as

63
00:04:29,58 --> 00:04:36,45
a storm and packer storm and one thing
and another then got a little bit of

64
00:04:36,45 --> 00:04:41,34
a lift when i'm on and i suppose i found
out i was very keen but you had to be keen

65
00:04:41,34 --> 00:04:46,71
as a skipper job anyway where
you eventually you know got

66
00:04:46,71 --> 00:04:50,64
a bit elevated i suppose in the job and to

67
00:04:50,64 --> 00:04:57,57
a. It's better job in the stores. Anyway
eventually when the electric pumps

68
00:04:57,57 --> 00:05:04,55
came on. They said look where we
want to send you to melbourne high

69
00:05:04,55 --> 00:05:05,68
for what sin is

70
00:05:05,68 --> 00:05:10,14
a melbourne to look after things down there
there and we have put in an electric

71
00:05:10,14 --> 00:05:15,69
pumps in melbourne. Now after they came to
sydney and i g. So anyway. They sent me

72
00:05:15,69 --> 00:05:20,62
to melbourne i had to look after the dispatch
of the pumps and make sure everything

73
00:05:20,62 --> 00:05:25,95
went right i got ready and you know
got all the boys down there. So

74
00:05:28,03 --> 00:05:31,24
just organize the distribution of the
pumps and make sure they took the right

75
00:05:31,24 --> 00:05:36,89
materials down for the changeover period
from the old manual pumps which used to

76
00:05:37,78 --> 00:05:38,43
pump up into

77
00:05:38,43 --> 00:05:45,28
a bowl at the top and let down in the car.
And so that was quite interesting and

78
00:05:46,74 --> 00:05:51,44
so well as down there was end of the season
my own rugby season finished so i went

79
00:05:51,44 --> 00:05:55,60
and joined up the melbourne rugby club
had two or three games of them which i

80
00:05:55,60 --> 00:06:00,85
enjoyed but that was that when that finished
i came back to sydney then they sent

81
00:06:00,85 --> 00:06:07,72
me to to adelaide. I thought of it.
This is good to get in see in australia

82
00:06:07,72 --> 00:06:13,66
someone else's expense. I went over to
adelaide done the same job down eventually i

83
00:06:13,67 --> 00:06:19,94
was sent to and then new castle and then
eventually up to brisbane so i got around

84
00:06:19,94 --> 00:06:26,29
so you know i got. Fairly good job there.
Then i became we and charge of the stores

85
00:06:26,29 --> 00:06:30,89
here in sydney and the transport because
then i retired from then they moved up

86
00:06:30,89 --> 00:06:32,38
a long way out us in

87
00:06:32,38 --> 00:06:36,70
a well going from home. They moved up to
what's right. I didn't feel like going of

88
00:06:36,70 --> 00:06:42,06
had my mother then this not too well at
the time i suppose get on and yes i paid

89
00:06:42,06 --> 00:06:45,91
off my house and paid off my car i
thought i. Damn it all. I'll get

90
00:06:45,91 --> 00:06:50,87
a small pension from the
your back. And mum was on

91
00:06:50,87 --> 00:06:56,39
a army pension the whole man to join
the army as early days never went away

92
00:06:58,05 --> 00:07:03,09
as he told and he was a t b l and i
said well what's there. It was a t

93
00:07:03,09 --> 00:07:09,93
b early too bloody late. Locally
and anyway so we decided i'd

94
00:07:09,93 --> 00:07:15,11
give up and that's when i got the job.
Later on with an z bank but. I've got

95
00:07:15,11 --> 00:07:21,49
a life. I'm still there to tell the story
anyway. No regrets no regrets. No no

96
00:07:21,49 --> 00:07:27,91
regrets no regrets. Oh well i suppose for
the same life i would tell i had to live

97
00:07:27,91 --> 00:07:33,97
a game of do that as one of our stroman and
poet said if i had life over that i had

98
00:07:33,97 --> 00:07:39,17
to live game. I do the same things over.
If i had to live again as was his word. So

99
00:07:39,17 --> 00:07:43,16
adam is a good and i think
said that. And i share

100
00:07:43,16 --> 00:07:48,01
a past time and i've done my share of toil
and life is short. The longest life span

101
00:07:48,01 --> 00:07:48,87
. I care not about

102
00:07:48,87 --> 00:07:55,56
a tariff or the corner for the oil
or the you know i think something's

103
00:07:57,61 --> 00:08:03,31
trying to think of the four words i.
Something or other did you ever go in for

104
00:08:03,31 --> 00:08:09,87
a stepford reciting no no no i. Now like i

105
00:08:09,87 --> 00:08:11,79
suppose i am quit on earth as

106
00:08:11,79 --> 00:08:16,59
a bucks do i could tell some great stories
and some of them or australians and some

107
00:08:16,59 --> 00:08:23,58
of my rugby stories. Got it or you could
say no no i have very in mind this

108
00:08:23,58 --> 00:08:25,16
is modern times in the u.s.

109
00:08:25,16 --> 00:08:25,62
You know

110
00:08:25,62 --> 00:08:32,03
a lot of things you know. Well i suppose i
can always tell one story about this is

111
00:08:32,03 --> 00:08:37,31
told to me by. At i do you
know we had around club

112
00:08:37,31 --> 00:08:43,85
a rugby dinner by the late. Chief
justice. Les herron lesley herring.

113
00:08:43,87 --> 00:08:46,16
Unless it's on this story because he was

114
00:08:46,16 --> 00:08:49,21
a great after dinner speaking
always tell the story which he had

115
00:08:49,21 --> 00:08:51,69
a lot of stories to tell. I could tell

116
00:08:51,69 --> 00:08:55,22
a couple if you want to hear them. But this
is one always stuck in my mind which he

117
00:08:55,22 --> 00:09:00,78
told and that was this fella watching this
international going on and one fellow

118
00:09:00,78 --> 00:09:07,57
was very hard of hearin. And it was this
chap it was playing with kicking goals

119
00:09:07,57 --> 00:09:12,55
hear them from area drop kicking field
goals and penalty goals from the sideline

120
00:09:12,55 --> 00:09:18,80
using wizard kicking. So one fill in the
past not the message and. What are you

121
00:09:18,80 --> 00:09:25,15
doing it said he's an italian. I
said like that. So he said what is

122
00:09:25,15 --> 00:09:31,30
a he said he's an italian. I was told
i know one of the bugger can kick

123
00:09:35,46 --> 00:09:40,23
the story you know what i can
always tell about the this is

124
00:09:40,23 --> 00:09:44,45
a sports story about the golfer and he was

125
00:09:44,45 --> 00:09:51,10
a live golf everywhere golf golf golf.
So is going overseas to play in

126
00:09:51,10 --> 00:09:56,03
a tiny over there or over in the pacific
island somewhere to play in the twenty

127
00:09:56,03 --> 00:09:56,71
there and

128
00:09:56,71 --> 00:10:02,80
a plane crash and he was the only survivor
managed to get up to this lovely little

129
00:10:02,80 --> 00:10:08,61
island exhort he throws himself down and
he passes out. When he comes to there's

130
00:10:08,61 --> 00:10:13,10
a beautiful made lovely. Lovely made

131
00:10:13,10 --> 00:10:18,32
a local girl and she's rubbing them down
with coconut oil and stoking them and

132
00:10:18,32 --> 00:10:24,47
bring them round and he looks
up to her and he said wearable

133
00:10:25,46 --> 00:10:31,50
this is just as on the high island
of so-and-so and so she fell he was

134
00:10:31,50 --> 00:10:35,65
a good looking young both she said would
you like to play around. He said don't

135
00:10:35,65 --> 00:10:37,78
tell me there's a bloody golf
course on this island to.
