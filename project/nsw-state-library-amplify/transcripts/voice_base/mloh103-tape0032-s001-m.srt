1
00:00:16,68 --> 00:00:23,70
Good.

2
00:00:24,99 --> 00:00:31,13
Ok. M c c a b.

3
00:00:33,70 --> 00:00:36,92
My name's pauline mccabe
and i'm a natural pairs.

4
00:00:37,14 --> 00:00:42,51
I work in nimbin in a small business
called the nimbin apothecary.

5
00:00:42,52 --> 00:00:49,51
And i've been living in this
area for about five years now.

6
00:00:51,85 --> 00:00:53,78
I first came up here about six

7
00:00:53,78 --> 00:00:58,66
or seven years ago to visit friends who
had bought into a multiple occupancy up

8
00:00:58,66 --> 00:01:04,30
here. And. I really love the area and.

9
00:01:05,67 --> 00:01:09,46
Realised at the time
that i could buy a house

10
00:01:09,46 --> 00:01:13,71
or land up here for much less money
than it would cost me in melbourne.

11
00:01:13,72 --> 00:01:15,50
Which was definitely an attraction

12
00:01:15,50 --> 00:01:21,35
but i suppose chiefly it was really the
natural beauty of this area that drew me

13
00:01:21,35 --> 00:01:22,33
and still does.

14
00:01:22,92 --> 00:01:32,44
Apart from the alternative culture.

15
00:01:33,58 --> 00:01:37,58
With alternative medicine in nimbin
probably started at the aquarius festival i

16
00:01:37,58 --> 00:01:42,08
think there were i wasn't there but
there were healing stalls and massaged

17
00:01:42,08 --> 00:01:44,67
and all of that sort of thing
occurring at the time.

18
00:01:46,37 --> 00:01:51,55
In 1973 and then amongst the
people who settled here following

19
00:01:51,55 --> 00:01:57,28
that there were quite a number
of natural therapists and.

20
00:01:59,45 --> 00:02:04,10
I suppose. One of the central
activities around which this.

21
00:02:04,11 --> 00:02:10,03
Which became a sort of core. And magnet
for natural healing was birth and beyond.

22
00:02:10,19 --> 00:02:12,03
You know about birth and beyond.

23
00:02:15,34 --> 00:02:17,68
So birth and beyond
catering for pregnant women

24
00:02:17,68 --> 00:02:23,12
and births at home were also very
much involved in natural therapies

25
00:02:23,84 --> 00:02:29,54
and they actually taught themselves some
of them the midwives things like herbal

26
00:02:29,54 --> 00:02:35,56
medicine and homoeopathy there were
a couple of trained acupuncturists

27
00:02:35,56 --> 00:02:41,50
and they kind of set up a healing centre
in nimbin which revolved around the earth

28
00:02:41,50 --> 00:02:45,10
and beyond and i think that
was the beginning of it.

29
00:02:46,86 --> 00:02:51,09
And i don't know whether there was it at
the time 20 years ago a chiropractor in

30
00:02:51,09 --> 00:02:53,26
lismore there might have
been but apart from that.

31
00:02:54,61 --> 00:03:00,24
My understanding is that there was
no other sort of natural medicine.

32
00:03:02,15 --> 00:03:04,63
And since that time i mean birth
and beyond. It's still going.

33
00:03:04,91 --> 00:03:08,91
It's been a very successful case of
community development in health care

34
00:03:12,46 --> 00:03:17,67
run by equally by train midwives
lay midwives and mothers.

35
00:03:17,69 --> 00:03:19,59
And 14 years down the track.

36
00:03:19,61 --> 00:03:20,83
It's still quite a viable

37
00:03:23,05 --> 00:03:29,61
and vibrant organisation.

38
00:03:31,40 --> 00:03:33,38
So simply with all the new settlers

39
00:03:33,38 --> 00:03:37,55
that came to the area were a significant
number of natural therapists of all kinds

40
00:03:37,55 --> 00:03:40,37
and it's become the whole area has become.

41
00:03:41,78 --> 00:03:46,58
Very well known for all kinds of natural
medicine and that has spread from nimbin.

42
00:03:47,25 --> 00:03:51,32
To lismore and all the
other surrounding towns.

43
00:03:51,34 --> 00:03:59,76
Ripped through.

44
00:04:04,51 --> 00:04:08,47
Well all the major mode elitism
represented which are chiropractic

45
00:04:08,47 --> 00:04:11,95
and osteopathy homoeopathy.

46
00:04:11,97 --> 00:04:14,49
Herbal medicine natural pathy

47
00:04:14,49 --> 00:04:20,01
and traditional chinese medicine
which basically includes acupuncture

48
00:04:20,01 --> 00:04:26,42
and chinese herbal medicine and apart
from that there are many other.

49
00:04:26,44 --> 00:04:29,20
Lesser known sorts of theory p such as.

50
00:04:30,78 --> 00:04:37,00
Polarity therapy reflexology all kinds of
alternative psychological therapies such

51
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:41,88
as. How. Rebirthing.

52
00:04:43,25 --> 00:04:49,43
Gushed out child therapies.
In l.p. Just to name a few.

53
00:04:50,03 --> 00:05:03,45
There are many many of them.

54
00:05:04,62 --> 00:05:10,50
Well i think that. Healing is
an instinct that everybody has.

55
00:05:10,87 --> 00:05:15,18
It's a very creative activity

56
00:05:16,51 --> 00:05:17,57
and i think

57
00:05:17,57 --> 00:05:24,22
that there's generally throughout society
a growing move to take responsibility

58
00:05:24,22 --> 00:05:26,85
for one's own health and
a lot of the people

59
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:32,54
that get involved in healing start off by
healing their own illnesses be they minor

60
00:05:32,54 --> 00:05:38,31
or major and through that they develop
an interest in natural medicine so

61
00:05:38,31 --> 00:05:40,04
that.

62
00:05:40,06 --> 00:05:45,22
Less and less these people go to doctors
and take drugs and resort to surgery

63
00:05:45,22 --> 00:05:51,18
and they try all sorts of other
means and then they maybe go

64
00:05:51,18 --> 00:05:52,66
and get some some training

65
00:05:52,66 --> 00:05:56,28
and become qualified natural therapists
in some field that interests them.

66
00:05:56,72 --> 00:06:03,39
Or maybe they don't. Maybe they
just. Can. Do you to practice.

67
00:06:03,41 --> 00:06:09,66
As unqualified to parts in areas as a lesser
mode ality such as you know massaging

68
00:06:09,66 --> 00:06:14,95
crystal syrup in things like that.
But basically i see it as a sort of.

69
00:06:15,36 --> 00:06:22,33
Part of a wider social movement towards
taking responsibility for one's own health.

70
00:06:22,43 --> 00:06:24,92
Taking it out of the hands of other people

71
00:06:24,92 --> 00:06:29,70
and learning how to improve
your own health and be healthy.

72
00:06:31,26 --> 00:06:37,58
Not waiting until you get sick and then
going to see a so-called expert who.

73
00:06:39,10 --> 00:06:41,89
Attempts to manage your
situation with drugs

74
00:06:41,89 --> 00:06:47,01
or surgery.

75
00:06:47,03 --> 00:06:58,49
Fringe.

76
00:06:58,50 --> 00:07:02,84
A lot of.

77
00:07:02,86 --> 00:07:12,83
Times.

78
00:07:13,96 --> 00:07:14,11
Well.

79
00:07:14,80 --> 00:07:18,18
Basically i think there's growing acceptance
of natural therapies simply because

80
00:07:18,18 --> 00:07:24,01
they work. That's why they won't go away
and and the ones that stick with us

81
00:07:24,01 --> 00:07:24,54
and the ones

82
00:07:24,54 --> 00:07:29,65
that are becoming gradually mainstream
such such as chiropractic which you now go

83
00:07:29,65 --> 00:07:35,17
to university to learn and you become
qualified as a doctor of chiropractic.

84
00:07:35,19 --> 00:07:36,91
That's happened because it's valid

85
00:07:36,91 --> 00:07:41,19
and it works it's better than the
orthodox medical approach to lots of back

86
00:07:41,19 --> 00:07:46,76
complaints and that's been
proven now by research.

87
00:07:46,78 --> 00:07:51,38
And of course they've been ordered natural
therapies which haven't attracted much

88
00:07:51,38 --> 00:07:57,67
interest haven't been particularly
successful and they have fallen away.

89
00:07:57,68 --> 00:07:59,90
When i'm trying to think
of as an example where.

90
00:08:03,93 --> 00:08:06,79
No i've lost can't think of that.

91
00:08:09,51 --> 00:08:13,54
But the mainstream therapies no such
as herbal medicine and acupuncture

92
00:08:13,54 --> 00:08:16,02
and homoeopathy have stayed with us.

93
00:08:16,07 --> 00:08:17,85
And indeed growing because
they're effective

94
00:08:18,88 --> 00:08:23,61
and even within the ranks of the medical
profession itself now we have a growing

95
00:08:23,61 --> 00:08:28,06
numbers of young doctors who
are taking up these therapies.

96
00:08:28,08 --> 00:08:32,80
And taking up the concept also of holistic
medicine which is to treat the whole

97
00:08:32,80 --> 00:08:39,23
person to interact with the whole person
during the process of a of a therapeutic

98
00:08:39,23 --> 00:08:43,22
consultation and.

99
00:08:43,24 --> 00:08:47,38
Along with that has come the advent of the
multi-disciplinary clinic where you get.

100
00:08:49,37 --> 00:08:52,70
Medical doctors working
alongside natural therapists

101
00:08:52,70 --> 00:08:55,77
and psychologists for
example in a group practice

102
00:08:55,77 --> 00:09:00,41
and referring clients to each other according
to what would be the most suitable

103
00:09:00,41 --> 00:09:04,18
approach.

104
00:09:05,25 --> 00:09:15,71
Those things.

105
00:09:16,66 --> 00:09:21,09
I think industry near it's fairly unique
in terms of the world in australia

106
00:09:21,09 --> 00:09:25,38
and we have developed. Well i'm a
natural power so that's the field

107
00:09:25,38 --> 00:09:26,34
that i know the best

108
00:09:26,34 --> 00:09:31,84
but we have developed a kind of synthesis
of various natural therapies which hasn't

109
00:09:31,84 --> 00:09:36,74
occurred widely elsewhere in the world
in naturopathy study herbal medicine

110
00:09:36,74 --> 00:09:40,44
homoeopathy nutrition
vytorin and mineral therapy

111
00:09:40,44 --> 00:09:46,74
and so you have a combined approach
and it's very effective and.

112
00:09:48,30 --> 00:09:48,66
Because of

113
00:09:48,66 --> 00:09:52,93
that we have i mean there have been a
number of studies particularly in victoria

114
00:09:52,93 --> 00:09:56,21
or inquiries i should say
government inquiries

115
00:09:56,21 --> 00:09:58,93
and some research which
is proven that that.

116
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,40
The outcomes of natural therapies patients
are very happy with them natural passive

117
00:10:04,40 --> 00:10:06,56
the least number of
complaints to the consumers.

118
00:10:07,26 --> 00:10:08,58
Complaint department

119
00:10:10,21 --> 00:10:14,64
and.

120
00:10:16,01 --> 00:10:21,59
Drive them. You have
to get me going again.

121
00:10:24,97 --> 00:10:37,97
Fringe elements we were
talking about places.

122
00:10:39,04 --> 00:10:42,98
Apart from the the major mode allergies
which i've already talked about there are

123
00:10:42,98 --> 00:10:49,16
lots of sort of other theories that kind
of on the fringe of natural need is

124
00:10:49,16 --> 00:10:55,65
and such as crystal healing and rebirthing
in all of those sorts of things

125
00:10:55,65 --> 00:11:02,04
that are abundant in this area.

126
00:11:02,06 --> 00:11:08,22
I personally think that that healing is
a very sort of individual and creative

127
00:11:08,22 --> 00:11:12,09
but in one aspect of it one
end of it's spectrum and

128
00:11:13,55 --> 00:11:20,02
that out of the community at a grassroots
level periodically spring through some

129
00:11:20,02 --> 00:11:24,59
individual a new theory p and
an example of that is they

130
00:11:24,59 --> 00:11:27,66
and their p which was developed
by a man called tombo

131
00:11:27,66 --> 00:11:32,58
and down in geelong who was just
a very intuitive body worker

132
00:11:32,58 --> 00:11:39,18
and developed a sort of soft tissue
type of approach to all sorts of back

133
00:11:39,18 --> 00:11:43,72
muscular and joint problems and
his approach is now being taught

134
00:11:43,72 --> 00:11:44,96
and it's very successful.

135
00:11:44,98 --> 00:11:47,85
So that's just an example and i think

136
00:11:47,85 --> 00:11:53,96
that we we always have
to to remain open to.

137
00:11:53,98 --> 00:11:59,58
The birth in a sense of the new
therapies. Into the world and.

138
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,48
Those that are not valid for
the way and those that.

139
00:12:03,49 --> 00:12:04,98
Develop and grow

140
00:12:04,98 --> 00:12:11,61
and eventually become a widely practiced
therapy i mean this was the case with

141
00:12:11,61 --> 00:12:15,72
chiropractic for example in america.

142
00:12:15,74 --> 00:12:17,97
Developed by a man called palmer

143
00:12:19,25 --> 00:12:26,19
and he was not a trained
medical practitioner.

144
00:12:27,50 --> 00:12:29,16
And i suppose over sounds of years

145
00:12:29,16 --> 00:12:34,52
that all sorts of therapies have initially
begun with one individual who was

146
00:12:34,53 --> 00:12:38,95
fascinated by healing and somehow
the vision came to them suddenly

147
00:12:38,96 --> 00:12:42,37
or gradually of how to go about
developing a particular approach

148
00:12:43,43 --> 00:12:54,76
and then other people learn it.

149
00:12:55,72 --> 00:12:57,46
Ok.

150
00:12:58,41 --> 00:13:02,25
You get a lot of different terms for
natural therapies such as complementary

151
00:13:02,25 --> 00:13:07,05
medicine which is the term that's increasingly
being used for the six major modelo

152
00:13:07,05 --> 00:13:12,60
ts also alternative medicine.
But that's becoming.

153
00:13:13,10 --> 00:13:17,01
Kind of less popular because
it's sort of divisive.

154
00:13:18,63 --> 00:13:22,00
Another term is holistic meters
and that's a particular term

155
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:28,43
that has been taken up within the
medical profession and nursing and.

156
00:13:28,45 --> 00:13:33,87
There is certainly a growing group within
those orthodox professions a kind of

157
00:13:33,87 --> 00:13:37,88
breakaway group which is developing
what they call holistic meds

158
00:13:37,88 --> 00:13:44,06
and within their frame of reference holistic
medicine is the way you approach the

159
00:13:44,06 --> 00:13:46,29
client of the kind of
interaction that you have

160
00:13:46,29 --> 00:13:50,56
that instead of just the doctor sitting
across the desk from a patient who is just

161
00:13:50,56 --> 00:13:54,16
a physical entity or a machine
made up of running parts

162
00:13:55,10 --> 00:13:59,70
that the holistic doctor recognises
that he is talking to a person with.

163
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,97
Emotional spiritual and mental components
or energy fields you could say.

164
00:14:07,14 --> 00:14:11,23
And so the holistic
practitioner not any doctors

165
00:14:11,23 --> 00:14:15,80
but natural therapists as well.

166
00:14:16,68 --> 00:14:19,71
Interacts with the client in
that way and sometimes when you

167
00:14:20,54 --> 00:14:23,87
when you open up a consultation.

168
00:14:24,75 --> 00:14:29,02
To include all those other
levels of being then.

169
00:14:30,26 --> 00:14:35,78
It allows a safe place for for
for example for expression of.

170
00:14:35,80 --> 00:14:36,60
Stress

171
00:14:36,60 --> 00:14:40,44
and emotional difficulties which have
been contributing to physical disorders.

172
00:14:40,54 --> 00:14:45,13
So that sometimes one doesn't
even need to prescribe anything.

173
00:14:45,89 --> 00:14:50,99
And. Healing can.

174
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:55,51
At the very least be helped along on a
new energetic level by the person being

175
00:14:55,51 --> 00:15:00,06
allowed to express the full spectrum of
these symptoms not just the physical ones

176
00:15:00,06 --> 00:15:02,60
but all the other things that are a part

177
00:15:02,60 --> 00:15:09,60
and parcel of the whole self.

178
00:15:09,62 --> 00:15:15,58
Is extremely different because.

179
00:15:16,30 --> 00:15:20,35
Holistic medicine is very different from
the traditional orthodox medical approach

180
00:15:20,35 --> 00:15:22,99
because.

181
00:15:23,00 --> 00:15:26,40
Orthodox medicine is based
on reductionist science and

182
00:15:26,40 --> 00:15:30,53
that developed out of the
cartesian philosophy.

183
00:15:31,73 --> 00:15:36,22
Of analysis we had by you only
believed what could absolutely

184
00:15:36,22 --> 00:15:39,92
and irrefutably be proven and.

185
00:15:39,93 --> 00:15:40,84
Within

186
00:15:40,84 --> 00:15:46,62
that context with our science as it is
we have largely only been able to prove

187
00:15:46,62 --> 00:15:51,50
things within the physical realm.

188
00:15:52,80 --> 00:15:55,37
Particularly within medical science
physics as a whole different matter

189
00:15:55,37 --> 00:15:59,21
and the new physics is
starting to affect us a whole.

190
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,41
It's society really and in different ways
but. That's a whole different matter.

191
00:16:07,13 --> 00:16:09,68
So the traditional doctor only
dwelled on the physical because

192
00:16:09,68 --> 00:16:15,74
that was the area only area which was in
which his medicine is proven can be proven

193
00:16:15,74 --> 00:16:19,10
to have predictable effects.

194
00:16:19,12 --> 00:16:24,90
And so he cannot ethically move
outside of that physical area.

195
00:16:25,31 --> 00:16:31,85
He's bound by that. According to
the tenets of scientific medicine.

196
00:16:33,32 --> 00:16:39,79
Of course you get individual doctors who
are real human beings with healing ability

197
00:16:39,79 --> 00:16:41,18
who do move outside of

198
00:16:41,18 --> 00:16:45,55
that room who spend time talking to people
particularly within the holistic medical

199
00:16:45,55 --> 00:16:45,99
movement

200
00:16:45,99 --> 00:16:52,69
but also there are other good doctors who
relate to people more widely now particularly

201
00:16:52,69 --> 00:16:53,80
because people demand that

202
00:16:53,80 --> 00:16:58,56
and shop around for doctors who
will treat them as people.

203
00:17:00,27 --> 00:17:14,71
So it is extremely different
holistic medicine.

204
00:17:17,03 --> 00:17:20,67
Yes. Ok.

205
00:17:22,03 --> 00:17:28,62
The basis of all systems of medicine
really is shamanic medicine which is

206
00:17:28,62 --> 00:17:34,81
right across the world in every continent
continent. They sickly similar.

207
00:17:34,83 --> 00:17:36,70
And the shaman.

208
00:17:38,02 --> 00:17:42,17
Is a sort of combination herbalist
and psychologist and priest

209
00:17:43,70 --> 00:17:47,49
and. We all started off like that.

210
00:17:47,59 --> 00:17:48,48
Thousands of years ago

211
00:17:49,20 --> 00:17:55,63
and then in areas of civilization such
as greece china india more sophisticated

212
00:17:56,32 --> 00:18:03,21
types of medicine came into being gradually
which. For example with her pocket is.

213
00:18:03,22 --> 00:18:05,99
Approached healing through.

214
00:18:07,81 --> 00:18:11,58
Diet herbal medicines climate exercise.

215
00:18:12,08 --> 00:18:16,26
Those sorts of areas and that was
the western tradition of medicine.

216
00:18:17,90 --> 00:18:20,73
For about 15.

217
00:18:20,81 --> 00:18:26,50
You know 2000 years probably.

218
00:18:28,48 --> 00:18:31,39
Until it was overturned
by the development of.

219
00:18:31,97 --> 00:18:33,97
Science particularly with descartes

220
00:18:33,97 --> 00:18:39,03
and his method of analysis.

221
00:18:39,04 --> 00:18:44,11
So we have in the west and we we have a
history of conflict between orthodox

222
00:18:44,11 --> 00:18:46,59
and unorthodox medicine which
didn't happen in india

223
00:18:46,59 --> 00:18:52,31
and china in china they had five thousand
years of uninterrupted development of

224
00:18:52,32 --> 00:18:57,84
their natural medicine and it's a very
sophisticated model in the western world.

225
00:18:58,17 --> 00:19:03,15
We had. Will probably the conflict
started about around about the year.

226
00:19:03,15 --> 00:19:03,52
Twelve hundred

227
00:19:03,52 --> 00:19:07,70
when the first universities came into being
in medicine shifted into the study of

228
00:19:07,70 --> 00:19:10,83
medicine shifted into the
university system and.

229
00:19:10,85 --> 00:19:17,41
There was the elite medical system practiced
by those who were university trained

230
00:19:17,41 --> 00:19:23,30
and their wealthy people who could patronise
them which was a minority of people

231
00:19:23,30 --> 00:19:29,14
and other than that there was
just grassroots folk medicine.

232
00:19:29,15 --> 00:19:35,30
And this situation went along for the
last eight hundred years with sort of

233
00:19:35,30 --> 00:19:39,17
vilification of folk medicine
by university trained people

234
00:19:39,17 --> 00:19:41,79
and you have to bear in mind that.

235
00:19:41,81 --> 00:19:45,56
Scientific medicine only began about
three hundred years ago so prior to

236
00:19:45,56 --> 00:19:49,08
that for hundreds of years we had
vilification of folk medicine because it was

237
00:19:50,67 --> 00:19:54,02
practiced by unlearned and people who
didn't know anything about philosophy

238
00:19:54,78 --> 00:20:02,12
or didn't speak latin didn't know
the theories of gaiman. Etc..

239
00:20:02,14 --> 00:20:06,69
So it's interesting a sociologically that
there's been that split that hasn't.

240
00:20:07,02 --> 00:20:13,60
Rested on science at all science with a
useful tool for them to rest upon to

241
00:20:13,60 --> 00:20:17,37
further denigrate natural medicine.

242
00:20:18,12 --> 00:20:27,09
But that's changing too gradually.

243
00:20:28,23 --> 00:20:32,67
As.

244
00:20:32,68 --> 00:20:35,60
Well in this area in.

245
00:20:35,62 --> 00:20:39,79
Lismore because of the wide community
interest in natural medicine

246
00:20:39,79 --> 00:20:44,11
and because we have a university
here which is fairly entrepreneurial

247
00:20:44,11 --> 00:20:49,20
and interested in reflecting
community. Interests.

248
00:20:49,76 --> 00:20:54,61
They have approved a three year
curriculum for a bachelor's degree in

249
00:20:54,61 --> 00:20:58,26
that year obviously and also similar i
think in traditional chinese medicine.

250
00:20:59,55 --> 00:21:04,35
So those courses are actually
approved but not yet funded and.

251
00:21:04,37 --> 00:21:09,21
Funding could be some years away that
it's really a fascinating development

252
00:21:09,21 --> 00:21:09,88
and if it.

253
00:21:09,97 --> 00:21:14,88
If we get naturopathy into the university
here will be to my knowledge of first in

254
00:21:14,88 --> 00:21:17,33
the western world.

255
00:21:18,71 --> 00:21:24,62
And it will mean that for the first
time in eight hundred years.

256
00:21:25,55 --> 00:21:31,02
The traditional medicine will move much
closer to a place of equality with.

257
00:21:31,44 --> 00:21:36,75
A lead orthodox medicine and that is a.

258
00:21:38,04 --> 00:21:42,61
A fascinating development
and. So much potential.

259
00:21:44,21 --> 00:21:50,42
Possible.

260
00:21:51,87 --> 00:21:53,76
Progress.

261
00:21:54,93 --> 00:21:59,53
In australia.

262
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,86
I think nimbin is been very important in
the development of natural therapies in

263
00:22:03,86 --> 00:22:08,16
this area.

264
00:22:08,17 --> 00:22:08,98
I don't think

265
00:22:08,98 --> 00:22:15,80
that it's been an impetus australia wide
because people who qualified natural

266
00:22:15,80 --> 00:22:18,04
therapist in this area
have trained elsewhere

267
00:22:18,04 --> 00:22:22,70
and there are very advanced centres of
natural medicine in melbourne sydney

268
00:22:23,44 --> 00:22:24,78
and brisbane particularly.

269
00:22:26,63 --> 00:22:32,01
But all of the training is private in
private colleges. You know that's not true.

270
00:22:32,35 --> 00:22:37,71
There are now university courses in
acupuncture in melbourne and perth i think

271
00:22:37,71 --> 00:22:43,22
and possibly sydney in chiropractic
in osteopathy in melbourne.

272
00:22:44,25 --> 00:22:49,24
This is a course starting up in brisbane
taste college next year in homoeopathy

273
00:22:49,24 --> 00:22:53,76
classical homoeopathy so it
certainly on the move in australia

274
00:22:53,76 --> 00:22:58,36
and i think that's why we're getting a
backlash of legislation. Happening.

275
00:22:59,59 --> 00:23:01,59
Particularly through the
therapeutic goods act

276
00:23:02,85 --> 00:23:08,71
but nimbin is interesting because of the
numbers of people who practice in not only

277
00:23:08,71 --> 00:23:10,87
neiman but the whole northern rivers ria.

278
00:23:11,39 --> 00:23:15,60
It's a real sort of hotbed
of natural medicine and.

279
00:23:17,17 --> 00:23:21,03
So it has the potential to
become a very important centre.

280
00:23:21,04 --> 00:23:26,01
If we get the university course here.

281
00:23:26,99 --> 00:23:32,53
Politics.

282
00:23:34,45 --> 00:23:35,89
Because.

283
00:23:38,52 --> 00:23:49,97
Isn't.

284
00:23:50,95 --> 00:23:54,02
Will the politics of health a
really fascinating and very complex

285
00:23:54,02 --> 00:23:59,89
but it's basically comes down to
a power struggle health care in.

286
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,30
This country is worth billions and it's a
vital component of our entire economy.

287
00:24:07,42 --> 00:24:11,88
And if suddenly overnight all the people
who could benefit from most from natural

288
00:24:11,88 --> 00:24:13,19
medicine was shifted out of

289
00:24:13,19 --> 00:24:16,97
that system probably our economy would
collapse because of its cause that's a

290
00:24:16,97 --> 00:24:20,26
hypothetical situation that
i just wanted to raise

291
00:24:20,26 --> 00:24:22,53
that point to show you how
important it is to our economy

292
00:24:22,53 --> 00:24:29,16
and consequently the control
of it is extremely important.

293
00:24:30,54 --> 00:24:33,50
And and the fact is that in australia.

294
00:24:33,86 --> 00:24:38,29
People are voting with their feet and
moving in their thousands every year.

295
00:24:39,83 --> 00:24:44,03
Towards natural medicine the australian
natural service association estimates now

296
00:24:44,03 --> 00:24:48,03
that there is something like 10 million
consultations with natural therapists in

297
00:24:48,03 --> 00:24:51,11
australia per year and

298
00:24:51,11 --> 00:24:55,21
that in fact this is actually saving our
country a lot of money in terms of the

299
00:24:55,21 --> 00:25:00,69
health dollar. Because it's all paid
for out of the private pocket and.

300
00:25:01,35 --> 00:25:05,51
It probably saves people surgery for example
it saves hospital days it gets people

301
00:25:05,51 --> 00:25:06,55
back to work quicker.

302
00:25:06,85 --> 00:25:11,38
And that's really all an unknown there
are sort of estimates made of what

303
00:25:11,38 --> 00:25:17,17
that is really worth but
no good research on it.

304
00:25:17,18 --> 00:25:21,49
So control of the health dollar.

305
00:25:23,64 --> 00:25:26,15
Is a major issue and.

306
00:25:26,17 --> 00:25:30,93
Because of the growing interest in
natural therapies in australia.

307
00:25:31,84 --> 00:25:32,98
Even within the medical profession.

308
00:25:34,51 --> 00:25:41,42
There's a backlash developing ever since
i've been involved in natural medicine in

309
00:25:41,42 --> 00:25:47,32
the last 20 years we've had one attempt
after another two to repress natural

310
00:25:47,32 --> 00:25:47,70
medicine

311
00:25:47,70 --> 00:25:52,79
and i mean back in the 70s in victoria they
wanted to ban us along with scientologists

312
00:25:52,79 --> 00:25:56,75
they put us into the same category.

313
00:25:56,77 --> 00:25:59,82
And they've been numerous
inquiries and again in victory.

314
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:06,75
Area where there's been the most activity
there was one attempt to control.

315
00:26:07,59 --> 00:26:09,45
Vardaman and and mineral syrupy

316
00:26:09,45 --> 00:26:13,60
and put it more substantially into the
hands of the medical profession and

317
00:26:13,60 --> 00:26:17,67
that provoked an enormous public
outcry they got more letters over

318
00:26:17,67 --> 00:26:20,42
that issue than any other issue.

319
00:26:20,44 --> 00:26:23,98
Politically and so
eventually they realised

320
00:26:23,98 --> 00:26:28,45
that they weren't going to succeed by
trying to squash the therapists themselves

321
00:26:28,45 --> 00:26:30,08
there was too much public support

322
00:26:32,01 --> 00:26:34,11
and also with each inquiry
they got less biased

323
00:26:34,11 --> 00:26:38,75
and actually more open more interested
in finding out what was really going on

324
00:26:39,82 --> 00:26:41,44
and so.

325
00:26:41,46 --> 00:26:45,87
The best one so far as been the victorian
social development committee an all party

326
00:26:45,87 --> 00:26:50,02
inquiry and they actually did
some good research into.

327
00:26:50,04 --> 00:26:53,10
Things like our standard of education.

328
00:26:55,10 --> 00:27:00,92
Patient satisfaction reasons why people go
to natural therapies all those sorts of

329
00:27:00,92 --> 00:27:04,68
things and it was a very
fair and worthwhile report.

330
00:27:05,08 --> 00:27:08,65
And interestingly they came up with the.

331
00:27:09,37 --> 00:27:12,63
Finding that we didn't need to be
registered because we do no harm.

332
00:27:15,81 --> 00:27:15,91
And

333
00:27:15,92 --> 00:27:19,67
that was a real disappointment to the natural
shape as we wanted to be realistic because

334
00:27:19,67 --> 00:27:22,65
we needed the protection
of a registration system.

335
00:27:24,49 --> 00:27:27,32
To protect us from orthodox medicine.

336
00:27:27,34 --> 00:27:33,19
But the inquiry in victoria
didn't perceive that as.

337
00:27:33,21 --> 00:27:39,85
They were looking into that.
So the tactics of shifted.

338
00:27:39,87 --> 00:27:43,23
We've now got the therapeutic goods
department which used to be different in each

339
00:27:43,23 --> 00:27:45,12
state and it because of that it was.

340
00:27:46,21 --> 00:27:48,15
The rules and regulations
were different in each state

341
00:27:48,15 --> 00:27:53,91
and it was a bit of a shame as all really
made interstate trade for example in

342
00:27:53,91 --> 00:27:56,53
natural therapies in the
manufacture difficult.

343
00:27:57,19 --> 00:27:59,59
Different labeling requirements
and all of that sort of thing.

344
00:28:00,78 --> 00:28:03,85
So they decided to make it a federal
department based in canberra.

345
00:28:04,55 --> 00:28:06,61
Which in lots of respects was a good idea.

346
00:28:07,97 --> 00:28:11,67
And it meant that everything could be sort
of standardised from one central area

347
00:28:11,67 --> 00:28:16,34
but having got the power
centralised in canberra.

348
00:28:16,57 --> 00:28:19,92
They then commenced to.

349
00:28:19,94 --> 00:28:24,40
Look at the contents of all
sorts of medicines and anything

350
00:28:24,41 --> 00:28:30,30
that they could band on the sort of
slightest pretext for example come free

351
00:28:30,30 --> 00:28:38,13
that if you age five bucketfuls of
country a day you would get ill.

352
00:28:38,15 --> 00:28:40,54
Anything they can possibly
banned as being banned.

353
00:28:41,04 --> 00:28:45,05
And it's an ongoing process
is not complete by any means.

354
00:28:46,85 --> 00:28:53,10
And. The tenets that they're using.

355
00:28:54,02 --> 00:28:56,73
The reasoning that they're
using to ban these medicines.

356
00:28:57,41 --> 00:29:04,06
Is based on the chemistry of herbs
according to the reductionist model is

357
00:29:04,06 --> 00:29:09,07
you break them down into component parts
you find out which parts are active

358
00:29:09,07 --> 00:29:13,24
and which parts are not which only depends
on what they can prove in the laboratory

359
00:29:14,66 --> 00:29:18,83
and if you find a particular ingredient
which is usually the alkaloids which may be

360
00:29:18,83 --> 00:29:25,64
dangerous in large quantities
that justifies its banning. But.

361
00:29:26,35 --> 00:29:33,01
Herbalists know that who works
because of the synthetic action by

362
00:29:33,01 --> 00:29:37,28
that meaning the combined action
of all of its different parts.

363
00:29:37,29 --> 00:29:40,40
In other words the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.

364
00:29:40,58 --> 00:29:46,03
And that when you put those
alkaloids back into the.

365
00:29:47,07 --> 00:29:50,46
Context of the living plant with all
its components that there are checks

366
00:29:50,46 --> 00:29:52,27
and balances within that.

367
00:29:52,79 --> 00:29:59,53
Meters and that the total
plant. Has a healing.

368
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:02,66
Power which is not been researched.

369
00:30:02,68 --> 00:30:07,57
They don't know why comfrey works or why.

370
00:30:07,59 --> 00:30:09,10
Goldenseal works

371
00:30:09,10 --> 00:30:14,99
or why most other whose works if there
has been some research now to show

372
00:30:14,99 --> 00:30:16,88
that things do work for example st.

373
00:30:16,88 --> 00:30:21,86
Mary's this or which is a
wonderful regenerator the liver.

374
00:30:21,88 --> 00:30:27,54
But the complexities of how there is herbs
actually go about creating this healing

375
00:30:27,54 --> 00:30:30,81
is not understood at all
so to ban them because

376
00:30:30,81 --> 00:30:32,61
when you break them down into parts

377
00:30:33,47 --> 00:30:37,88
and if you administered simply the alkaloids
in large quantities in a person would

378
00:30:37,88 --> 00:30:41,51
get you to herbalist is a nonsense.

379
00:30:42,24 --> 00:30:48,12
And we didn't we don't prescribe
comfrey by the bucketful and.

380
00:30:48,14 --> 00:30:51,98
And herbs are also prescribed in
combinations with each other.

381
00:30:52,18 --> 00:30:53,75
You really give one heard on its own.

382
00:30:53,94 --> 00:30:56,80
So if you give her a mixed
with 8 herbs in it.

383
00:30:57,63 --> 00:31:01,98
The complex of varying active ingredients
you know not only the alkaloids

384
00:31:01,98 --> 00:31:08,89
but the essential oils the proteins
all sorts of complex ingredients.

385
00:31:10,14 --> 00:31:15,41
The synergistic healing effect of
those can be perceived as an outcome

386
00:31:15,41 --> 00:31:16,80
but how it works. We don't know.

387
00:31:18,28 --> 00:31:19,34
So people medicine

388
00:31:19,34 --> 00:31:25,49
and homoeopathy has fallen into the hands
of a group of canberra scientists who are

389
00:31:25,49 --> 00:31:30,26
using their method to determine what we
are allowed to use and what we are not.

390
00:31:30,28 --> 00:31:35,10
As they see it as untrained people you
see because we don't have registration

391
00:31:35,10 --> 00:31:38,78
because we don't have university
education they consider

392
00:31:38,78 --> 00:31:40,12
that we are not to be trusted

393
00:31:41,19 --> 00:31:45,34
and the centuries of herbal tradition
which we learn is meaningless.

394
00:31:46,58 --> 00:31:49,63
Within the context of their science.

395
00:31:50,48 --> 00:31:53,84
And so we think it's very important for
us to keep fighting for university

396
00:31:53,84 --> 00:31:54,45
education and.
