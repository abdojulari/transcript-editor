1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:00,77
I'm talking to mrs.

2
00:00:00,77 --> 00:00:06,27
Vera holliday who as vera lawson worked
in the doormen long offices during the

3
00:00:06,27 --> 00:00:12,42
building of the rich do you remember
getting the job there. Yes i certainly do

4
00:00:12,42 --> 00:00:17,27
remember when the college rang and
said that they wanted me to go on

5
00:00:17,27 --> 00:00:22,60
a special. Position in sydney one of the
best positions in sydney at the time and

6
00:00:22,61 --> 00:00:27,52
could i be free straightaway.
And as i gave myself for

7
00:00:27,52 --> 00:00:33,40
a further three weeks i said well i think
you'll have to wait three weeks. And so

8
00:00:33,40 --> 00:00:40,30
i'm very fortunate i decided to wait three
weeks. And when i joined dawn in company

9
00:00:40,30 --> 00:00:47,24
in the chief industrial office which was
one of two offices twin offices the pay

10
00:00:47,24 --> 00:00:52,21
office was attached to this office and i
worked in both of them. Mostly in the

11
00:00:52,21 --> 00:00:57,43
chief industrial office with mr article
vincent who was the chief officer there but

12
00:00:57,44 --> 00:01:02,87
then on thursday and friday. I helped
mr alright he was the paymaster. With

13
00:01:02,87 --> 00:01:07,07
a pay sheet and on friday with
the page making up the page etc.

14
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:12,86
. There were some times when i would call
along to actually pay the men and that

15
00:01:12,87 --> 00:01:19,81
was quite an experience. Well and that's

16
00:01:19,81 --> 00:01:24,18
what really happened in the pay office but
in the chief industrial officers office

17
00:01:24,18 --> 00:01:31,03
. Every week he prepared the rise and
fall of wages which were just as

18
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:37,89
made. Between the hourly rate
which was paid to the men between

19
00:01:37,89 --> 00:01:41,52
doormen long and the public
works department. Mr.

20
00:01:41,52 --> 00:01:46,70
Vinson. Worked at the rates and i actually
did the calculations to each week and.

21
00:01:47,39 --> 00:01:50,27
The accountant from public
works department of mr.

22
00:01:50,27 --> 00:01:54,71
Armstrong who would come
down every occasion perhaps

23
00:01:54,71 --> 00:02:00,02
a fortnight or fortnightly if it was very
cold because we always had very beautiful

24
00:02:00,03 --> 00:02:04,26
coal fires in the winter and in the summer
time of course the office was very cool

25
00:02:04,26 --> 00:02:08,93
. It was one of the older buildings down
the doors point and in the summer time

26
00:02:08,93 --> 00:02:13,71
he'd come down because it was cool but he
did it work very well indeed for public

27
00:02:13,71 --> 00:02:20,07
works department. Well then i also kept
the wages records for the men both

28
00:02:21,12 --> 00:02:28,02
on the site in sydney and those of
my review and that was used. If the

29
00:02:28,02 --> 00:02:34,65
in for taxation purpose it and also in
worker's compensation when there was any

30
00:02:34,65 --> 00:02:41,28
accident on the bridge or or down at the
side. The compensation forms would be made

31
00:02:41,28 --> 00:02:45,94
out that the cause of the injury in the
sight of the injury and of course we had to

32
00:02:46,78 --> 00:02:53,29
work out the average weekly wage and
then i think paid two thirds of that

33
00:02:53,29 --> 00:03:00,15
compensation the kind drivers and of the
other men. Incidentally. As the kind went

34
00:03:01,01 --> 00:03:05,66
further up on the on the different
angles of the bridge that paid

35
00:03:05,66 --> 00:03:11,60
a greater rate. And the crane drivers would
have perhaps sometime seven lines of

36
00:03:11,60 --> 00:03:16,99
calculations on the way just shoot each
week depend how many hours they worked at

37
00:03:16,99 --> 00:03:23,27
it. Section as they went up. Do you remember
any of the workers compensation claims

38
00:03:23,27 --> 00:03:28,54
do you remember the accident. There were
thirteen accidents on the sydney side and

39
00:03:28,54 --> 00:03:35,22
there were three in the mirror
you cite. I have been tell of

40
00:03:35,22 --> 00:03:41,96
a lot of the very tragic accident or
thirteen fatal accidents and three fatal

41
00:03:41,96 --> 00:03:45,97
accidents and maria stand corrected. There
were many many other accidents of course

42
00:03:45,97 --> 00:03:51,07
but i'm speaking particularly fake it wasn't
one of course who felt the top of the

43
00:03:51,07 --> 00:03:55,20
pile on and and hit it. You went down. I
don't care to remember the result of that

44
00:03:55,20 --> 00:04:00,07
was. It was very very tragic you know
cause the many others. That fell.

45
00:04:02,56 --> 00:04:08,70
When who feel and struck feet first. Of
course he's his boots was boat believe they

46
00:04:08,70 --> 00:04:09,93
sort of came up his legs

47
00:04:09,93 --> 00:04:16,85
a split. There was another who
feel of face down and that was not

48
00:04:16,86 --> 00:04:21,69
at all. Nice to think about so i put those
well in the back of my memory the actual

49
00:04:21,69 --> 00:04:28,17
fact but i do pay tribute to those men who
did lose their lives on the bridge. What

50
00:04:28,17 --> 00:04:33,25
about them. Oh minor accidents do you see
you get any burns to do. Oh yes. The ones

51
00:04:33,25 --> 00:04:36,95
that i'm laughing now. I bet the poor
little rivet boy is that used to catch the

52
00:04:36,95 --> 00:04:38,43
rivets. Of course they have

53
00:04:38,43 --> 00:04:43,04
a very very clever catching rivets in in
tin cans and they had to be very accurate

54
00:04:43,04 --> 00:04:48,11
but of course the unexpected sometimes
happened that ship would come often that

55
00:04:48,11 --> 00:04:51,95
their trousers we will tucked into their
boots every day and again one would go

56
00:04:51,95 --> 00:04:56,83
into their boots and believe me that can
of water that was ready waiting for them

57
00:04:56,83 --> 00:05:00,49
to jump into was always very
welcome to them. You fill out

58
00:05:00,49 --> 00:05:05,100
a few of those compensation for the
years many of them but. It was

59
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,48
a wonderful period really because i was
quite young was twenty april 21st birthday

60
00:05:11,48 --> 00:05:18,15
on the bridge and the main with whom i work
today and they were absolute gentlemen

61
00:05:18,15 --> 00:05:25,05
and they just looked after me as brothers
and i just think they're just wonderful

62
00:05:25,05 --> 00:05:30,51
people. And as the years went on of course
our we were all interested in the bridge

63
00:05:30,51 --> 00:05:37,48
to the granite came and maria and the
pylons grew and my immediate chief was to

64
00:05:37,48 --> 00:05:41,69
be instant when anything was finished or
completed sufficiently that i could be

65
00:05:41,69 --> 00:05:48,24
taken. There he would take me out into the
site. And i remember gain up to the top

66
00:05:48,24 --> 00:05:52,68
of the abutment towers and just before they
were quite complete but their work was

67
00:05:52,68 --> 00:05:57,35
letters were still there and up to the
letters we with and up the letters we went

68
00:05:57,35 --> 00:06:01,58
of course and that was we had our photos
taken later with some of the girls in the

69
00:06:01,58 --> 00:06:07,46
general office but that was very much in
the raw and i was always pleased to go

70
00:06:07,46 --> 00:06:12,40
where there was one time when i'm afraid.
I had to say you know that when the arch

71
00:06:12,40 --> 00:06:17,37
was joined and the big mama drearily
came and he said to me. Come on be

72
00:06:17,37 --> 00:06:22,79
a commando at the top of the arch. And i
just couldn't i would have loved to have

73
00:06:22,79 --> 00:06:28,76
gone but i just couldn't because i've seen.
I had seen too many people too many men

74
00:06:28,76 --> 00:06:30,88
come down from their white faced when

75
00:06:30,88 --> 00:06:36,54
a sudden gust of wind did come. And they
did to hang on for dear life. And i

76
00:06:36,54 --> 00:06:39,53
thought well that could happen to
me and i'd rather be down here as

77
00:06:39,54 --> 00:06:45,06
a said before it hurts when you for. Did
you ever get taken out of the workshops at

78
00:06:45,06 --> 00:06:51,40
all. Oh yes yes several times. I was taken
over there when the central hager was

79
00:06:51,40 --> 00:06:56,85
completed and my chief took me over in the
launch. He said come on that before that

80
00:06:56,85 --> 00:06:58,65
goes up have a look at it and have

81
00:06:58,65 --> 00:07:03,05
a touch of it and so we went out and we saw
the central hangar and it seemed to go

82
00:07:03,05 --> 00:07:06,94
on forever as we were walking it was lying
and of course on the side and it seemed

83
00:07:06,94 --> 00:07:09,87
to go on forever but that was
indeed quite a privilege it was

84
00:07:09,87 --> 00:07:13,80
a privilege to be able to go through the
workshops and see the work that the men

85
00:07:13,80 --> 00:07:19,40
were doing it was such wonderful work and
such exacting work. The rivets. There are

86
00:07:19,40 --> 00:07:24,60
so many many rivets and each one had to
be perfect in this city. And they're all

87
00:07:24,60 --> 00:07:30,06
very very skilled to remember
what the wage bill for

88
00:07:30,06 --> 00:07:36,95
a week was the doorman long in those days
but i thousand pound and you know it's

89
00:07:36,95 --> 00:07:43,79
the. Very big wage bill that was the
sydney site of course there are better.

90
00:07:43,96 --> 00:07:49,01
Hundred fifty men there and actually about
250 down at maria. But the sydney wage

91
00:07:49,01 --> 00:07:55,87
bill averaged about 8000 pounds.
And as the paymaster stated

92
00:07:55,87 --> 00:08:00,41
in my reference that was an enormous wage
bill. How much did you get out of that.

93
00:08:01,41 --> 00:08:06,98
Well the average weekly
wage i think the wage

94
00:08:06,99 --> 00:08:12,33
a man wife and child was about three pounds
three pound. Five and i was fortunate

95
00:08:12,33 --> 00:08:17,50
enough to get four pounds five. At that
particular time my wages went up later.

96
00:08:18,81 --> 00:08:25,39
Here's a do in the invoices didn't you.
Oh i did the invoices from the u.s.

97
00:08:25,40 --> 00:08:32,18
From england. I checked. I'd
all the steel invoices that

98
00:08:32,18 --> 00:08:37,50
came from england. Or were sent to me
and i checked them. Of course with my

99
00:08:37,50 --> 00:08:41,17
theories tables and on the machines etc.

100
00:08:41,93 --> 00:08:45,98
And they were very interesting
interesting indeed as

101
00:08:45,98 --> 00:08:50,85
a matter fete. Because we could see the
port boats coming into the hall from the

102
00:08:50,85 --> 00:08:55,90
other side. You've had workshops and then
of course later on to get the i'd get the

103
00:08:55,90 --> 00:08:59,91
invoices for the steel that
was delivered and it made it

104
00:08:59,91 --> 00:09:04,87
a living thing i knew what was happening i
knew where the steel was going from the

105
00:09:04,87 --> 00:09:11,87
invoices etc and working was something

106
00:09:11,87 --> 00:09:17,84
that was alive. Came alive under my fingers.
Do you remember any social occasions

107
00:09:17,84 --> 00:09:20,01
while you were on the verge of

108
00:09:20,01 --> 00:09:24,58
a social occasion yes well it was almost
as though she occasion weekly because we

109
00:09:24,58 --> 00:09:30,50
used to alternate saturday mornings. As
far as the working was concerned but i

110
00:09:30,50 --> 00:09:34,82
didn't want to stay. However saturday morning
because. After we finished had lunch

111
00:09:34,82 --> 00:09:41,22
at twelve o'clock. Whatever time. Some of
us would always go so here. But of course

112
00:09:41,98 --> 00:09:48,68
. The first big social occasion was when
the archers joined. Really and your

113
00:09:48,68 --> 00:09:54,15
arch was joined the 19th of
august 1930. But mr innes gay was

114
00:09:54,15 --> 00:09:56,14
a dinner dance mistress of ennis gave us

115
00:09:56,14 --> 00:10:03,01
a dinner dance at the winter of hotel. On
the 4th of september 1030. And it was it

116
00:10:03,01 --> 00:10:09,09
was wonderful. Of course that the all
of the officers were invited. And

117
00:10:09,91 --> 00:10:16,81
a lot of the executives for their and
leading river do was there and his

118
00:10:16,81 --> 00:10:18,13
wife and many in

119
00:10:18,13 --> 00:10:24,97
a associated with doormen long. And
remember the foreman rigger who was it

120
00:10:24,97 --> 00:10:29,47
also appears in that picture.
Oh yes. And that was mr.

121
00:10:29,47 --> 00:10:30,75
Harris who's

122
00:10:30,76 --> 00:10:34,79
a little man but he get anywhere because
he was so small you get into all the most

123
00:10:34,79 --> 00:10:38,74
awkward corners and he was very active of
course he was everywhere and he loved to

124
00:10:38,74 --> 00:10:45,48
be known as the human fly. But yes i have
a picture of that occasion. Showing mr.

125
00:10:45,48 --> 00:10:49,19
Mrs. In it on the left hand side
and course mr. Alf marr. Mr.

126
00:10:49,19 --> 00:10:52,29
Innis. Was director of
construction of course mr.

127
00:10:52,29 --> 00:10:59,00
Alf martin was second in charge and on
the other side of the picture was mr.

128
00:10:59,00 --> 00:10:59,25
And mrs.

129
00:11:00,05 --> 00:11:06,85
. Cerar freeman who was and or many
of the others who were in executive

130
00:11:06,85 --> 00:11:09,05
positions there. But it was

131
00:11:09,05 --> 00:11:14,19
a very wonderful night for me because i
worked with them into the pay office and of

132
00:11:14,19 --> 00:11:20,44
course my chief and his offsider.
And i didn't take apart my

133
00:11:20,44 --> 00:11:27,16
boyfriend was in queensland. So they said
well you're out for the night our partner

134
00:11:27,16 --> 00:11:32,94
for the night and i went down there and
they sort of you. We we really are going to

135
00:11:32,94 --> 00:11:37,32
have a night tonight and i danced for
feet of i really did and it was such

136
00:11:37,32 --> 00:11:44,21
a thing of joy. I do. Very pretty
frock and i think of it as one

137
00:11:44,21 --> 00:11:50,00
of these wonderful nights that doesn't often
happen. Do you remember the test match

138
00:11:51,30 --> 00:11:57,10
. You know. Yes this is another
occasion as the as the.

139
00:11:59,11 --> 00:12:02,88
As it was drawing near the end of the bridges
and our association was drawing near

140
00:12:02,88 --> 00:12:09,79
. Just over was you know so to say
that so i remember the test magic.

141
00:12:09,83 --> 00:12:16,81
Indeed i do. It was just after one
of the english australian test match

142
00:12:16,81 --> 00:12:19,78
had been played in england
and of course we had

143
00:12:19,78 --> 00:12:24,97
a very very close victory but there we
worked in complete harmony in the office

144
00:12:24,97 --> 00:12:25,20
there was

145
00:12:25,20 --> 00:12:31,99
a lot of englishmen on the staff. But i
would say almost half and half. There was

146
00:12:31,99 --> 00:12:36,34
a great deal of rivalry of course. And of
course when we won. They said i will take

147
00:12:36,34 --> 00:12:38,23
you on any time we can win that was just

148
00:12:38,23 --> 00:12:44,24
a fluke. So of course. Mistreat us about
lee heard of this and he decided that we

149
00:12:44,24 --> 00:12:44,76
would have

150
00:12:44,76 --> 00:12:47,99
a test match well with the help of the
men in the workshops and the fabricating

151
00:12:47,99 --> 00:12:51,17
workshops. They made as an earner out of

152
00:12:51,17 --> 00:12:57,81
a ten billy type of thing which was about
fifteen or eighteen inches high and they

153
00:12:57,81 --> 00:13:04,39
painted it red and shaped at the same as
an urn and. Put the airship in height on

154
00:13:04,39 --> 00:13:10,57
the front of it and so better hundred of
us went up to fix tree picnic grounds at

155
00:13:10,57 --> 00:13:13,90
lane cove. And we had

156
00:13:13,90 --> 00:13:20,77
a test match there between the australian
pulp mills and the australian australians

157
00:13:20,77 --> 00:13:27,66
. And it was played with much enthusiasm
and the disgust of the englishmen we

158
00:13:27,66 --> 00:13:31,80
again one by one run but we
had a wonderful picnic in

159
00:13:31,80 --> 00:13:37,93
a very very happy day we had in mind of
course the fact that our days together were

160
00:13:38,77 --> 00:13:44,87
were very short and we were really
appreciating the company of our fellow work

161
00:13:44,87 --> 00:13:49,77
people and it was they were soon to be
spread all around the world the bridges to

162
00:13:49,77 --> 00:13:55,54
be built in koala lumpur and and. I think
over in auckland there was an out of one

163
00:13:55,54 --> 00:14:00,54
built and on the other side of the world
we just didn't know where we would each

164
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:05,02
end up in fact the. The
office manager he called mr.

165
00:14:05,02 --> 00:14:11,51
Crow. He called on me in auckland because
i had been sent over there by the time he

166
00:14:11,51 --> 00:14:16,43
finished to work with an other company
and he was the last of those who were

167
00:14:16,43 --> 00:14:23,13
returning to england. I think dorman
longstaff does anybody you particularly

168
00:14:23,13 --> 00:14:30,00
remember. All of them.
But the immediate ones i

169
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:34,65
must pay a tribute to my immediate
boss mr ask of instant. He was

170
00:14:34,65 --> 00:14:40,08
a chief industrial officer. There's
not very much said about him he did

171
00:14:40,08 --> 00:14:46,61
a very important. Work
for the win. Job. He he

172
00:14:46,62 --> 00:14:53,20
represented them in court. He went he
interpreted the war in other words he used to

173
00:14:53,20 --> 00:14:59,96
get the interpretations of the award and
work to those and anything at all to do

174
00:14:59,96 --> 00:15:02,06
with the court work. He had

175
00:15:02,07 --> 00:15:05,68
a pretty good work and then of course each
week he used to work out the difference

176
00:15:05,68 --> 00:15:11,60
between. The wage rate that were claim
between the public works department and

177
00:15:11,60 --> 00:15:14,38
doormen long and company and he was

178
00:15:14,38 --> 00:15:21,06
a man who was always on the job and
his advice was very helpful and

179
00:15:21,06 --> 00:15:27,73
his assistant mr cyril kelly. I killed
was wonderful. He was like yet another

180
00:15:27,73 --> 00:15:32,67
big brother to me he used to sit
opposite me. In the angle of

181
00:15:32,67 --> 00:15:37,91
a an l-shaped desk. I had vince on one side
of me to the right and kill in front of

182
00:15:37,91 --> 00:15:44,70
me and he he used to work there
just in front of me and we sort of

183
00:15:44,70 --> 00:15:49,38
chatter away and do our work and. Met fact
he'd go to the pictures with his fiance

184
00:15:49,38 --> 00:15:54,36
over tuesday night and on wednesday
morning. Intermittently through the morning

185
00:15:54,36 --> 00:15:58,89
he'd tell me little fragments of the of
the program and but it didn't mean to say

186
00:15:58,89 --> 00:16:05,19
we weren't doing our work we did our work
all of that. Yes thank you very much. Do

187
00:16:05,20 --> 00:16:12,04
you remember where you were when the
bridge was open. When the bridge was

188
00:16:12,04 --> 00:16:18,38
open i was on top of the bridge you caught
up in the official stand on the eight

189
00:16:18,38 --> 00:16:25,29
stand. We faced the official stand
and near to where the ribbon was.

190
00:16:25,31 --> 00:16:28,16
And of course my chief mr.

191
00:16:28,16 --> 00:16:31,29
Vincent was alongside of me. And we had

192
00:16:31,29 --> 00:16:36,33
a very good view of the precision and we
were able to watch it from approaching

193
00:16:36,33 --> 00:16:38,39
from the right and could see

194
00:16:38,39 --> 00:16:44,94
a long way down the approaches of
the bridge. And at one stage i saw

195
00:16:44,94 --> 00:16:48,24
horsemen approaching hadn't
seen him before but as

196
00:16:48,24 --> 00:16:53,67
a junior year i could see
that horseman and he gave

197
00:16:53,67 --> 00:16:58,18
a magnificent salute to the official
standard. I drew my chief's attention mr.

198
00:16:58,18 --> 00:17:04,94
Winters attention to him and something
made me watch him pass the stand and go

199
00:17:04,95 --> 00:17:10,68
to burst to my left. And approach the
ribbon and then suddenly up went you saw it

200
00:17:10,68 --> 00:17:12,69
and the ribbon was cut and down came mr.

201
00:17:12,69 --> 00:17:18,52
De groot. The captain de groot. I actually
saw that incident. Absolutely. So every

202
00:17:18,52 --> 00:17:24,20
little bit of it because i was so intrigued
with his magnificent horsemanship he

203
00:17:24,20 --> 00:17:28,63
looked as if he was just he in the
water just won that one and it was

204
00:17:28,63 --> 00:17:35,54
a matched. Astonishing thing that happened
right in front of my eyes. What do you

205
00:17:35,54 --> 00:17:41,08
think it is actions and just year astonishment
i didn't know what it was all about

206
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:48,70
didn't know what it was all about then.
But of course were you ever out of work

207
00:17:48,70 --> 00:17:55,69
after the bridge was finished. I was very
fortunate. No i was never out of work i

208
00:17:55,70 --> 00:17:56,06
had

209
00:17:56,06 --> 00:18:02,97
a skill that was in much demand and i
had two very very good references and i

210
00:18:02,97 --> 00:18:07,98
finished it. The bridge in july which was
on the seventh month and the bridge was

211
00:18:07,98 --> 00:18:14,71
that's frankly six months four months
after the bridge was opened and

212
00:18:17,03 --> 00:18:18,47
i was just about mr. Mr.

213
00:18:18,47 --> 00:18:24,38
Kerr with great regret used to say to the
one whose next man whose turn it was to

214
00:18:24,38 --> 00:18:30,79
go. Well i'm afraid it's your turn and he
knew he used nearly weep but the day i

215
00:18:30,79 --> 00:18:31,86
was called up there is

216
00:18:31,86 --> 00:18:36,17
a real varies and this is the time he said.
I'm afraid i'm going to sack the self

217
00:18:36,17 --> 00:18:39,54
very soon but right we
were talking there my mr.

218
00:18:39,54 --> 00:18:44,74
Vincent my chief and knocked at the
door and came in and he said there was

219
00:18:44,74 --> 00:18:47,30
a firm wanting me on telephone to offer me

220
00:18:47,30 --> 00:18:52,18
a position so that meant that i even
forgot to get a riff a reference from mr.

221
00:18:52,18 --> 00:18:53,43
Vinson. To be i went in such

222
00:18:53,43 --> 00:18:58,28
a hurry to another firm then i eventually
ended up with the atlantic union oil

223
00:18:58,28 --> 00:19:04,23
company in sydney and they transferred me
to their auckland branch and in charge of

224
00:19:04,23 --> 00:19:06,74
their sales tabulation so i
was over there for quite

225
00:19:06,74 --> 00:19:12,31
a ha. So you were never out of work. Did
you finished up at the at the bread so

226
00:19:12,31 --> 00:19:16,25
you've got your bridge workers back to do.
Yes i have my bridge workers badge and

227
00:19:16,25 --> 00:19:22,13
it's all polished up to
here tomorrow. You know.

228
00:19:23,72 --> 00:19:27,81
Do you think that the bridge workers of
those days were better than today. How did

229
00:19:27,81 --> 00:19:32,85
they work. The bridge workers of those
days were absolutely magnificent they did

230
00:19:32,85 --> 00:19:39,56
a good work. They really were they. They
worked sixty minutes for every hour that

231
00:19:39,56 --> 00:19:41,75
they were paid. Even mr.

232
00:19:41,75 --> 00:19:46,39
Lawrence in as the director of construction
were surprised at the quality of their

233
00:19:46,39 --> 00:19:53,37
workmanship and that was proved on november
twenty six 1929 when the record was

234
00:19:53,37 --> 00:19:59,75
broken for steel lifting the total lift
from farve am to five pm was five hundred

235
00:19:59,75 --> 00:20:04,46
seventy eight ten and the world's record
for that type of bridge was three hundred

236
00:20:04,46 --> 00:20:10,47
seventy turned which proved that our
workers were the best in the world. sixty.

237
00:20:12,15 --> 00:20:16,28

didn't get a reference but you did get
