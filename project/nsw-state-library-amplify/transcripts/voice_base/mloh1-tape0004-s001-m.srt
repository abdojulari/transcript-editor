1
00:00:01,69 --> 00:00:05,53
I'm talking to mr. Walter ellis who
worked on the sydney harbour bridge as

2
00:00:05,53 --> 00:00:07,42
a holder up to remember
getting the job there. Mr.

3
00:00:07,42 --> 00:00:14,42
Ellis. Yes i do. Yes. The former
ball maker. Sam harris asked me

4
00:00:14,42 --> 00:00:17,34
to come down to milton's
point depot and you give me

5
00:00:17,34 --> 00:00:23,80
a start. The first week that i was employed
there. I was running down bolts and

6
00:00:23,80 --> 00:00:30,56
nuts and griese in them for the upper
structure in that week i was told one

7
00:00:30,56 --> 00:00:36,70
morning by mr sam harris that i would be
going up in the cage to the top and he

8
00:00:36,70 --> 00:00:40,59
gave me my mate who was a riveter and mr.

9
00:00:40,59 --> 00:00:46,44
George stobart. As we went up
half way the crane driver.

10
00:00:47,92 --> 00:00:52,44
In his joking way deliberately let
the brake or and used to make

11
00:00:52,44 --> 00:00:58,86
a spence and i caught. I become terrified
of course other than that. Previously i

12
00:00:58,86 --> 00:01:01,53
would never climb any higher
than say a peach tree or

13
00:01:01,53 --> 00:01:07,82
a local tree. When i got to the top the
swivel of the hook was spending around

14
00:01:08,86 --> 00:01:14,37
. And i was that terrified i did not know
how i would get off eventually somebody

15
00:01:14,37 --> 00:01:20,99
help me out and through i
suppose bravado. I overcome the

16
00:01:20,99 --> 00:01:27,71
situation but my first job was more
terrifying than that traveled up and the

17
00:01:27,71 --> 00:01:29,29
cage. I was given

18
00:01:29,29 --> 00:01:34,20
a twenty eight pound hammer. So knock
adrift through the side plate at the bridge

19
00:01:34,20 --> 00:01:40,52
of the first chord which i did do and i
done it. Magnificently. From then on of

20
00:01:40,52 --> 00:01:46,93
course i grew up with the bridge and it
had no fears for me. Can you remember you

21
00:01:46,93 --> 00:01:49,78
were also holding up for a time when i was

22
00:01:49,78 --> 00:01:55,56
a holder upper for the full term from the
first section to the fourteen section

23
00:01:56,27 --> 00:02:00,64
with my mate. George stay about and what
was the job of holding up. How did you go

24
00:02:00,64 --> 00:02:05,84
about it while the job of holding up was
catching a rabbit in the bucket from

25
00:02:05,84 --> 00:02:11,62
a cooker. Which was white hot rivet
and i would put the rivet into

26
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:16,65
a hole hit it in with a hammer
and put the dolly which is

27
00:02:16,65 --> 00:02:23,34
a machine that would rattle the
river up for the ball and make it

28
00:02:23,34 --> 00:02:29,43
a river down on the other side and do you
remember or did you do in work at the

29
00:02:29,43 --> 00:02:35,71
chords at all. I worked inside the chords
what they call the stitch plates. Now the

30
00:02:35,71 --> 00:02:42,60
stitch plates were plates that joined two
chords together two sections together

31
00:02:42,60 --> 00:02:47,87
which held 100 idea rivets which are
five eighths of an inch in diameter.

32
00:02:49,75 --> 00:02:54,54
Now on these rivets. We have an inspector
who used to come up in the white coat

33
00:02:55,42 --> 00:02:55,50
with

34
00:02:55,51 --> 00:03:02,39
a small tack hammer one finger one side
and the tack and the other if it did make

35
00:03:02,40 --> 00:03:04,19
any movement. He would put

36
00:03:04,19 --> 00:03:09,78
a white cross on that rivet and we'd say
out of one hundred eighty. We'd have at

37
00:03:09,78 --> 00:03:14,78
least replace another forty and how did
you replace them. How do you cut them out

38
00:03:14,78 --> 00:03:20,69
first the way we cut them out was the river
though we'd use these riveting machine

39
00:03:21,71 --> 00:03:22,36
where the kind of

40
00:03:22,36 --> 00:03:28,83
a chisel which he would cut right through
the center of the rivet and then

41
00:03:29,93 --> 00:03:36,68
we'd put. A wad. Whether on the
end of the handle which i used to

42
00:03:36,68 --> 00:03:37,61
hit with

43
00:03:37,61 --> 00:03:43,00
a hammer. They were breaking side the
rivet all off and then we'd put the rivet

44
00:03:44,54 --> 00:03:48,72
hang onto the top of the river and knock
it right through and they would be

45
00:03:48,72 --> 00:03:54,18
replaced when the conditions like inside
the cord when you were working in the the

46
00:03:54,19 --> 00:04:00,30
conditions inside the cord
were rather hot and of course

47
00:04:01,33 --> 00:04:07,88
. With the slag coming off the
rivet you would get burnt your

48
00:04:07,88 --> 00:04:08,84
clothing would catch

49
00:04:08,84 --> 00:04:15,16
a light which of course you'd put out with
their gloves but in today's standards. I

50
00:04:15,16 --> 00:04:17,47
would not see an ironworker for

51
00:04:17,48 --> 00:04:23,55
a riveter working under those conditions.
What sort of washing conditions did you

52
00:04:23,55 --> 00:04:27,78
have you know how did you put your clothes
what to do what did you do for lunch and

53
00:04:27,78 --> 00:04:33,52
that sort of thing. Well for luncheon. You
could have your you take your lunch onto

54
00:04:33,52 --> 00:04:37,67
the bridge in the morning and have it out
there looking at the harbour and the

55
00:04:37,67 --> 00:04:44,25
boats buying by or here go down to mess
rooms conditions as far as changing

56
00:04:44,26 --> 00:04:50,29
or bathing or showering did not worry us
because we just walk off the job and go

57
00:04:50,29 --> 00:04:56,13
home. Do you remember where did you live
then at that particular time i lived in

58
00:04:56,13 --> 00:05:01,10
twenty six neutral street north sydney. I
didn't have to go to work. I'm not very

59
00:05:01,10 --> 00:05:07,66
far no walking distance. Do you member
anything any stories that of things that

60
00:05:07,66 --> 00:05:14,18
happened while you were up there. Well
one story was the beginning of the first

61
00:05:14,97 --> 00:05:16,20
chord was

62
00:05:16,21 --> 00:05:22,37
a man by the name of anderson who fell to
his step and they recovered his body. The

63
00:05:22,37 --> 00:05:26,00
following morning had a
son. Have a son. Here is

64
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:32,17
a young married man. I think at that
time he lived and now and. We were

65
00:05:33,66 --> 00:05:39,45
. I think i have it wrong. I always thought
that we went home that day but what

66
00:05:39,45 --> 00:05:42,52
they eventually tire me today.
Here was that we're gave one half

67
00:05:42,52 --> 00:05:48,81
a day's pay for his funeral. Here it
is and did live in narromine to stride

68
00:05:50,36 --> 00:05:55,99
. Do you did you see him fall. I did not
see him fall and he saw the commotion. You

69
00:05:56,00 --> 00:05:58,16
have an ear escapes yourself. I had

70
00:05:58,16 --> 00:06:05,06
a very near escape and this one. I
must impress on you was that. Halfway

71
00:06:05,07 --> 00:06:10,79
over on the middle section.
We were working on the

72
00:06:12,16 --> 00:06:16,89
laterals which is in the middle of the
bridge on the bottom section of the top

73
00:06:16,89 --> 00:06:19,14
chord and me being

74
00:06:19,14 --> 00:06:25,17
a holder upper. I caught the river this
morning the place in the hole for my mate

75
00:06:25,17 --> 00:06:30,95
to rivet down but unfortunately
i did not change my

76
00:06:32,48 --> 00:06:35,28
spike piece which is at the bottom of

77
00:06:35,28 --> 00:06:41,85
a piece of two inch water pipe must
be sharp to dig into the steel

78
00:06:43,09 --> 00:06:46,73
where the top section which
is the plunger holds

79
00:06:46,73 --> 00:06:51,68
a river that. Now this plant
this point being blunt.

80
00:06:54,05 --> 00:07:00,89
When i turn the trigger on for there to go
through for the plunger it skated but it

81
00:07:00,89 --> 00:07:07,70
took me with it and i went down from
the scaffolding roughly about six

82
00:07:07,70 --> 00:07:12,58
foot. Which i hung on like grim
death being so young vigorous

83
00:07:15,77 --> 00:07:22,01
. Nervous too. I think they were
riggers were in the vicinity

84
00:07:23,58 --> 00:07:29,79
and they came racing over and they pulled
me up by the rubber hose and i regain my

85
00:07:29,79 --> 00:07:35,73
footing on the scaffolding from then on of
course naturally i went home for the day

86
00:07:37,09 --> 00:07:43,61
the following morning i backed up again.
Cause you be going vigorous good reflexes

87
00:07:43,61 --> 00:07:49,92
. I was able to shape up the next day
without worrying about the day before you

88
00:07:49,93 --> 00:07:56,92
member any other hard any dangerous
incidents. Well the only other dangerous

89
00:07:56,92 --> 00:08:02,37
instance would be i never
actually seen anything but. On

90
00:08:02,37 --> 00:08:08,48
a windy day it was very dangerous that if
you wasn't careful you could be blown off

91
00:08:08,48 --> 00:08:15,33
the top of the cord. But of course i
suppose everybody realized this and we all

92
00:08:15,33 --> 00:08:19,98
took precautions against it. Jim rennie
humorous things any funny things that

93
00:08:19,98 --> 00:08:23,70
happened while you were working on the
bridge humorous things and funny things.

94
00:08:23,87 --> 00:08:30,00
Well the only humorous and funny things i
saw was when mamie johnson flew over the

95
00:08:30,00 --> 00:08:37,00
top of the harbour bridge and we all
waved our tills at it. If you want

96
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:43,18
to some humor senior. If you
can't think of anything else.

97
00:08:45,43 --> 00:08:52,36
Well that's right. Staying
on this. You can't

98
00:08:52,36 --> 00:08:58,29
have got. Staying in the same on the same
vein. We say. While you were up there.

99
00:08:58,70 --> 00:09:03,55
What we did. If you needed to go the
toilet for instance. Well that's

100
00:09:03,55 --> 00:09:10,51
a funny thing but the time it hit the
water. It would be descending rated. To

101
00:09:10,51 --> 00:09:16,20
be nothing left to take that's no one
of us four hundred thirty two feet.

102
00:09:17,51 --> 00:09:20,84
I'm not sure whether it's 4:30 to
from the railway or the bottom

103
00:09:20,84 --> 00:09:27,52
a barge. But i know it was four hundred
thirty two feet at hyde hyde. High tide.

104
00:09:28,97 --> 00:09:35,26
But if you done your business for you and
i did well by the time i got even halfway

105
00:09:35,26 --> 00:09:39,29
down it would be dispersed to go and i think
i can hear a plane going over sending.
