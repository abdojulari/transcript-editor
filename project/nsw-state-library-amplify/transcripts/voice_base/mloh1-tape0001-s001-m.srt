1
00:00:04,41 --> 00:00:09,49
Again i'm talking to mr. Jay lloyd
who worked for dorman long and co.

2
00:00:09,49 --> 00:00:14,27
In middlesbrough during the construction
of the sydney harbour bridge. Do you

3
00:00:14,27 --> 00:00:20,24
member that time do you most like. It was
yesterday. What did you do. Did you work

4
00:00:20,24 --> 00:00:21,39
in the workshop there was

5
00:00:21,39 --> 00:00:27,15
a drill and what did you what parts
you drill the potus is all about.

6
00:00:28,91 --> 00:00:35,12
On the bridge with the lewis had machine.
Drilled everything. So many fifth all was

7
00:00:35,12 --> 00:00:42,07
said that i don't go. But this is where
the five six players together. And

8
00:00:42,08 --> 00:00:43,91
they were brought out already drilled on

9
00:00:43,92 --> 00:00:49,44
a digital yes but what else was made in
dorman like all the sections of the flat

10
00:00:49,44 --> 00:00:56,41
work. I worked on the. On the foundations
of drill the uncles for the foundation.

11
00:00:56,80 --> 00:01:02,99
Like plimsoll managed by the
completed the bearings.

12
00:01:04,23 --> 00:01:10,00
And they were all set. It set mangle every
all up to be perfect and where did the

13
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:15,63
steel come from prompt things. At middlesbrough
will be yes. And do you remember

14
00:01:15,63 --> 00:01:19,99
where while you were drilling there with
the accuracy you had to work. You had to

15
00:01:19,99 --> 00:01:24,69
be everything you thought up to be
dead. And you said lou said jill

16
00:01:24,69 --> 00:01:29,43
a machine and were there with it any more
accurate than any other job he worked on

17
00:01:30,38 --> 00:01:34,40
you know it had to be perfect. He wasn't
perfect. It was no good. It was only

18
00:01:34,40 --> 00:01:37,97
a very small proportion of the
stuff that the steel that was

19
00:01:37,97 --> 00:01:43,59
a was worked in dorman long. Was it was
done in middlesborough wasn't it or not

20
00:01:43,59 --> 00:01:50,11
there's thousands of tons of it. I would
realize that that. Nearly seventy over

21
00:01:50,11 --> 00:01:51,36
seventy per cent of the steel came with

22
00:01:51,36 --> 00:01:55,19
a what i mean is. Was working drilling and
such like there wasn't an awful lot of

23
00:01:55,19 --> 00:02:01,43
that nearly all got in the bridge out it
middle. But most it came out here straight

24
00:02:01,43 --> 00:02:07,36
as plates didn't it as plates yes but say
we've all been drilled marked already for

25
00:02:07,36 --> 00:02:14,21
this embryonic idea. What else what
other parts. Did you work on that we

26
00:02:14,21 --> 00:02:20,07
started on the foundations first. And
we went on the flat where all the heavy

27
00:02:20,07 --> 00:02:24,42
plates that could be plants was that could
be drilled before he could bridge well

28
00:02:24,42 --> 00:02:26,16
before he's got

29
00:02:26,17 --> 00:02:31,58
a champ let on the top and the places that
you do. All right. But you have to be

30
00:02:31,58 --> 00:02:38,37
set to be set every fifty or was five or
like to get what you want. And i think you

31
00:02:38,37 --> 00:02:43,94
said perfect. And how long we
are working for dorman like

32
00:02:44,77 --> 00:02:51,10
1929. Tonight he said he's thirty three. I
mean what happened here. Not an accident

33
00:02:51,98 --> 00:02:58,09
. Could you tell us about that to me i
was off work. Just over eleven months

34
00:02:59,22 --> 00:03:01,46
and i could you get back on
work and i found we had job as

35
00:03:01,46 --> 00:03:07,74
a laborer and. It was three months
you just said. You can't you finish

36
00:03:08,97 --> 00:03:13,61
to get any compensation or anything
like. All i do i was up with

37
00:03:13,61 --> 00:03:15,69
a third i mean where does
that was that in the fort was

38
00:03:15,69 --> 00:03:22,57
a week. And how long for that. I
was up eleven months eleven months

39
00:03:22,57 --> 00:03:27,48
for me. And when they laid you off after
that nothing just just said to settle me

40
00:03:27,48 --> 00:03:32,36
want their cards finished what happened.
You then went on the means test on the

41
00:03:32,36 --> 00:03:34,24
door and did you get

42
00:03:34,24 --> 00:03:38,15
a doll. Yes got the door. What sort of
what was that all in england in those days

43
00:03:38,15 --> 00:03:45,10
shows that week that issues and week was
how high compared to here and here and on

44
00:03:45,10 --> 00:03:47,33
the means test. I got six times

45
00:03:47,33 --> 00:03:52,06
a week. Actually if i was work and i
was drawn thirty eight children. I was

46
00:03:52,06 --> 00:03:58,89
a week better off work and what i was on
the dole and paid the rent. A lot of money

47
00:03:58,89 --> 00:04:04,28
and there was this. Here they had coupons
that you have coupons there. Yes you got

48
00:04:04,28 --> 00:04:08,68
some money as well as coupons. So you got
you do all yes. Well here in new south

49
00:04:08,68 --> 00:04:13,12
wales they didn't get any they got very
very little money if anything it was all

50
00:04:13,12 --> 00:04:17,25
coupons you had nothing to pay the rent
with. That was we were actors was telling.

51
00:04:17,38 --> 00:04:21,95
I worked two years full time we had i
might five it natal quite of us six and

52
00:04:21,95 --> 00:04:26,02
that's mine. How much you get paid for
that. It worked out about ten percent no.

53
00:04:26,99 --> 00:04:30,86
When i worked the five nights that was
eighty four what i was and what were their

54
00:04:30,86 --> 00:04:36,29
working conditions like in the shops there.
The collet the chinese lab. Most of it

55
00:04:36,29 --> 00:04:40,47
was outside where you can see. Was there
any sort of fairly where to put your

56
00:04:40,47 --> 00:04:45,08
clothes or whatever to wash. No nothing.
And there was no lunchroom or anything

57
00:04:45,08 --> 00:04:52,02
like oh no just sit down from the emission
toilet while you work and. You can see

58
00:04:52,02 --> 00:04:56,80
what to do over long is like when they got
here. It was the worst thing. I think

59
00:04:56,80 --> 00:05:00,82
over going to be like we're starting
a dominant personally moment

60
00:05:00,82 --> 00:05:03,28
a lot of people. It was that was

61
00:05:03,29 --> 00:05:07,85
a lively ah but was the worst thing ever
done. And how like how long. Actually we

62
00:05:07,85 --> 00:05:11,92
working on the bridge work
three years three years it's

63
00:05:11,92 --> 00:05:16,53
a lot of steel. How many of you were there
working on on the bridge steelworks

64
00:05:17,67 --> 00:05:24,59
would be an 800 in the bridge. But all
working on the sydney harbour bridge

65
00:05:24,59 --> 00:05:26,30
was an island it was

66
00:05:26,30 --> 00:05:32,84
a bridge. But in the man is
it was would be what 800 men

67
00:05:33,81 --> 00:05:37,94
. And yet many of the people here who
worked in the workshops in australia they

68
00:05:37,94 --> 00:05:43,45
reckon that they did it all as far as the
processing of the steel. Did you know the

69
00:05:43,45 --> 00:05:49,84
bridge up as it what had and you steel plant
next to one another one of the men had

70
00:05:49,84 --> 00:05:56,79
come out the men that went
back went back as manager. And

71
00:05:56,80 --> 00:05:58,96
he brought that. Great buck is

72
00:05:58,96 --> 00:06:03,63
a bridge yard manager they come from the
martins worked on the bridge the woman is

73
00:06:03,63 --> 00:06:08,17
just oh dear oh yes i know henry and alfred
martin both or both worked here. Henry

74
00:06:08,17 --> 00:06:11,72
martin was a manager in the shops
here. He was a publication. He was

75
00:06:11,72 --> 00:06:15,91
a tablet maker and he's using yes and he
can back it but as you know the bridge had

76
00:06:17,06 --> 00:06:23,85
it all to block the he was the diplomat
of the. General manager of diamond works

77
00:06:24,77 --> 00:06:29,65
. Do you remember them before the they
came out here to you didn't but my father

78
00:06:29,65 --> 00:06:36,64
did. What work in class people
with the martin. But they were

79
00:06:36,64 --> 00:06:41,37
hard nonetheless. And he was a
hard man to work for and he was

80
00:06:41,37 --> 00:06:47,81
a bad mother worked for my pals
as a diplomat and he was like mr.

81
00:06:47,81 --> 00:06:51,00
Hauck. There was

82
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:57,87
a little drink with them. What was how
long we are out of work during the

83
00:06:57,87 --> 00:06:59,04
depression after you finished up

84
00:06:59,04 --> 00:07:05,36
a terminal. 1930 to kill people. Yes

85
00:07:06,89 --> 00:07:06,90
that's

86
00:07:06,91 --> 00:07:12,92
a long time to start back on the docks
and do you make out reasonably then the

87
00:07:12,92 --> 00:07:19,46
docks. If you're going to the jungle welfare
was well it was just i mean pens. All

88
00:07:19,46 --> 00:07:24,49
in pens maybe fifty amount fight but you
know. If they have days were quite of

89
00:07:24,49 --> 00:07:28,29
a day's work. That's like what they
call toeing the line here twice

90
00:07:28,29 --> 00:07:33,78
a day. That's right. So it was the same.
Five times they did middle six o'clock

91
00:07:33,78 --> 00:07:38,71
eight o'clock different was started different
times you go through afterward. Every

92
00:07:38,71 --> 00:07:44,02
two hours six o'clock at night so we
need to get in permanent work again.

93
00:07:45,08 --> 00:07:46,78
thirty six. I've got

94
00:07:46,78 --> 00:07:53,63
a card on the devastating.
1936. That sounds hard

95
00:07:55,78 --> 00:07:58,23
. Anything else stands out in your mind.
Well you while you were working in the

96
00:07:58,23 --> 00:08:03,92
shop there for tom and sam so you may
think that once that i didn't have it. I

97
00:08:03,92 --> 00:08:09,72
don't need to because they gave a
bad. Thank you thank you. Us alone.
