1
00:00:09,29 --> 00:00:10,18
Ok.

2
00:00:10,20 --> 00:00:17,10
The classic had an ism of membrane
is not the head an ism of new york

3
00:00:17,10 --> 00:00:23,31
or london or paris or
cairo or wherever. But.

4
00:00:23,33 --> 00:00:27,98
Full moon nights and the fruits of
your own vine. Delicious trees.

5
00:00:28,37 --> 00:00:33,81
I mean the sister act.

6
00:00:33,83 --> 00:00:39,06
Healthy living beautifully prepared

7
00:00:39,06 --> 00:00:42,85
and presented vegetarian fact.

8
00:00:43,46 --> 00:00:48,15
I think one talks of food

9
00:00:48,15 --> 00:00:54,54
and lentils as being the food of
other non-meat eating culture

10
00:00:54,54 --> 00:00:55,83
and i can assure you

11
00:00:55,83 --> 00:01:00,69
that we eat well we home brew

12
00:01:02,28 --> 00:01:07,84
and. And herbal teas herbal teas etc.

13
00:01:07,84 --> 00:01:09,72
Tingle.

14
00:01:09,74 --> 00:01:14,84
And and of course the dope smoking and
that and the mushrooms and things

15
00:01:14,84 --> 00:01:19,33
and certainly in early
days of nimbin they.

16
00:01:20,50 --> 00:01:24,92
That that was that the bout
that the sum total of any any.

17
00:01:24,93 --> 00:01:30,54
Drug taking that that that i was aware of
and and i will say this that i grew up

18
00:01:30,54 --> 00:01:32,60
or i lived in then been.

19
00:01:33,15 --> 00:01:39,11
For those 17 years i have lived in
those and i and i was a non-smoker.

20
00:01:39,13 --> 00:01:41,28
I was you know to.

21
00:01:41,69 --> 00:01:48,00
To to actually still be amongst some
fairly entrenched marijuana users

22
00:01:48,00 --> 00:01:53,62
and not to be a smoker was
quite threatening. I think.

23
00:01:54,44 --> 00:02:00,03
I was just allergic test. Some. No.

24
00:02:01,12 --> 00:02:03,43
And you can get your highs
in many many ways you know

25
00:02:03,43 --> 00:02:08,10
that the dancing the blue
knob hall and the dancers

26
00:02:08,10 --> 00:02:13,69
that we used to have a good i
call. Just had to be experienced.

27
00:02:13,79 --> 00:02:18,45
New year's eve in blue know who was
particularly if that fabulous and the year

28
00:02:18,45 --> 00:02:24,01
that. I know i don't know what year
john john and sue fox came with.

29
00:02:24,03 --> 00:02:30,49
Welfare state international but we built
the giant and and had the lanterns

30
00:02:30,49 --> 00:02:36,21
and and and the bonfire.
It was it was wonderful.

31
00:02:38,41 --> 00:02:38,52
And

32
00:02:38,52 --> 00:02:45,08
that was something that's come of nimbin
this is is the celebration the sharing.

33
00:02:46,03 --> 00:02:49,01
Both in births and in death.

34
00:02:50,49 --> 00:02:54,50
We've had deaths in in with children

35
00:02:54,50 --> 00:02:58,67
and other adults and.

36
00:02:58,68 --> 00:03:02,75
And even last year almost
exactly a year ago john

37
00:03:02,75 --> 00:03:09,13
and two fox came to visit
at us here in lismore

38
00:03:09,90 --> 00:03:14,68
and my father had died the
day before they arrived

39
00:03:15,57 --> 00:03:20,69
and they helped me prepare a
celebration of his passing.

40
00:03:22,31 --> 00:03:26,31
Which we held here in the garden and that
was just beautiful. And it was it was.

41
00:03:27,30 --> 00:03:31,45
Moving on from the the
rituals and ceremonies

42
00:03:31,45 --> 00:03:34,95
that we'd had an impact my children know

43
00:03:34,95 --> 00:03:38,61
when they moved in the naming ceremony.

44
00:03:39,44 --> 00:03:43,13
So to celebration.

45
00:03:44,31 --> 00:03:46,94
May be had in this and had
an ism is a hard one.

46
00:03:47,03 --> 00:03:52,54
It's just delightful delightful
delights and earthly delights.

47
00:03:52,97 --> 00:03:59,15
It's how i remember it. And i suppose for
perhaps. Being in the in the mama role.

48
00:04:01,80 --> 00:04:04,94
It was it like my life
was somewhat tempered by

49
00:04:04,94 --> 00:04:07,95
that didn't stop me from dancing my.

50
00:04:07,97 --> 00:04:14,24
My pregnant belly off night after night.

51
00:04:15,42 --> 00:04:21,85
You know. Wonderful night. Amazing men.

52
00:04:21,87 --> 00:04:23,49
Oh oh.

53
00:04:26,71 --> 00:04:29,60
Oh this fern and free and friendship tony.

54
00:04:30,01 --> 00:04:33,72
And sonny and.

55
00:04:35,71 --> 00:04:41,99
John i and.

56
00:04:43,50 --> 00:04:47,86
Mirada indian names aboriginal names.

57
00:04:49,96 --> 00:04:54,36
South american names all sorts
of things flowers trees.

58
00:04:54,62 --> 00:05:06,86
Peter amazing things i can't remember.

59
00:05:07,62 --> 00:05:10,74
The name.

60
00:05:10,75 --> 00:05:16,69
The idea of naming the names of the children
or finding the names of the children.

61
00:05:16,96 --> 00:05:20,49
I was again.

62
00:05:22,43 --> 00:05:27,39
Relating to how how we
felt about where we were.

63
00:05:28,74 --> 00:05:34,73
And perhaps rejection of the citizens
and the johns and the david and so on.

64
00:05:36,68 --> 00:05:39,28
And finding names that had meaning.

65
00:05:39,30 --> 00:05:40,32
Many children

66
00:05:40,32 --> 00:05:46,96
when a md because of the meaning of their
their name because there was a strong.

67
00:05:46,98 --> 00:05:52,78
Indian tibetan american indian influence.

68
00:05:52,80 --> 00:05:59,79
On the spirituality of the people. So people
had you know. Virginity type names or.

69
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:01,45
Or would his name.

70
00:06:01,54 --> 00:06:08,24
So south american in the environmental
movement led to children having names of

71
00:06:08,24 --> 00:06:13,66
trees and and and animals so.

72
00:06:13,67 --> 00:06:16,13
Perhaps.

73
00:06:16,15 --> 00:06:20,04
Being being interested in and
reclaiming different cultures

74
00:06:20,04 --> 00:06:21,69
and searching for a culture.

75
00:06:21,72 --> 00:06:27,05
I think that we we took him tested out

76
00:06:27,05 --> 00:06:29,51
and checked out all the other cultures

77
00:06:29,51 --> 00:06:36,10
that were not the western white
protestant ethic anything but.

78
00:06:36,99 --> 00:06:39,67
So you know people there
was a south america.

79
00:06:39,68 --> 00:06:43,12
There was the american indian it was the.

80
00:06:44,37 --> 00:06:50,63
The the indian. Tibetan buddhist.
Also it's a different cultures with.

81
00:06:51,13 --> 00:06:55,70
Were examined and looked at and bits were
taken from him but so taken to hear that.

82
00:06:55,76 --> 00:06:57,76
From there that that.

83
00:06:59,06 --> 00:07:02,65
Went up to build the culture
that's developed in this area

84
00:07:02,65 --> 00:07:06,30
and.

85
00:07:07,73 --> 00:07:14,30
Bring it. For.

86
00:07:14,32 --> 00:07:15,87
Oh yes.

87
00:07:16,94 --> 00:07:20,56
Again from the sublime to the ridiculous
you can only it's like what i was saying

88
00:07:20,56 --> 00:07:26,07
before about having to go all the way i
mean if you look at these sort of you go to

89
00:07:26,07 --> 00:07:29,19
some of these conferences and things
that they have now these set conferences

90
00:07:29,19 --> 00:07:33,49
and and you know that that the big
multinationals and and the banks

91
00:07:33,49 --> 00:07:36,55
and the government and even the
public service have now and you have.

92
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:42,46
You have a brainstorm. You
know. And in the brainstorm.

93
00:07:42,52 --> 00:07:46,57
They say the wildest ideas you've got you
know all these people get paid thousands

94
00:07:46,57 --> 00:07:52,07
and thousands of dollars for doing these
these consultancies you know letting go

95
00:07:52,08 --> 00:07:55,62
and you know just let your minds
go free of the wildest ideas

96
00:07:55,62 --> 00:07:57,86
and then from there we can find something.

97
00:07:57,89 --> 00:07:59,91
It's only if you let your
mind go free and you let me.

98
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,78
At the ultimate that you get something
solutions. Alternative that he's no debt.

99
00:08:05,80 --> 00:08:11,36
You know. Conferences and
your consultants no live.

100
00:08:12,42 --> 00:08:18,31
Doing that things like you know. We which
we are allowed to to push the limits.

101
00:08:18,34 --> 00:08:20,23
You know because it's only
by pushing the limits

102
00:08:20,23 --> 00:08:23,51
that you actually find something
otherwise you live in mediocrity if you.

103
00:08:23,53 --> 00:08:29,35
You know it's sort of like if you don't.
If you don't go out a little bit further.

104
00:08:29,57 --> 00:08:40,71
You're not going to see the view.

105
00:08:40,73 --> 00:08:47,67
I can't think of any favorites. I mean.

106
00:08:47,69 --> 00:08:53,85
Jenny delsea recon turn.
Hadn't thought about.

107
00:08:53,87 --> 00:08:59,69
Fun in the ministry. Some of the houses.

108
00:09:01,02 --> 00:09:04,52
I mean when you're talking about pushing
the limits it's some of the houses

109
00:09:04,52 --> 00:09:09,62
that people built you know
from. From tepees to.

110
00:09:10,29 --> 00:09:13,01
To houses made out of.

111
00:09:13,03 --> 00:09:20,46
Aluminium plates from printed.

112
00:09:20,47 --> 00:09:26,10
Recycling you know just the amazing things
that people could do it with cycling.

113
00:09:27,19 --> 00:09:31,67
Peter pedals and his and his
bicycle technology you know.

114
00:09:31,68 --> 00:09:37,12
The idea of you know making
smoothies on a bicycle.

115
00:09:38,97 --> 00:09:41,01
Pedal power.

116
00:09:41,03 --> 00:09:44,29
Those those things then can be refined

117
00:09:44,29 --> 00:09:50,30
and turned into two really usable things.

118
00:09:50,32 --> 00:09:55,38
People do was it was a guy who used to go
around the streets and wearing dresses

119
00:09:55,38 --> 00:09:59,89
and hats from st vinnies and made
made puppets from from twig.

120
00:10:00,89 --> 00:10:02,43
And i can't remember his name.

121
00:10:02,79 --> 00:10:08,12
I mean he was he was excentric campus
but he was he told wonderful stories

122
00:10:08,12 --> 00:10:11,41
and then people know.

123
00:10:11,42 --> 00:10:17,35
And and allow that space for
for for telling the story.

124
00:10:18,37 --> 00:10:18,96
The community.

125
00:10:18,99 --> 00:10:22,35
You know just just oh you can't have all
these people from all these different

126
00:10:22,35 --> 00:10:25,50
groups and things coming
together and living.

127
00:10:25,52 --> 00:10:30,89
Successfully and people have done it.

128
00:10:32,06 --> 00:10:34,76
For a great.

129
00:10:36,02 --> 00:10:36,91
I mean i mean areas

130
00:10:36,91 --> 00:10:43,04
and so one of the attributes of an aries
is is to be pioneering to be in on the

131
00:10:43,04 --> 00:10:49,49
ground floor of the things and
that was what i was i did a lot

132
00:10:49,49 --> 00:10:53,58
and then been that they're going to
that's what i did a lot in limbo.

133
00:10:54,83 --> 00:11:00,14
And was involved in the setting up of
a number of the the community groups

134
00:11:00,15 --> 00:11:02,79
that are organizations activities
that are still happening.

135
00:11:04,33 --> 00:11:05,66
We talked about birth and beyond.

136
00:11:06,58 --> 00:11:07,69
And i was involved in that

137
00:11:07,69 --> 00:11:14,58
and very early days i was involved
in the home builders association in

138
00:11:14,59 --> 00:11:19,85
my my female capacity.

139
00:11:19,87 --> 00:11:26,33
In the community school i was my my
children were some of the first first

140
00:11:26,33 --> 00:11:29,64
children to go to the community school.

141
00:11:29,66 --> 00:11:36,42
And was was involved in the various committees
that we set up to to get that going.

142
00:11:37,21 --> 00:11:42,76
The co-anchor pre-school which isn't nimbin
but still run on in the same sort of.

143
00:11:42,78 --> 00:11:49,52
Lines. And yeah. So a lot of
the things that went on there.

144
00:11:49,54 --> 00:11:53,25
I i like to be i was involved in
like to think that i was there and

145
00:11:53,25 --> 00:11:59,82
that the early days. I've i've. I helped.

146
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,25
Two has is. The first house
with i was on shad land.

147
00:12:05,63 --> 00:12:08,39
Artillery in iraq with some dear friend

148
00:12:08,39 --> 00:12:11,03
that in elsbeth who i
first met in katmandu

149
00:12:14,05 --> 00:12:17,26
that all the world meets in them been to.

150
00:12:17,28 --> 00:12:21,76
And marcus and i built
that house together.

151
00:12:21,77 --> 00:12:26,67
And it was made entirely
of recycled materials.

152
00:12:27,88 --> 00:12:28,51
And was very beautiful

153
00:12:29,42 --> 00:12:35,47
and made ideas like we used
the poles were made from.

154
00:12:36,21 --> 00:12:37,79
Dead trees and.

155
00:12:37,81 --> 00:12:41,56
We thought that because the dead trees
had all been eaten up by white ants

156
00:12:41,56 --> 00:12:45,63
that we wouldn't have any problems with
white ants so we built the house with a

157
00:12:45,63 --> 00:12:48,64
pole straight into the ground not
wanting to use chemicals or the like.

158
00:12:48,85 --> 00:12:51,67
And the white ants thought
this was just wonderful.

159
00:12:51,87 --> 00:12:55,10
And so they used this is their
channels to go to to build up and

160
00:12:55,10 --> 00:12:57,03
and eat every other bit of the house and.

161
00:12:58,48 --> 00:13:06,04
Eventually sort of went back to the
earth it was a biodegradable house.

162
00:13:07,60 --> 00:13:10,95
And it was exquisite it was just
like a hansel and gretel house

163
00:13:10,95 --> 00:13:14,70
and covered in vines and
my babies who up there.

164
00:13:14,85 --> 00:13:20,01
It was beautiful and the other house

165
00:13:20,01 --> 00:13:22,83
that i built.

166
00:13:22,85 --> 00:13:29,81
Were is on my own title in
a village in a community

167
00:13:30,62 --> 00:13:34,64
environment there and that has i designed.

168
00:13:34,82 --> 00:13:38,03
I did all the convincing when i
purchased the land. I did that myself.

169
00:13:40,35 --> 00:13:43,31
I designed it. I did the plans.

170
00:13:44,42 --> 00:13:48,95
I had the services of a builder
to do a lot of the work.

171
00:13:49,23 --> 00:13:52,63
And every morning before i went
to work in the public service.

172
00:13:52,70 --> 00:13:56,26
I used to get up six o'clock and
work on the house for two hours

173
00:13:57,16 --> 00:14:02,48
and then go to work and then come home in
the evenings and work on it. Again. So.

174
00:14:03,50 --> 00:14:05,33
Yeah i've built.

175
00:14:05,35 --> 00:14:09,87
I've built a lot of that house too and
other people came and helped as well

176
00:14:09,87 --> 00:14:12,92
and we had working b
and and it was lovely.

177
00:14:14,20 --> 00:14:17,62
Your work.

178
00:14:17,64 --> 00:14:24,05
I guess.

179
00:14:25,88 --> 00:14:32,29
The challenges for the area is to find
creative responses to the unemployment

180
00:14:32,29 --> 00:14:33,62
program problem.

181
00:14:36,38 --> 00:14:42,81
The challenge is to not be
overwhelmed by despair.

182
00:14:43,75 --> 00:14:50,49
The challenge is to maintain heart
for me is to maintain heart

183
00:14:51,18 --> 00:14:56,12
in a bureaucracy which
is fairly heartless.

184
00:14:56,83 --> 00:15:02,41
So we have very very
high unemployment here

185
00:15:03,38 --> 00:15:04,92
and.

186
00:15:04,93 --> 00:15:09,79
I see that as a possibility
with creative responses to

187
00:15:09,79 --> 00:15:14,20
that situation to again keep
the spirit of aquarius going

188
00:15:14,20 --> 00:15:16,64
and finding new ways of doing things and.

189
00:15:18,37 --> 00:15:22,42
And the department is is is responding.

190
00:15:22,44 --> 00:15:28,09
I've been involved in the training and
employment of people in the birthing

191
00:15:28,79 --> 00:15:31,71
and yogurt yoga training.

192
00:15:31,73 --> 00:15:36,79
In permaculture in organic farming.

193
00:15:36,81 --> 00:15:40,15
There are people making training

194
00:15:40,15 --> 00:15:45,69
and setting up an incubator
business in recycled and.

195
00:15:46,46 --> 00:15:51,04
Found timbers to make furniture.

196
00:15:52,23 --> 00:15:56,22
Hopefully enterprises like.

197
00:15:57,10 --> 00:16:00,60
The rainbow power company will
will grow in a. Other areas too.

198
00:16:02,08 --> 00:16:08,50
So yeah it's it's also being

199
00:16:08,50 --> 00:16:11,55
being.

200
00:16:12,81 --> 00:16:16,79
A sort of a medium a mediator
between the bureaucracies.

201
00:16:17,46 --> 00:16:23,07
Which are struggling to come to terms with
the ideas of the alternative lifestyle

202
00:16:23,07 --> 00:16:25,87
and they and other
people in this area too.

203
00:16:26,01 --> 00:16:29,60
And therefore and their
unemployment problem. Situation.

204
00:16:29,78 --> 00:16:38,10
Maybe unemployment can be turned
into something other than a problem.

205
00:16:39,61 --> 00:16:43,08
For you.

206
00:16:43,10 --> 00:16:46,63
I'm i'm struggling against the
use of the at the word hope.

207
00:16:47,33 --> 00:16:52,90
Because it kind of smacks of no hope.

208
00:16:52,92 --> 00:16:59,66
So my my vision my my
optimism for nimbin is

209
00:16:59,66 --> 00:17:06,58
that it will learn go on learning from its

210
00:17:06,59 --> 00:17:09,44
export are experience.

211
00:17:10,93 --> 00:17:17,32
That the nimbin is not seen as just being
them thin but is more than the name

212
00:17:17,32 --> 00:17:21,18
and so there's an indian village
in the nimbin community

213
00:17:21,18 --> 00:17:23,44
and then aquarius goes beyond that.

214
00:17:25,66 --> 00:17:29,56
That the children that have
grown up in and around nimbin.

215
00:17:29,58 --> 00:17:33,62
Will be able to hold in their hearts

216
00:17:34,90 --> 00:17:39,40
and they will they they
will they will always have

217
00:17:39,40 --> 00:17:46,29
that even if they they set it aside for
a time they were always having the

218
00:17:46,29 --> 00:17:49,31
nimbin experienced an embittered
growing in their hearts

219
00:17:49,31 --> 00:17:52,95
and they will always be very special
and very different as a result of it.

220
00:17:54,52 --> 00:18:00,94
So that that nimbin will will grow.
That nimbin will be able to. To. Two.

221
00:18:03,70 --> 00:18:09,16
Move into the 21st century with
the best of what we've learned

222
00:18:10,01 --> 00:18:13,56
and to deal in.

223
00:18:15,58 --> 00:18:18,65
A compassionate and heart
filled way with the problems

224
00:18:19,41 --> 00:18:22,51
and to acknowledge its shadow side.

225
00:18:22,53 --> 00:18:27,93
But to to grow. My pleasure.

226
00:18:30,80 --> 00:18:33,38
When i saw people.
