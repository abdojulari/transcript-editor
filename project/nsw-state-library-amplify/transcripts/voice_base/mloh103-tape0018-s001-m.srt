1
00:00:16,06 --> 00:00:22,11
Yes. There's it.

2
00:00:22,13 --> 00:00:29,00
Is. Called a chick.

3
00:00:29,02 --> 00:00:36,01
K.o. The icy icy.

4
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:41,65
I guess i came up here and i was
about. Oh my name's martin.

5
00:00:41,67 --> 00:00:45,72
I've been out of high
school for two years.

6
00:00:46,89 --> 00:00:50,01
I'm writing planning on going
back to university next year.

7
00:00:51,83 --> 00:00:57,00
I came to him when i was about nine so
that means how long is that i'm 19 20 now.

8
00:00:57,19 --> 00:01:02,34
So that's more than 10 years.
I've been up in this area.

9
00:01:03,62 --> 00:01:08,51
I spent probably most of my school years
living in the area if not traveling to

10
00:01:08,51 --> 00:01:12,71
lismore to go to high school i spent the
last three years of primary school here.

11
00:01:12,73 --> 00:01:21,14
And i've sort of seen i've had things to
do with both sides of of nimbin town.

12
00:01:21,16 --> 00:01:25,07
Well there's there's always
been a sort of division or.

13
00:01:25,09 --> 00:01:29,10
A pretty recognizable rift
between between the original

14
00:01:29,10 --> 00:01:34,23
or the the old timers you know the
rednecks the settlers. Their families.

15
00:01:34,26 --> 00:01:38,89
What have you and the alternative
community which came in after 73.

16
00:01:38,91 --> 00:01:43,89
And even though they're sort of pretty
much reconciled now i've noticed that

17
00:01:43,89 --> 00:01:46,61
that division has always been there
and i think it always will be there.

18
00:01:47,48 --> 00:01:50,55
You know and i've seen it not
only in nimbin but but anywhere.

19
00:01:50,69 --> 00:01:51,13
You know where

20
00:01:51,13 --> 00:01:54,01
that where that's how the alternative
sort of our prizing is happened.

21
00:01:54,18 --> 00:01:57,67
It's sort of a it's a big
influential thing on the society

22
00:01:57,67 --> 00:01:59,88
but it's not actually
assimilated into it all that.

23
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,88
Much you know there's a bit of bit
of resentment and stuff behind it.

24
00:02:07,20 --> 00:02:12,83
Right like. Probably a really
vivid memory that i always have.

25
00:02:14,56 --> 00:02:15,62
Was in coming into nimbin

26
00:02:15,62 --> 00:02:19,61
when i was nine years old for the
first time with my aunty and mother

27
00:02:19,62 --> 00:02:23,60
and cousins and people. And it
was a hot summer day really hot

28
00:02:23,60 --> 00:02:25,51
and you know dragonflies
a buzzing around and

29
00:02:25,51 --> 00:02:30,28
and the main thing i could sense was
the smells you know it always has a

30
00:02:30,28 --> 00:02:32,25
distinctive smell which
is really different.

31
00:02:32,56 --> 00:02:38,59
It was a mixture of poor paws and and
grass and sort of you know animals

32
00:02:38,59 --> 00:02:43,26
and sweat and and you know warm
fetid human smells you know

33
00:02:44,03 --> 00:02:46,36
and we just opened up this
big pool pour on this

34
00:02:46,36 --> 00:02:49,24
and this watermelon on
this table and i rt it

35
00:02:49,24 --> 00:02:53,15
and insist the sort of as
my first memory of nimbin.

36
00:02:53,83 --> 00:02:58,47
Was from that time and. Other than that.

37
00:02:58,59 --> 00:03:02,08
I've just got a sort of continuing
memory from when i was younger.

38
00:03:03,08 --> 00:03:08,22
Of summers up in ixtlan which is
sort of just blood and even rocks.

39
00:03:08,24 --> 00:03:14,58
You know the images of summer streams and
the cow shit and the mud and insects

40
00:03:14,58 --> 00:03:16,70
and incense and things like that.

41
00:03:18,48 --> 00:03:21,78
And sort of i think that belongs to
childhood and i don't recap recapture

42
00:03:21,78 --> 00:03:25,84
that anymore. Too much has happened
since to be able to sort of a tree

43
00:03:25,84 --> 00:03:32,30
that type of ideally. Ideally
feeling but it was there.

44
00:03:36,73 --> 00:03:39,41
Well i never consciously realise

45
00:03:39,41 --> 00:03:42,17
that my parents were different
from anyone else's parents.

46
00:03:42,46 --> 00:03:45,86
And it was only i only learnt
externally from other people

47
00:03:45,86 --> 00:03:50,43
and from other people's sort of
disparagement and which meant that

48
00:03:50,43 --> 00:03:53,93
when i go to primary school for example
in you for i was only about nine.

49
00:03:54,57 --> 00:03:58,32
You know i'm wearing the full meat
for will jump. Nothing underneath.

50
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,08
You know big pair of baggy cotton pants

51
00:04:02,08 --> 00:04:06,19
and no underpants no underwear
no shoes long hair feathers

52
00:04:07,42 --> 00:04:09,17
and kids saying you know.

53
00:04:09,19 --> 00:04:12,31
You know really being ostracized
in a school which is really bad

54
00:04:12,31 --> 00:04:16,63
and kids saying oh you know do you ever
wish you had you brush your teeth you know

55
00:04:16,63 --> 00:04:19,73
if you got a disease. You know what
language do you speak type thing

56
00:04:20,89 --> 00:04:22,92
and it was pretty bad for
a while but i don't.

57
00:04:23,03 --> 00:04:27,22
How do i think actually what happened
to our generation my generation is

58
00:04:27,23 --> 00:04:31,97
that after. After going
through that original.

59
00:04:32,76 --> 00:04:37,03
Rejection time by by other peers we actually
became much more conservative than our

60
00:04:37,03 --> 00:04:38,68
parents were which means

61
00:04:38,68 --> 00:04:44,29
that now we're sort of integrating back
into sort of mainstream australian middle

62
00:04:44,29 --> 00:04:47,77
class technological society.
There's a bit of it.

63
00:04:47,88 --> 00:04:53,93
There's a bit of a backlash actually.
You know which is pretty pretty big.

64
00:04:53,95 --> 00:04:56,88
You know i don't go to the commerce school

65
00:04:56,88 --> 00:05:01,85
but my mum taught there for a while like a
lot of friends from there i started off

66
00:05:01,85 --> 00:05:06,44
in the central school which was always a
stronghold of you know dairy farmers sons

67
00:05:06,44 --> 00:05:08,05
and daughters.

68
00:05:14,16 --> 00:05:21,15
Oh. Not once or twice
playground sites. Prejudice.

69
00:05:22,72 --> 00:05:28,14
Just general small minded. You
know typically australian.

70
00:05:28,16 --> 00:05:31,46
Narrow minded thing but the thing about
it was it was never too serious.

71
00:05:32,40 --> 00:05:35,74
You know nothing nothing
too bad ever happened.

72
00:05:35,76 --> 00:05:38,11
It was just always those with the hippies

73
00:05:38,11 --> 00:05:41,05
and those with the good guys you
know the cricket players and stuff.

74
00:05:41,10 --> 00:05:45,25
You're either a cricket player you're
a hippy and hippy didn't play bowls

75
00:05:45,25 --> 00:05:51,21
or cricket or you know something they went
around sort of reading herman hesse or.

76
00:05:51,22 --> 00:05:55,31
Burning incense or you know talking
about shoes christian or something

77
00:05:56,15 --> 00:05:59,92
that you know that's sort of young
kids sort of picking up some.

78
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,14
Those and images themselves i suppose.

79
00:06:07,50 --> 00:06:12,39
Ok. Well we were just always into.

80
00:06:14,20 --> 00:06:17,91
We're into each other which is
something i think a lot of other kids

81
00:06:17,91 --> 00:06:21,93
when we're integers discovering each
other in a sort of pretty personal way.

82
00:06:23,46 --> 00:06:27,73
I just remember. You know
sort of hooking from school

83
00:06:27,73 --> 00:06:29,88
and going down to the river and
swimming and stuff like that.

84
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:35,14
You know naked and smoking cigarettes and
later on smoking marijuana and girls

85
00:06:35,15 --> 00:06:36,50
and parties

86
00:06:36,50 --> 00:06:41,65
and sort of it was it was a way of life
which we picked up from our parents because

87
00:06:41,65 --> 00:06:46,41
i suppose we you know we imitate our
parents more than anyone else and and

88
00:06:46,41 --> 00:06:50,26
that was just not you know there was only
a group of about six us or something

89
00:06:50,26 --> 00:06:50,68
that did that.

90
00:06:51,86 --> 00:06:57,60
And everyone else was pretty much into
i don't know something barbie dolls

91
00:06:57,60 --> 00:07:00,10
or something. Something else.

92
00:07:08,84 --> 00:07:13,41
Yeah i do i have i have like i actually
when i first came up to an imminent.

93
00:07:13,62 --> 00:07:19,80
I lived in paradise valley for about about
three months before my mum came up from

94
00:07:19,80 --> 00:07:22,68
sydney schuster working
at a school down there.

95
00:07:22,70 --> 00:07:26,74
And i was living with this group of
adults of whom my stepfather was one and.

96
00:07:27,41 --> 00:07:31,86
I really remember their openness
and their sort of generosity

97
00:07:31,86 --> 00:07:35,74
and their sort of feel as ms.
you know that it all sit around

98
00:07:35,74 --> 00:07:42,54
and just i suppose it was a typical middle
class type of adult gathering insofar as

99
00:07:42,54 --> 00:07:44,26
that they were all educated
they'd been to uni.

100
00:07:44,72 --> 00:07:49,61
Psychologists lecturers
teachers doctors and they

101
00:07:50,40 --> 00:07:54,07
but they they had a sense of togetherness
which i really hadn't seen before in the

102
00:07:54,07 --> 00:07:59,50
city you know. I've been brought up going
to various schools in the city you know.

103
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,47
My parents were sort of. Divorced when i
was quite young and a lot type thing.

104
00:08:04,48 --> 00:08:07,56
I was always used to.
Displacement or disembodiment

105
00:08:07,56 --> 00:08:12,10
or something which was which
was alienating or broken apart

106
00:08:13,34 --> 00:08:14,80
and like you know

107
00:08:14,80 --> 00:08:18,91
when i first came to him in the first
thing i saw amongst the adults of this.

108
00:08:18,92 --> 00:08:22,56
Cohesion and.

109
00:08:22,58 --> 00:08:26,85
Just a seriousness of purpose as well you
know an integrity about what they were

110
00:08:26,85 --> 00:08:28,01
doing.

111
00:08:28,03 --> 00:08:32,28
And and they you know they had a lot of fun
too you know i mean it wasn't serious.

112
00:08:32,28 --> 00:08:36,88
There's nothing too serious about there was
no big big you know buddy roster system

113
00:08:36,88 --> 00:08:39,53
or big hippie commune set
i mean they were just.

114
00:08:39,54 --> 00:08:43,54
Intelligent people deciding to have a lot
of fun in their lives you know after

115
00:08:43,54 --> 00:08:50,02
going through the rat race for years and
years and i suppose that me my friends

116
00:08:50,02 --> 00:08:53,19
or picked up on that and we we still are.

117
00:09:01,54 --> 00:09:08,06
Well. We've sort of. We've all moved on
our own individual ways really like.

118
00:09:10,73 --> 00:09:15,05
A lot of my very close friends from paving
from the early days have gone on to uni

119
00:09:15,05 --> 00:09:20,30
like one of them has just graduated with
honors in europe biology at a new he's

120
00:09:20,30 --> 00:09:23,34
often england at the moment looking at unis
over there which is pretty impressive.

121
00:09:23,76 --> 00:09:28,26
You know my sister is down sydney
finishing off an economics degree

122
00:09:28,26 --> 00:09:28,98
and other things

123
00:09:28,98 --> 00:09:34,25
and others of us are still up here like
myself like luke who plays music i play

124
00:09:34,25 --> 00:09:37,29
music we we do things i write as well

125
00:09:38,49 --> 00:09:40,77
and that's all right we
sort of i think really

126
00:09:40,77 --> 00:09:43,87
that nimbin didn't have
such an impact on us

127
00:09:43,87 --> 00:09:50,37
that we were going to fall into one of its
types of categories whether it was get

128
00:09:50,38 --> 00:09:54,07
too far into drugs that we became junkies
or become full on hippies or whatever.

129
00:09:54,19 --> 00:09:57,75
We're going to do we followed our own
paths. You know which were all different.

130
00:09:58,76 --> 00:09:59,86
Some of us haven't been back if.

131
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:07,99
Years.

132
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:12,54
I'm definitely. Absolutely. Well.

133
00:10:13,62 --> 00:10:20,32
The people who who i knew as
a kid who i now know to be

134
00:10:20,32 --> 00:10:24,09
you know full on addicts.

135
00:10:24,92 --> 00:10:30,74
Quite seriously ruined by drugs by
hard drugs were always a bit a bit

136
00:10:30,74 --> 00:10:34,24
self-destructive anyway and whether
they're in yemen or wherever they were

137
00:10:34,24 --> 00:10:37,87
or where they were in the streets of
chippendale surry hills or brunswick street

138
00:10:37,87 --> 00:10:41,01
or wherever they were. Those are the types
of people who are going to get into

139
00:10:41,01 --> 00:10:44,00
that. Anyway so i don't think
there's always an argument

140
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:49,44
that nimbin produces the circumstances
for people to become junkies but i think

141
00:10:49,44 --> 00:10:52,46
that that that that's i
don't person's choice.

142
00:10:52,48 --> 00:10:58,62
So i mean i i remember a girl
who who was really amazing.

143
00:10:58,70 --> 00:11:00,66
And she she taught me how to ride a horse.

144
00:11:01,81 --> 00:11:05,54
I knew for years like for seven years
or something and last year i learned

145
00:11:05,54 --> 00:11:09,29
that she died of an idea in brisbane
and that that really threw me a lot

146
00:11:11,43 --> 00:11:13,05
and she didn't have any friends.

147
00:11:15,13 --> 00:11:17,23
She just couldn't handle it so she died

148
00:11:19,07 --> 00:11:22,41
and you know there's quite a
few stories like that around.

149
00:11:24,02 --> 00:11:26,42
But then again they're
people who have sort of.

150
00:11:26,43 --> 00:11:28,69
Not seen or heard of quite a few years now

151
00:11:28,69 --> 00:11:30,27
and they disappeared into the woodwork

152
00:11:31,33 --> 00:11:35,14
and there's no there's no thing about
nimbin there's no real support system for

153
00:11:35,14 --> 00:11:37,03
people who have got into
that type of thing.

154
00:11:38,18 --> 00:11:42,03
I don't know whether that that
should be a social concern

155
00:11:42,03 --> 00:11:44,71
or a hospital concern i was sort of.

156
00:11:45,56 --> 00:11:49,40
Parents concerned but for all the kids who
are out there on their own and homeless.

157
00:11:50,65 --> 00:11:52,33
There's no real support system for them.

158
00:11:53,73 --> 00:11:56,64
And that's pretty sad and
you know it's pretty bad.

159
00:12:05,68 --> 00:12:07,88
Some.

160
00:12:07,90 --> 00:12:14,58
Marijuana fitted into into the
usual young semi rebellious semi

161
00:12:14,58 --> 00:12:19,25
celebration resort of thing about
you know just being out there

162
00:12:19,25 --> 00:12:23,83
and getting away from your parents without
hippies or bureaucrats or businessman

163
00:12:23,83 --> 00:12:26,49
or whatever they were getting away
from them getting away from school.

164
00:12:27,59 --> 00:12:29,79
Getting away from your own
ambitions whatever it is

165
00:12:29,79 --> 00:12:33,55
and having a good time with your friends
and it was never a serious thing for me.

166
00:12:33,64 --> 00:12:38,06
I mean i haven't smoked for a long time
and lot of my friends haven't either.

167
00:12:38,18 --> 00:12:43,42
They've so left that you go left alone
when they finish high school and.

168
00:12:44,60 --> 00:12:46,99
It does change it does sort of.

169
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:52,95
Affect affect your development in certain
ways it opens you up to different

170
00:12:52,95 --> 00:12:55,23
different thoughts and different
ways of looking at things

171
00:12:55,23 --> 00:13:00,44
but then again it's like any drug it's
recreational as. If you have too much of it.

172
00:13:00,47 --> 00:13:07,16
It's not good for you. You know so
marijuana is the thing about my one of

173
00:13:07,16 --> 00:13:12,64
that was it. Lots of people going
to dealing which is pretty.

174
00:13:12,65 --> 00:13:15,54
I don't know i was i was sort
of was critical of that.

175
00:13:16,71 --> 00:13:17,63
Because i thought there was a better.

176
00:13:17,66 --> 00:13:19,84
You know better things to do
than get into dealing marijuana

177
00:13:19,84 --> 00:13:22,78
and they're still doing it and i
think that's a destructive force

178
00:13:22,78 --> 00:13:27,00
and my own peers and i my
own sort of generation.

179
00:13:27,02 --> 00:13:29,37
But you know again that's their choice.

180
00:13:29,39 --> 00:13:33,18
And i sort of i can't i find it hard to
be able to justify a lot of people's

181
00:13:33,18 --> 00:13:37,50
reasons for doing things and i can only
put it down to being their choice.

182
00:13:37,65 --> 00:13:39,37
So marijuana is something that.

183
00:13:40,05 --> 00:13:43,04
That all of us experience that
people do experience everywhere.

184
00:13:43,18 --> 00:13:46,72
Wherever they are and it's great
it's a great thing. It's like.

185
00:13:47,30 --> 00:13:51,46
It's like anything it's like
joys of life you know. And.

186
00:13:52,87 --> 00:13:59,50
It's just it's just a matter of
abuse and acceptance. I suppose.

187
00:14:07,52 --> 00:14:09,38
Yes absolutely absolutely.

188
00:14:10,82 --> 00:14:15,60
When i remember that when i was 10 i was
fully into drama and i don't know why

189
00:14:16,45 --> 00:14:21,05
but drama was it and i remember just reading
shakespeare and reading a lot because.

190
00:14:21,07 --> 00:14:24,78
And what we decided there was the start of
a new nimbin drama troupe you know just

191
00:14:24,78 --> 00:14:27,97
of young kids primary
school age kids. And.

192
00:14:29,40 --> 00:14:32,95
I remember we put on about two productions
of various things like arthur miller

193
00:14:32,95 --> 00:14:35,32
and. People like that.

194
00:14:36,43 --> 00:14:42,24
And i remember writing two plays really
funny little sort of plays about i don't

195
00:14:42,24 --> 00:14:45,78
know just about us. I suppose. And
we actually put the mining town.

196
00:14:45,81 --> 00:14:50,40
You know audiences came and it was
drinks and wine and cheese and music

197
00:14:50,41 --> 00:14:52,66
and it was really good and that happened.

198
00:14:52,78 --> 00:14:55,76
You know probably when i was 11
and 12 which is a young time

199
00:14:55,76 --> 00:14:59,87
that happened there was also classical music
society which i played out every week

200
00:14:59,87 --> 00:15:03,23
which was really good for
furthering you know mine

201
00:15:03,24 --> 00:15:06,85
and everyone else's musical
sort of skill or practice

202
00:15:06,85 --> 00:15:11,50
or whatever you know we used
to sort of have weekly.

203
00:15:11,51 --> 00:15:15,72
Gatherings at the town hall and about
eight o'clock on sunday nights.

204
00:15:15,74 --> 00:15:17,21
And just play music for hours.

205
00:15:17,33 --> 00:15:21,38
People see running cushions and i'd
get up and play some clarinet sonata

206
00:15:21,38 --> 00:15:25,56
and my sister play the cello and mother
play the piano and it was really good.

207
00:15:25,67 --> 00:15:29,20
It was always very informal i mean
i'm sure squeaking the whole time.

208
00:15:29,52 --> 00:15:32,11
You know that was acceptable.

209
00:15:32,13 --> 00:15:39,12
Yeah so definitely there was a
lot of a lot of help in us as

210
00:15:39,13 --> 00:15:42,36
far as getting us into our own thing was
concerned you know whether it was musical

211
00:15:43,28 --> 00:15:45,42
skateboarding or whatever the
hell it was you know it was

212
00:15:45,42 --> 00:15:49,63
or always alright to be doing those things
you know you didn't have to be going off

213
00:15:49,63 --> 00:15:54,06
and achieving what school you
didn't have to be. You know.

214
00:15:54,33 --> 00:15:57,76
Fulfilling the expectations of your
grandparents or or your parents

215
00:15:57,76 --> 00:15:59,73
or your teachers or whatever it was.

216
00:16:00,30 --> 00:16:05,72
It was always very much an individual
orientated thing i don't know whether it was

217
00:16:05,72 --> 00:16:07,12
more so than your else but.

218
00:16:07,78 --> 00:16:08,75
But it seemed

219
00:16:08,75 --> 00:16:24,79
that way.

220
00:16:28,04 --> 00:16:29,76
That's really true not
only is it a challenge.

221
00:16:30,12 --> 00:16:36,24
It's a yeah it's a.

222
00:16:36,26 --> 00:16:40,83
Being in nimbin and feeling the
need to break out of nimbin.

223
00:16:41,76 --> 00:16:44,72
And go to the city and achieve something
else is not only a challenge.

224
00:16:44,77 --> 00:16:51,15
It's also a very difficult thing to do
emotionally because once you've been up here.

225
00:16:51,44 --> 00:16:54,78
If you've been up here for as long as
i have which is more than 10 years.

226
00:16:54,80 --> 00:16:58,75
You become really attached to
what is basically a paradise

227
00:16:59,59 --> 00:17:03,46
and you begin to wonder well is there really
need to go to the city is there really

228
00:17:03,46 --> 00:17:06,31
need to get a degree is there
a need to achieve something

229
00:17:06,31 --> 00:17:11,09
and become a sort of working functioning
member of a sort of open society

230
00:17:12,10 --> 00:17:13,98
and you really think no there
isn't a need for that.

231
00:17:14,16 --> 00:17:17,63
But yes it's a challenge and
it's a it's a nice challenge

232
00:17:17,63 --> 00:17:22,73
but i think nimbin is a place we will all
come back to you know all the time we

233
00:17:22,73 --> 00:17:24,52
will be coming back i've
always come back here.

234
00:17:30,65 --> 00:17:36,58
Ferals. I think i don't remember.

235
00:17:36,81 --> 00:17:40,83
There always being cells actually i think
feral seems to be one of the latest

236
00:17:40,83 --> 00:17:45,24
phases of existential billion
whether whether it's.

237
00:17:45,96 --> 00:17:50,19
Comes from from punk from
skinheads and from whatever.

238
00:17:51,90 --> 00:17:53,13
I don't really.

239
00:17:55,40 --> 00:18:00,38
I just think that ferals it's important
for whoever decides to become that. Out.

240
00:18:00,49 --> 00:18:04,10
Lee contemptuous of everything learns
how to integrate at some point

241
00:18:04,81 --> 00:18:05,28
and the fact is

242
00:18:05,28 --> 00:18:09,33
that all of the fellows do live off the
government which isn't isn't a bad thing

243
00:18:09,33 --> 00:18:11,60
or anything but you know that's
how we work our society but.

244
00:18:12,25 --> 00:18:15,83
It would be nice if one day they they
learnt how to make furniture or something

245
00:18:15,83 --> 00:18:19,82
and they set up workshops and they
sold so naturally they sold handcrafts

246
00:18:19,82 --> 00:18:21,38
or goods or clothes or something like

247
00:18:21,38 --> 00:18:25,25
that because at the moment they're
really quite a bit abusive

248
00:18:25,25 --> 00:18:30,19
and they're a bit exploitative
of their environment.

249
00:18:31,36 --> 00:18:34,32
Not i don't know. I've
never really had any.

250
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:40,28
Any interaction with fell apart
from meeting them in it in a creek

251
00:18:40,28 --> 00:18:41,91
or getting stoned with them or something.

252
00:18:43,07 --> 00:18:45,84
I think they're just fun loving people
who just want to have a good time

253
00:18:45,84 --> 00:18:47,93
but it's a juvenile type of thing.

254
00:18:48,64 --> 00:18:50,94
It's an important thing but it's
juvenile and i think it's something

255
00:18:50,94 --> 00:18:58,83
that had to go out of eventually.

256
00:19:00,35 --> 00:19:00,51
Well.

257
00:19:02,27 --> 00:19:07,98
They've always seemed to sort of revolve
around around what's happening drug wise.

258
00:19:08,26 --> 00:19:09,70
I think that's sounds
like a general statement

259
00:19:09,70 --> 00:19:15,80
but that's first it was always just a peace
loving hippie you know stereotypical

260
00:19:15,80 --> 00:19:20,23
60s american images of the hippie who who
really just wanted to live peacefully on

261
00:19:20,23 --> 00:19:26,90
a communist might be or join. Smack
came in cocaine in all this stuff.

262
00:19:27,01 --> 00:19:30,85
You know designer drugs are in
there now and people are changing.

263
00:19:31,25 --> 00:19:36,30
You know you get sort of yuppie middle
class suburbanites from brisbane

264
00:19:36,30 --> 00:19:37,40
or sydney coming up

265
00:19:37,40 --> 00:19:42,35
and down to to buy their drugs they're
setting up little businesses and

266
00:19:43,48 --> 00:19:48,01
and what have you so newman's lost its
original idealistic sort of cohesion

267
00:19:48,01 --> 00:19:53,69
and it's become a bit disparate and
a bit sort of a bit scattered in

268
00:19:53,69 --> 00:19:57,40
that way you know. The drug
culture has has given it.

269
00:19:57,56 --> 00:19:59,92
Such a commercial centre as far.

270
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,45
As business is concerned that there's
no real social conscience anymore

271
00:20:04,53 --> 00:20:07,63
and that's sad because you can see it in
the street you can see it in the people

272
00:20:07,63 --> 00:20:12,25
but at the same time it's
becoming much more ordinary.

273
00:20:12,27 --> 00:20:16,31
And it's it's turning into a pretty peaceful
middle class hamlet at the same time

274
00:20:16,31 --> 00:20:18,02
where whereby you've got.

275
00:20:18,48 --> 00:20:20,37
Families who aren't into drugs at all

276
00:20:20,37 --> 00:20:22,91
or aren't into anything
to alternative coming up.

277
00:20:24,77 --> 00:20:27,17
Having kids living and actually
living really peaceful

278
00:20:27,17 --> 00:20:32,51
and you know ecologically sound
and happy lives out in the hills.

279
00:20:32,65 --> 00:20:35,12
You know what i suppose they
are environmentally conscious

280
00:20:36,28 --> 00:20:38,93
but it's not it's not a self-conscious
thing like it was in the early days

281
00:20:40,06 --> 00:20:41,77
and that's really good and
i think the more of that

282
00:20:41,77 --> 00:20:44,38
that happens everywhere around australia
the better because it needn't be.

283
00:20:44,64 --> 00:20:47,61
It needn't be sudden or revolutionary or

284
00:20:48,40 --> 00:20:52,73
or aggressive towards the old
settlers there like it wasn't 73.

285
00:20:52,97 --> 00:20:56,24
But it can be integrated
into the mainstream society.

286
00:20:56,25 --> 00:20:58,30
You know which simply just means
learning how to live with.

287
00:20:59,13 --> 00:21:01,30
With an awareness about what
you're doing with your rubbish.

288
00:21:01,61 --> 00:21:04,88
You know where you're putting a plastic
where you're putting your bottles where

289
00:21:04,88 --> 00:21:06,33
you're putting your shit.

290
00:21:06,35 --> 00:21:11,47
You know working out how you can use you
use your own land for the most most

291
00:21:11,48 --> 00:21:12,35
convenient purposes

292
00:21:12,35 --> 00:21:14,86
and efficient purposes without
destroying what you've got which is what

293
00:21:14,86 --> 00:21:17,19
permaculture is all about
and that started off here

294
00:21:18,21 --> 00:21:22,89
and learning about the social
the social sort of relevance of

295
00:21:22,89 --> 00:21:25,80
that as far as your kids are concerned
and what school to send them to

296
00:21:25,80 --> 00:21:28,08
or things like that. You know.

297
00:21:28,10 --> 00:21:33,74
And that's that's where nimbin has its
strengths now it doesn't have it in the old.

298
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:36,76
Nostalgic your earnings
of doped up people.

299
00:21:36,79 --> 00:21:40,81
It's got it in the hard working
conscious and yet mainstream.

300
00:21:41,47 --> 00:21:45,58
Middle class trend that's been happening
in the last five years and other than

301
00:21:45,58 --> 00:21:48,96
that other than the sort of other
than the yuppie drug scene and

302
00:21:48,96 --> 00:21:52,21
and the middle class family
saying shall i put it.

303
00:21:53,15 --> 00:21:56,41
I can't really think of there
being any other major strand.

304
00:21:56,50 --> 00:21:59,95
There's always the
rebellious clique from syd.

305
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,26
Here from newtown from glee who decide
to come up and check on him by now.

306
00:22:04,21 --> 00:22:07,16
But it's usually a bit too slow and they
end up going back back home to sydney

307
00:22:07,16 --> 00:22:08,39
or there's.

308
00:22:09,69 --> 00:22:12,62
Others there's a bit of an aboriginal
community developing as well which is good

309
00:22:13,37 --> 00:22:17,16
because i always i always
noticed conspicuously

310
00:22:17,16 --> 00:22:20,30
that there weren't many aboriginals
in the ambon and now there are more

311
00:22:20,30 --> 00:22:23,53
and they're actually getting land for
example there's a there's quite a large

312
00:22:23,53 --> 00:22:26,01
community at the base of nimbin rocks.

313
00:22:26,03 --> 00:22:29,51
Who have reclaimed their land and it's
their land and they all live there

314
00:22:29,51 --> 00:22:31,24
and it's really good and
that they're quite happy in.

315
00:22:31,87 --> 00:22:34,67
And everyone interacts with them and they
inject with us and it's really good.

316
00:22:35,30 --> 00:22:38,66
So it's you know it's pretty much all big
one family as far as they're concerned

317
00:22:38,66 --> 00:22:41,46
now which is good.

318
00:22:42,48 --> 00:22:42,77
Apart from

319
00:22:42,77 --> 00:22:59,49
that i can't think of any other subcultural
trend that's taking place in the.

320
00:23:00,53 --> 00:23:04,81
Well it's. There are a few there are
a few of us who decided to do that

321
00:23:04,81 --> 00:23:10,66
but it's much less self-consciously alternative
than what our parents were what the

322
00:23:10,66 --> 00:23:15,88
basically people who who want to settle
down. Have families if they can live.

323
00:23:16,04 --> 00:23:17,98
You know live in their own
house. If they can afford that.

324
00:23:18,98 --> 00:23:23,43
But they're also basically people who are
still training for some some sort of

325
00:23:23,43 --> 00:23:29,46
occupation you haven't got
any any real livelihood yet.

326
00:23:29,47 --> 00:23:31,75
And so they're not really
getting into permaculture

327
00:23:31,75 --> 00:23:37,38
and they're not really getting into into
hippiedom as such what they're getting

328
00:23:37,38 --> 00:23:39,54
into is just staying up here
rather than going to the city.

329
00:23:39,57 --> 00:23:41,86
So i don't know whether
that's a regressive step

330
00:23:41,86 --> 00:23:44,33
or what it is i don't think it's it
really matters to make a judgment on

331
00:23:44,33 --> 00:23:49,72
that level but. But they're they're much
more ordinary about things you know.

332
00:23:49,74 --> 00:23:50,84
And most of them on the dole.

333
00:23:50,98 --> 00:23:53,84
You know i'll be getting the dollar
a couple of months or something.

334
00:23:54,85 --> 00:23:59,50
After i've waited for 13 weeks but.
Yeah it's sort of there's a lot of.

335
00:24:00,96 --> 00:24:04,51
There's a lot of pull towards
just stay instead of going.

336
00:24:04,53 --> 00:24:09,82
And i think it'll change i think over the
next few decades then will become so much

337
00:24:09,82 --> 00:24:12,72
more of an ordinary
place. You know i can't.

338
00:24:14,44 --> 00:24:20,36
It will become pretty much a country
town with. With different tendencies.

339
00:24:20,68 --> 00:24:20,85
You know

340
00:24:20,85 --> 00:24:36,33
and that's about it.

341
00:24:37,69 --> 00:24:40,96
Well i think it's a very
simple thing which is that

342
00:24:40,96 --> 00:24:47,53
when you've been exposed to such
a wide variety of different life

343
00:24:47,53 --> 00:24:50,35
lifestyle options.

344
00:24:50,36 --> 00:24:55,16
You know it comes as no surprise that
what you would naturally get is is a wide

345
00:24:55,16 --> 00:24:58,36
and open and accepting

346
00:24:58,36 --> 00:25:03,25
and tolerating view of the society as a
whole which i suppose on a personal level

347
00:25:03,25 --> 00:25:07,25
means that that haven't been brought
up in sydney as a young kid

348
00:25:07,25 --> 00:25:11,23
and sort of gone to private schools
until i was seven or six or whatever.

349
00:25:12,63 --> 00:25:16,15
You know it's a close type of life the
close lifestyle it's very much a middle

350
00:25:16,15 --> 00:25:21,10
class protected financially secure.

351
00:25:22,36 --> 00:25:24,38
Conservative type of way of of living.

352
00:25:24,50 --> 00:25:27,27
Coming up here just opened me
up to a completely different.

353
00:25:28,66 --> 00:25:33,23
Freedom which which unfortunately a lot
of people in this country haven't got the

354
00:25:33,23 --> 00:25:36,92
opportunity to experience you know.

355
00:25:36,93 --> 00:25:43,46
And so it's living growing up up here has
opened me to a whole different range of

356
00:25:43,46 --> 00:25:48,76
spiritual practices. And i mean you know.

357
00:25:49,06 --> 00:25:52,03
The simple fact that there's
there's a christian.

358
00:25:52,95 --> 00:25:56,11
Christian a sort of settlement in the
will and bar that there's so much.

359
00:25:57,27 --> 00:25:59,65
There's so much eastern
discipline which is.

360
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,08
Seriously followed up
here is is impressive.

361
00:26:03,25 --> 00:26:05,97
You know to a young person to young
person's impressionable mind.

362
00:26:06,62 --> 00:26:10,40
And that's something which i just know
wouldn't have been an issue in sydney

363
00:26:10,40 --> 00:26:12,84
and i can see it now because
i had friends in sydney.

364
00:26:12,85 --> 00:26:14,91
When i was a kid and and i still know them

365
00:26:14,91 --> 00:26:17,70
and we've grown up parallel although
they've grown up down there

366
00:26:17,70 --> 00:26:21,89
and i've grown up up here and they and
they're sort of into what they're doing

367
00:26:21,89 --> 00:26:25,95
but they're very commercially orientated
they're very consumer orientated they're

368
00:26:25,95 --> 00:26:30,58
much more into finding out what money
they can get hold of whatever they can.

369
00:26:30,76 --> 00:26:32,16
They're into urban types of.

370
00:26:32,72 --> 00:26:37,50
Types of hobbies you know
they while i was doing drama

371
00:26:37,51 --> 00:26:40,54
or something up here they were doing
skateboarding in the streets of manly

372
00:26:40,54 --> 00:26:43,87
or whatever you know while i was smoking
marijuana they were probably taking

373
00:26:43,87 --> 00:26:45,70
ecstasy or designer drugs you know stuff.

374
00:26:45,84 --> 00:26:48,33
It's just a different
type of slant on things.

375
00:26:49,68 --> 00:26:54,33
One is a bit more competitive
in rat race than the other.

376
00:26:54,35 --> 00:26:57,76
And each have their sort of negative
tendencies in their positive tendencies.

377
00:26:58,42 --> 00:27:01,96
But i think that the mere fact
that being up here for so long

378
00:27:01,96 --> 00:27:04,78
and experiencing the different
types of people i have up here.

379
00:27:05,52 --> 00:27:08,16
You know for as many years
i have means that. That.

380
00:27:08,66 --> 00:27:13,73
Me and young people like
myself have got quite a wide

381
00:27:14,77 --> 00:27:20,26
and accepting view. More educated
view more informed about.

382
00:27:20,28 --> 00:27:23,02
About australian society and

383
00:27:24,18 --> 00:27:28,10
and it's sort of subcultures
as a whole you know.

384
00:27:28,11 --> 00:27:32,15
It's a it's a general sort of
statement but i think i think.

385
00:27:32,17 --> 00:27:39,32
The wider view you have the more the more
informed you are about your society.

386
00:27:48,66 --> 00:27:53,43
Well. Well it is totally confusing the
thing about the spiritual sort of.

387
00:27:53,80 --> 00:27:56,20
Aether that is playing
around in these hills is

388
00:27:56,20 --> 00:27:59,41
that people become very
self-indulgent and they.

389
00:28:00,76 --> 00:28:05,25
They become quite self preoccupied which
is you know which i suppose is alright for

390
00:28:05,25 --> 00:28:06,67
an individual in some part of his life

391
00:28:06,67 --> 00:28:10,05
but in the end you've got to get down
to the real the real hard work you know

392
00:28:10,81 --> 00:28:12,22
digging the ship and

393
00:28:13,18 --> 00:28:17,98
and so you know what you probably see up
here is a lot of of quite precious people

394
00:28:17,98 --> 00:28:20,35
going around spouting forth
a little philosophies.

395
00:28:20,49 --> 00:28:22,46
But see that's you know
that's what it's all about.

396
00:28:22,58 --> 00:28:24,04
You've got to have somewhere
in the country that does

397
00:28:24,04 --> 00:28:28,19
that you know not everyone can be out
being business executives or something.

398
00:28:28,21 --> 00:28:31,55
You know noting their fast buck you know
someone's got to be delivering their

399
00:28:31,55 --> 00:28:35,63
philosophy. However half baked they may
be so that's what it's like up here

400
00:28:35,63 --> 00:28:40,05
and you know and it's good because.
In the end it is confusing.

401
00:28:40,36 --> 00:28:41,64
You're right you know it is confusing.

402
00:28:41,86 --> 00:28:44,16
There's a lot of stuff that's
going around and for it.

403
00:28:44,23 --> 00:28:46,81
You know especially before
you've developed your own.

404
00:28:47,23 --> 00:28:49,85
Your own firm beliefs about the world.

405
00:28:50,81 --> 00:28:53,25
It's hard to know which
are really where it's at

406
00:28:53,25 --> 00:28:56,93
or not you know a lot of them
are just real crap you know

407
00:28:56,93 --> 00:28:59,04
and a lot of them are
quite quite inspiring.

408
00:28:59,17 --> 00:29:05,09
So i mean there's a lot of
you've got you've got a cultists

409
00:29:05,09 --> 00:29:09,07
transcendentalists yogis set on you.

410
00:29:09,07 --> 00:29:14,26
Sadhus all those people out there doing
what they do and i suppose you witness it.

411
00:29:14,28 --> 00:29:18,53
And you observe a new appreciation
and you take your choice.

412
00:29:20,09 --> 00:29:24,59
Ah well yeah. Do i have one.

413
00:29:25,74 --> 00:29:29,85
Oh look i you know there's
so many stupid here.

414
00:29:29,91 --> 00:29:35,81
I think is i really can't can't choose i
now. Know i really can't think of one.

415
00:29:35,94 --> 00:29:37,89
I can't think of one.

416
00:29:42,12 --> 00:29:45,24
Funny nimbin story.

417
00:29:49,18 --> 00:29:52,29
I can't. It's hard to think
single one of my head.

418
00:30:06,01 --> 00:30:10,27
Well.

419
00:30:11,45 --> 00:30:17,91
For me for me the real the real beauty in
the real importance about living up here

420
00:30:17,91 --> 00:30:23,15
is been the natural the natural
abundance of the place which has meant

421
00:30:23,15 --> 00:30:27,25
that over the years i've i've really
learned how to add to live out there

422
00:30:27,25 --> 00:30:28,71
and you know which which included.

423
00:30:29,29 --> 00:30:36,00
Trips walking days across the nightcap
range ridge from from then been here

424
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:39,77
to the base of the mound in the
hills. You know which meant.

425
00:30:40,27 --> 00:30:42,55
Sort of getting on my
horse with some friends

426
00:30:42,55 --> 00:30:45,95
and for three days camping in writing from
here through the forest up to the base

427
00:30:45,95 --> 00:30:48,53
of the pinnacle over there which
you can see you know which.

428
00:30:49,19 --> 00:30:52,35
Which meant just being so inspired
by the landscape that i'd go out

429
00:30:52,35 --> 00:30:53,83
and buy a canvas and paints to try

430
00:30:53,83 --> 00:30:57,16
and paint what i could see
pretty poorly probably.

431
00:30:57,80 --> 00:31:02,70
But you know it's just such an
inspiring thing to be in you know.

432
00:31:03,46 --> 00:31:07,68
Having having the opportunity to go
down to hang on falls every week

433
00:31:07,68 --> 00:31:12,68
and swim down there in this amazing
natural water full well and all of

434
00:31:12,68 --> 00:31:18,53
that it's just it's amazing thing to be
able to do as a kid when you're going up

435
00:31:18,53 --> 00:31:22,20
and i really. I do pity a
lot of a lot of people who.

436
00:31:22,85 --> 00:31:26,16
Who just haven't known that part
that part about australia or

437
00:31:26,16 --> 00:31:27,71
that part about being out in the country.

438
00:31:28,39 --> 00:31:33,32
And sort of hippiedom and drug
culture and all of that is around.

439
00:31:33,34 --> 00:31:35,16
But for me it always lies.
