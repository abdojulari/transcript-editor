1
00:00:16,63 --> 00:00:18,55
Ok take idi.

2
00:00:18,57 --> 00:00:22,55
Tuesday you think they have them
in on in only two in lismore

3
00:00:22,56 --> 00:00:26,79
and speaking with barry.

4
00:00:27,75 --> 00:00:33,45
Back. My name is barry
barry and jerome barry.

5
00:00:33,70 --> 00:00:39,36
Been working out in nimbin for the
last three years in an informal manner

6
00:00:40,16 --> 00:00:45,10
and formally for the last four
months being arcs by the elders

7
00:00:45,10 --> 00:00:49,56
and endorsed by the elders to get
certain projects happening in their own

8
00:00:49,56 --> 00:00:56,04
and particular bunch along language and.

9
00:00:57,47 --> 00:01:03,92
Community activities within
them. But in the culture.

10
00:01:03,93 --> 00:01:08,44
They have if i just city.

11
00:01:09,42 --> 00:01:16,09
Were. One thing come from nimble that.

12
00:01:16,35 --> 00:01:21,83
Comes from my word nimble which is
the hairy people of the country.

13
00:01:22,16 --> 00:01:24,72
And prior to

14
00:01:24,72 --> 00:01:31,04
that anybody who was a area a grey haired

15
00:01:32,27 --> 00:01:37,99
woman. A very wise man was there.

16
00:01:39,15 --> 00:01:44,79
They come from what i hear people have
always been here in this country from time

17
00:01:44,79 --> 00:01:51,56
immemorial. And they were here
when the bagel first arrived.

18
00:01:51,65 --> 00:01:54,53
That's the dark skin people
were talking about bagel.

19
00:01:54,98 --> 00:01:59,85
And they landed at eventide there
was another landing also at the.

20
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:00,15
No

21
00:02:01,65 --> 00:02:08,17
but this particular one it evans
had the bagel landed there

22
00:02:09,75 --> 00:02:14,00
and then began the process of
settlement within this country

23
00:02:15,33 --> 00:02:19,45
and they came across the
nimbin people at blue knob.

24
00:02:20,80 --> 00:02:27,18
That ninian which was a holy place
and then when the jags call sacred.

25
00:02:29,29 --> 00:02:34,20
And a war then erupted between the nimbin.

26
00:02:34,57 --> 00:02:36,77
People and the bagel.

27
00:02:38,00 --> 00:02:43,01
And during that war the bagel people
were pushed back down to the coast.

28
00:02:43,80 --> 00:02:45,98
And tradition was then formed.

29
00:02:46,12 --> 00:02:53,11
Whereas the children of
the bagel who had certain

30
00:02:54,32 --> 00:03:00,47
leanings towards healing were
taken to nimbin. And were then.

31
00:03:00,68 --> 00:03:03,66
Shown the healing sciences

32
00:03:04,83 --> 00:03:07,81
and medicinal herbal usage

33
00:03:09,26 --> 00:03:10,53
and sacred law

34
00:03:11,80 --> 00:03:18,31
and they were then taken back down to their
people. The battle to instruct them.

35
00:03:18,58 --> 00:03:20,94
In the internal

36
00:03:22,18 --> 00:03:28,40
that was always a place of
spirituality and of healing.

37
00:03:29,49 --> 00:03:36,08
Yeah yeah. From them. It tells about
the. People what were they like.

38
00:03:37,98 --> 00:03:41,91
Oh very gentle people
they were vegetarian.

39
00:03:42,38 --> 00:03:46,18
People they had orange hair.

40
00:03:46,20 --> 00:03:49,65
And like i said they'd
been here for a long time.

41
00:03:51,04 --> 00:03:57,61
Their places underground
places their sacred places of

42
00:03:57,61 --> 00:03:59,86
crystals of.

43
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,61
Metals of healing places and power
places they were taught by the name

44
00:04:06,61 --> 00:04:10,28
but what was significance.

45
00:04:10,72 --> 00:04:17,50
In the role there was learnings

46
00:04:17,50 --> 00:04:20,43
within the rocks themselves on things

47
00:04:20,43 --> 00:04:22,04
that were to pass

48
00:04:25,24 --> 00:04:30,58
that i still say never because it's
sort of like a movie projector.

49
00:04:31,93 --> 00:04:33,58
I mean i can sit down and

50
00:04:33,58 --> 00:04:38,38
and look at global ghali which is
a big the big rock the first one

51
00:04:38,38 --> 00:04:41,42
that scene from lismore and.

52
00:04:42,91 --> 00:04:48,40
There's etchings there sculptures there's
oil paintings is photographs there's it's

53
00:04:48,40 --> 00:04:53,13
a lack of a movie you can sit there and
just watch a movie. If you say like.

54
00:04:53,81 --> 00:04:55,58
From sunup to sundown.

55
00:04:55,60 --> 00:05:00,20
And you can see faces
figures there are animals

56
00:05:00,20 --> 00:05:06,18
that are definitely european
and if i can see those things

57
00:05:06,18 --> 00:05:11,17
and i'm not the only one who have seen
things in the rock they're not a loose

58
00:05:11,17 --> 00:05:13,18
notions because they're
created by natural causes.

59
00:05:13,59 --> 00:05:19,26
By light and shade and by
texture. And so on and so on.

60
00:05:19,33 --> 00:05:21,35
So they're not loose nations. You know.

61
00:05:21,85 --> 00:05:27,35
And you know they're not under any
mushrooms or or anything like that.

62
00:05:28,45 --> 00:05:32,32
You know this seed with the weather
with a clear bright clear eyes.

63
00:05:32,63 --> 00:05:37,94
And if i could see those things
in the rock. I know for sure.

64
00:05:38,26 --> 00:05:42,63
And as a fact that the old people
also saw what was in those rocks

65
00:05:42,63 --> 00:05:46,53
and it was no surprise to them when the
european people came into the country

66
00:05:47,87 --> 00:05:52,75
but they recognized their
faces and their animals.

67
00:05:55,98 --> 00:05:59,69
So some people say that we.

68
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,91
When it's clay in the process.

69
00:06:04,93 --> 00:06:08,16
Can you tell us all while
nimbin for a start.

70
00:06:08,25 --> 00:06:11,02
Wasn't the place where people went
out there to settle full time.

71
00:06:11,26 --> 00:06:16,12
While none of the old people did anyway.
They were always in a state of movement.

72
00:06:17,79 --> 00:06:23,73
Moving around the country. You
know it was pretty boring.

73
00:06:24,25 --> 00:06:30,02
To stay in one place you know sort
of it wasn't buying a half acre.

74
00:06:31,52 --> 00:06:34,71
And having the pay off the
bank. Well if you lie for it.

75
00:06:34,80 --> 00:06:38,91
You know everyone was free to go and
move where they want to and the fact

76
00:06:38,91 --> 00:06:41,26
that nimbin was is that people went
out there for specific purposes

77
00:06:42,33 --> 00:06:46,76
and it may take two years it may take
three years for whatever purpose

78
00:06:46,76 --> 00:06:53,25
that was needed for them in their development
of exploration within themselves you

79
00:06:53,25 --> 00:06:56,85
know of human power or human abilities.

80
00:06:56,87 --> 00:06:59,27
Not so much power but you
mean abilities and knowledge

81
00:07:00,59 --> 00:07:01,53
and like i said they could happen.

82
00:07:02,04 --> 00:07:04,08
You know six months it
could happen in two years

83
00:07:04,08 --> 00:07:09,74
and three years could happen in four
years but you know then you moved on.

84
00:07:11,23 --> 00:07:15,69
There were other places to explore there
were other places to get knowledge from.

85
00:07:15,71 --> 00:07:19,42
And there were places out
there within the area where.

86
00:07:19,44 --> 00:07:25,71
Where the women didn't go and not
because that they were exempt from

87
00:07:25,71 --> 00:07:28,95
that place is because of
the ability of the women

88
00:07:28,95 --> 00:07:32,79
and their sensitivity to be
able to receive this knowledge

89
00:07:32,79 --> 00:07:36,54
and the power of these
places from a distance

90
00:07:37,70 --> 00:07:42,06
that there was no need for them to
go inside them or to go up to them.

91
00:07:44,11 --> 00:07:50,06
That was the men's business in that act
of penetration or of confrontation.

92
00:07:51,91 --> 00:07:56,09
The women had no need for that they
receive their full part and see

93
00:07:56,09 --> 00:08:00,19
and power from a distance because that's
their nature. That's their. That's it.

94
00:08:00,20 --> 00:08:06,15
Every so tells a bit about the children of

95
00:08:07,48 --> 00:08:10,85
the victim or the way. The bagel.

96
00:08:11,29 --> 00:08:14,96
The children of the baby or whether
with the way they were given the title.

97
00:08:15,39 --> 00:08:16,68
We and by the nimble.

98
00:08:18,90 --> 00:08:21,66
What with their role to heal

99
00:08:22,48 --> 00:08:27,33
and to teach a good law to the bagel.

100
00:08:28,35 --> 00:08:30,69
Which is the knowledge of
the earth that sacred law

101
00:08:32,15 --> 00:08:36,95
and the bagel knew the law they knew
the stars they came from the sea.

102
00:08:37,08 --> 00:08:42,69
They were quite familiar with
stars and with the sky dreams.

103
00:08:43,70 --> 00:08:47,02
But the sacred law in this
country is knowledge of the land

104
00:08:47,98 --> 00:08:54,57
that sacred also in the
cygnus country. Can you.

105
00:08:54,94 --> 00:08:59,71
Well it's certainly a country as a country
where you go to to get rid of your

106
00:08:59,71 --> 00:09:01,24
sickness.

107
00:09:01,26 --> 00:09:06,01
And that's anywhere in the country where
certain there is a designated sickness

108
00:09:06,01 --> 00:09:08,63
country that's not a place
where you go and get sick.

109
00:09:09,62 --> 00:09:12,68
It's a place where you take a sickness
to get rid of it because there are areas

110
00:09:12,68 --> 00:09:17,57
within that country that
have that power to take

111
00:09:17,57 --> 00:09:21,48
that sickness from you
anticipate it through.

112
00:09:21,61 --> 00:09:25,89
The land because at that you think.

113
00:09:27,23 --> 00:09:32,10
Through tracks people. Something
you have to heal yourself.

114
00:09:32,37 --> 00:09:34,34
Oh yeah there's a heavy
sicknesses out there

115
00:09:34,34 --> 00:09:38,51
and women at the moment you know
there's big. Drug abuse problems.

116
00:09:38,57 --> 00:09:41,04
I'm talking my drug abuse
on the tournament drugs.

117
00:09:41,94 --> 00:09:43,61
People are entitled to
use drugs if they wish.

118
00:09:45,92 --> 00:09:49,03
With proper knowledge but if you don't
have a proper knowledge of drugs

119
00:09:49,03 --> 00:09:53,40
when you just drug abuse and so there's
drug abuse going on at the moment.

120
00:09:53,56 --> 00:09:57,98
That's because of the draconian methods
of the government and the state laws

121
00:09:58,87 --> 00:10:00,95
that people. Getting sicker and sicker.

122
00:10:02,44 --> 00:10:07,63
Because of a social law does not because
of the law of the land the land is ailing

123
00:10:07,63 --> 00:10:12,86
all the time but if you have a
social situation where a plant.

124
00:10:14,53 --> 00:10:18,97
Naturally growing plant
from a seed is outlawed

125
00:10:20,64 --> 00:10:24,87
and made illegal and it's
the base of heroin trade

126
00:10:26,29 --> 00:10:31,02
and criminal activities within them
and the law has to be changed.

127
00:10:31,14 --> 00:10:32,34
That's a social law

128
00:10:32,34 --> 00:10:37,17
and it's killing the people the laws of
this land are killing the people of the

129
00:10:37,17 --> 00:10:41,56
land.

130
00:10:42,64 --> 00:10:47,10
Back to the way you know.

131
00:10:47,11 --> 00:10:56,46
The sickness.

132
00:10:56,48 --> 00:11:00,04
That that. You.

133
00:11:00,06 --> 00:11:06,45
So i've got what we have to i think what
we have to get dna to tim is the people's

134
00:11:06,45 --> 00:11:11,57
ability to look for a culture.

135
00:11:13,19 --> 00:11:17,98
People's ability to come in
contact and to learn a culture

136
00:11:18,80 --> 00:11:19,33
that has laws

137
00:11:21,54 --> 00:11:25,40
and this is a problem that's been
in this country for a long time is

138
00:11:25,41 --> 00:11:32,14
that there are people who have come from
european descent who find it very hard

139
00:11:33,05 --> 00:11:35,73
to come to terms with certain laws.

140
00:11:38,14 --> 00:11:42,36
Now there were say in nimbin for instance
there are people who are interested in

141
00:11:42,36 --> 00:11:43,93
bunge island. Culture.

142
00:11:44,16 --> 00:11:51,17
They're interested in finding out what
the old people did prior to invasion.

143
00:11:51,19 --> 00:11:52,06
The condition

144
00:11:52,06 --> 00:11:56,04
that was here in the country prior to
invasion was vastly different to the

145
00:11:56,04 --> 00:11:58,23
condition that has been in this
country for the last 200 years.

146
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:06,88
Now that's with so-called tribal
law the law in this country

147
00:12:06,88 --> 00:12:11,70
had to be strict.

148
00:12:13,97 --> 00:12:16,27
Any civilization that's under attack

149
00:12:17,71 --> 00:12:23,81
or invasion tighten up their
laws they introduce martial law.

150
00:12:25,03 --> 00:12:29,18
So this country has been in the sense under
a form of martial law for the last 200

151
00:12:29,18 --> 00:12:34,33
years and so some people take it as
being that this is aboriginal culture

152
00:12:34,33 --> 00:12:37,10
that these are the laws
of the aboriginal people.

153
00:12:37,99 --> 00:12:41,04
Yeah they are of course the laws of the
aboriginal people but they are the laws

154
00:12:41,04 --> 00:12:45,61
that weren't there not the laws that we
here 200 years ago prior to 200 years.

155
00:12:47,15 --> 00:12:51,01
They were different. There was
no need for a lot of the laws

156
00:12:51,01 --> 00:12:56,55
that are now within aboriginal
society or culture but even so

157
00:12:56,55 --> 00:13:01,50
that there are still people
who have no wish for. Laws.

158
00:13:04,13 --> 00:13:10,07
You know. Some women were told
of by the elders or by people

159
00:13:10,07 --> 00:13:13,57
that women aren't supposed
to go up to the rocks.

160
00:13:14,54 --> 00:13:20,32
What do you get you get groups
of women going up to the rocks.

161
00:13:22,49 --> 00:13:25,01
Or the elders say. You can't go there

162
00:13:26,95 --> 00:13:30,52
and what do you know before you
know it you've got picnic this

163
00:13:31,41 --> 00:13:36,38
and you've got people on my she's going to
those places because basically they were

164
00:13:36,38 --> 00:13:42,06
told not to go there. So this is a state
of lawlessness people have told the law

165
00:13:42,06 --> 00:13:43,42
and for very good reason.

166
00:13:44,88 --> 00:13:47,14
And so people deliberately go out
of the way to go and break the law.

167
00:13:48,43 --> 00:13:49,58
So if people are going
to have that attitude.

168
00:13:51,34 --> 00:13:56,15
There's a lot of the elders are
not happy with that attitude

169
00:13:57,26 --> 00:13:59,70
that if they tell people something about.

170
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:00,34
Culture

171
00:14:00,34 --> 00:14:05,54
and about the laws of the land because
it is a laws from the land the law comes

172
00:14:05,54 --> 00:14:09,02
from the land doesn't come from the
people is transmitted by the people.

173
00:14:09,99 --> 00:14:11,26
So if you know the land.

174
00:14:11,92 --> 00:14:16,92
The laws of the land are told to people and
the people don't wish to have any any.

175
00:14:17,51 --> 00:14:23,04
Respect for that while they just lose
respect in the eyes of the elders at all.

176
00:14:24,11 --> 00:14:28,05
And so they are you find a situation where
the elders just wont talk about any such

177
00:14:28,05 --> 00:14:28,97
thing because they can see

178
00:14:28,97 --> 00:14:31,22
that these people are really
not interested in law at all.

179
00:14:31,41 --> 00:14:33,08
They're not really interested in culture.

180
00:14:33,12 --> 00:14:40,07
They're basically just interested
in power. If people break the laws.

181
00:14:40,34 --> 00:14:45,21
Some people said to me.

182
00:14:46,93 --> 00:14:50,79
Well people curse themselves by
neglecting and by disregarding the laws

183
00:14:50,79 --> 00:14:52,53
that were given by the elders anyway.

184
00:14:52,67 --> 00:14:55,73
You know that curse doesn't come from the
elders or from the old people at all.

185
00:14:56,57 --> 00:15:01,34
They certainly didn't go around cursing
people you know people have respect there's

186
00:15:01,34 --> 00:15:04,62
no need to curse. It's only when
those people have disrespect

187
00:15:04,62 --> 00:15:05,41
that they curse themselves.

188
00:15:06,73 --> 00:15:08,81
You know it's personal responsibility
we're talking about here

189
00:15:08,81 --> 00:15:12,73
and that's a very strong mainstay
within the career culture is personal

190
00:15:12,73 --> 00:15:13,79
responsibility for your actions

191
00:15:14,56 --> 00:15:18,85
and if you don't have a responsibility
for your actions when your curst you do

192
00:15:18,85 --> 00:15:20,78
that to yourself no one else.

193
00:15:20,90 --> 00:15:24,25
No one else is to blame for that
you know the land has its laws

194
00:15:25,37 --> 00:15:31,99
and if you wish to transgress those
laws or do this. Disregard them.

195
00:15:32,22 --> 00:15:37,30
While your cursing yourself. That's all.

196
00:15:37,32 --> 00:15:41,19
You know it's paid its people its
people have disregard the laws

197
00:15:41,19 --> 00:15:43,08
that are cursing themselves
with poison water.

198
00:15:43,20 --> 00:15:48,09
You know the disk the cursing themselves
with with heat from the cutting down of

199
00:15:48,09 --> 00:15:52,51
the rainforest the cursing themselves with
putting cattle on the cursing themselves

200
00:15:52,51 --> 00:15:53,94
with the poisons in their foods

201
00:15:53,94 --> 00:15:58,11
that cursing themselves out
people not cursing them for that.

202
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,37
You. Yes.

203
00:16:05,39 --> 00:16:10,52
This story.

204
00:16:12,40 --> 00:16:16,76
Well the rainbow serpent is
like other snake yelling

205
00:16:18,64 --> 00:16:24,34
and yelling back and. That's a
place of the rainbow serpent.

206
00:16:24,36 --> 00:16:29,04
And or the carpet snake the
bath one in the same and.

207
00:16:29,45 --> 00:16:35,44
That was a very strong center for the
brain by snake dreaming in the membrane

208
00:16:35,44 --> 00:16:37,26
valley its crystals.

209
00:16:38,46 --> 00:16:42,75
Because if they could rambus
like the crystal in the moon.

210
00:16:44,87 --> 00:16:50,44
So that was another place where
like i said with a healing.

211
00:16:50,46 --> 00:16:54,11
For all forms of healing that comes
under the demesne of carpets

212
00:16:54,11 --> 00:16:55,35
and of rainbow snake

213
00:16:58,92 --> 00:17:05,67
or the things you telling me
stories. Nothing's changed. No no.

214
00:17:08,18 --> 00:17:18,44
They can change the
dreamings can be added to.

215
00:17:19,44 --> 00:17:21,05
Basically the story remains the same.

216
00:17:23,09 --> 00:17:28,38
But they can be added to they can be given
another perspective because there are so

217
00:17:28,38 --> 00:17:33,79
many you've got 360 360 degrees.

218
00:17:34,63 --> 00:17:37,05
And you can take any one of those paths.

219
00:17:37,92 --> 00:17:40,80
But whatever path you take
there's a dreaming story for

220
00:17:40,80 --> 00:17:43,92
that because the old people had gone.

221
00:17:44,39 --> 00:17:44,87
On

222
00:17:44,87 --> 00:17:49,76
that path some time people throughout the
histories of this country people have been

223
00:17:49,76 --> 00:17:51,96
there. They've been there
and have done that.

224
00:17:53,39 --> 00:17:57,93
So nothing's really changed in this country
as far as i goes because no matter

225
00:17:57,93 --> 00:17:59,23
where you go in this country.

226
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,96
It's been walked before someone
had been along that same track

227
00:18:06,70 --> 00:18:07,41
that you're following.

228
00:18:08,48 --> 00:18:13,20
So in other words there's always been
someone ahead of you who has been there.

229
00:18:14,74 --> 00:18:19,13
So you're just following their
track. No matter where you go.

230
00:18:20,28 --> 00:18:24,38
And i'm not just talking about like
human form but a good homosapien form.

231
00:18:24,52 --> 00:18:29,55
You know in a totem way you
know totem your totem as been

232
00:18:29,55 --> 00:18:34,94
that way you know we met lizard form or
in that snake form or in that bird full

233
00:18:35,74 --> 00:18:40,56
or in that waterfall. You've been there.
You've been through that way before.

234
00:18:41,78 --> 00:18:45,88
Nothing has changed. It's no surprise

235
00:18:48,42 --> 00:18:52,47
that people.

236
00:18:53,46 --> 00:18:56,61
Live before they've been there before.

237
00:18:59,12 --> 00:19:03,18
There's the dreaming stories like i
was saying with the bagel people

238
00:19:03,18 --> 00:19:09,39
and with an important people and that's
still occurring that still happening.

239
00:19:10,78 --> 00:19:15,90
And there is a there's a happy ending.
There's a happy ending to it.

240
00:19:19,10 --> 00:19:24,16
If people. People want to learn the culture
and they want to learn the language.

241
00:19:24,44 --> 00:19:26,05
Now the language.

242
00:19:26,90 --> 00:19:27,76
In the nimbin area

243
00:19:27,76 --> 00:19:31,95
and up in the bungalow an area has been
given the go ahead by the elders to be

244
00:19:31,95 --> 00:19:35,04
taught and they're teaching it.

245
00:19:36,01 --> 00:19:38,87
So the language needs to go out and

246
00:19:38,88 --> 00:19:43,18
when people start learning the language
of the land the indigenous language.

247
00:19:43,45 --> 00:19:49,78
They then automatically
have a deed to the land

248
00:19:51,15 --> 00:19:54,54
as far as their standing.

249
00:19:57,12 --> 00:19:59,33
Of that land you speak the language.

250
00:20:01,95 --> 00:20:05,48
You're banjo in which you're speaking
the language you're speaking bundle

251
00:20:05,48 --> 00:20:07,59
and which.

252
00:20:07,61 --> 00:20:12,03
And you learning the language learning the
dreaming learning the significance of

253
00:20:12,03 --> 00:20:18,89
the language because the language gives
specific references to the sacred

254
00:20:18,89 --> 00:20:22,93
places and what they mean i can talk

255
00:20:22,93 --> 00:20:27,20
and explain things in english
and to my face goes blue

256
00:20:29,64 --> 00:20:32,61
but unless the if you learn bungalow
then i talk to you when bhonsle

257
00:20:32,61 --> 00:20:34,54
or the elders are talking to you in mind

258
00:20:34,54 --> 00:20:41,36
and then you get the full
import of one word what

259
00:20:42,43 --> 00:20:47,86
the other inferences are on the spirit level
on the earth level in the water level

260
00:20:47,86 --> 00:20:50,75
and all of these things so

261
00:20:50,76 --> 00:20:56,85
that gives to a sort of like a deed of.

262
00:20:56,87 --> 00:20:59,28
Sharing the land.

263
00:20:59,33 --> 00:21:05,08
They're called no longer which is
ours then it becomes ours not yours

264
00:21:05,08 --> 00:21:09,99
and mine which is the
situation that exists now.

265
00:21:11,20 --> 00:21:13,65
And it's very important
to learn the language.

266
00:21:14,60 --> 00:21:16,83
So people listening to
this talk or whatever

267
00:21:17,75 --> 00:21:23,24
that if they can make an effort to
learn the language of their local area

268
00:21:23,24 --> 00:21:29,63
and to approach kori people in the
elders for that and and to get

269
00:21:29,63 --> 00:21:30,06
that culture

270
00:21:30,06 --> 00:21:34,68
and language happening within their
communities as it is up here in the bundle

271
00:21:34,68 --> 00:21:41,24
and there won't be as much confusion about

272
00:21:41,24 --> 00:21:47,81
land rights because that comes from the
rights of the land the land has rights.

273
00:21:47,91 --> 00:21:51,74
These are the lands rights.

274
00:21:53,77 --> 00:21:58,70
People the human beings the
human dreaming is to maintain.

275
00:22:01,88 --> 00:22:07,22
And to respect the laws of the
land and the rights of the land

276
00:22:07,98 --> 00:22:14,25
and if people don't enforce or if
they show a lack of interest in.

277
00:22:14,87 --> 00:22:17,58
The land's rights. Well we all die.

278
00:22:18,63 --> 00:22:19,15
That's as simple as

279
00:22:19,15 --> 00:22:25,53
that because the land is the law

280
00:22:27,07 --> 00:22:35,99
and no human being is greater
than the law go back to mention.

281
00:22:36,01 --> 00:22:42,88
People going to. Think. As.

282
00:22:45,27 --> 00:22:48,09
Well there was a tradition
of people coming from.

283
00:22:49,47 --> 00:22:49,64
Far

284
00:22:49,65 --> 00:22:55,72
and wide from the far reaches of this
continent come into nimbin for giving given

285
00:22:55,72 --> 00:23:01,93
that ability to fly. Now people can
interpret others all sorts of things a is

286
00:23:01,93 --> 00:23:06,69
that a physical is a yogic process that
they're talking about when there's a fly.

287
00:23:07,67 --> 00:23:13,44
Well yes we all people did
physically move through the air

288
00:23:18,69 --> 00:23:20,06
but that was a time back then.

289
00:23:21,83 --> 00:23:25,52
That was a time back then there's different
ways to move through the air now

290
00:23:25,52 --> 00:23:28,51
without having to bounce up

291
00:23:28,51 --> 00:23:35,44
and down on your pointy
like t m. Sorry motion.

292
00:23:35,46 --> 00:23:40,31
But you know like there's other ways.
There's other means to fly through the air.

293
00:23:40,83 --> 00:23:44,60
I mean people can do that
physically now anyway. Through.

294
00:23:45,41 --> 00:23:48,42
You know planes or through. Flying a kite.

295
00:23:48,95 --> 00:23:53,28
Or whatever you know doing stuff
like that. I mean that's there.

296
00:23:55,00 --> 00:23:59,51
People can ab-soul down the rock.
You know. And so on and so on.

297
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,50
That's done physically.
What was on the other.

298
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:10,74
Rainforest you.

299
00:24:12,95 --> 00:24:19,77
Better see we're talking
about this 200 year period

300
00:24:21,58 --> 00:24:21,71
when.

301
00:24:23,42 --> 00:24:28,93
The old people had no need as such for
specific people to take care of their

302
00:24:28,93 --> 00:24:34,12
healing and to have responsibility for.

303
00:24:35,37 --> 00:24:37,70
Someone else's health. I mean that

304
00:24:37,70 --> 00:24:41,10
that was everyone's responsibility for
their own health in the way and the way

305
00:24:41,10 --> 00:24:41,50
that it was

306
00:24:41,50 --> 00:24:47,54
that the old people led their
lifestyle anyway excluded sickness

307
00:24:48,64 --> 00:24:53,88
and so on and if people did come
down with a sickness is that they.

308
00:24:53,90 --> 00:24:58,42
You know there was family. Remedies.

309
00:24:59,50 --> 00:25:01,14
Plant knowledge where they can just go

310
00:25:01,14 --> 00:25:04,14
and fix themselves up by feeling
a little bit out of sorts.

311
00:25:04,83 --> 00:25:08,10
Or stuff of nothing major.

312
00:25:08,11 --> 00:25:10,81
But within the still want to do
your period because of the sickness

313
00:25:10,81 --> 00:25:16,51
that did come to this land there were people
who were specialised you had to become

314
00:25:16,51 --> 00:25:21,12
specialised. And so like i'm saying
with this martial law business.

315
00:25:22,35 --> 00:25:26,24
You know there were people who specifically
became warriors people specifically

316
00:25:27,18 --> 00:25:33,37
were designated we and some who civically
there's an added other other tasks.

317
00:25:35,86 --> 00:25:38,29
Because like i said it was.

318
00:25:38,31 --> 00:25:43,37
Oppressive times and people were
concerned with just surviving.

319
00:25:45,28 --> 00:25:50,79
So there were people who who were given
the tasks of being custodians of certain

320
00:25:50,79 --> 00:25:53,32
ologies so on

321
00:25:53,32 --> 00:25:59,79
and so on because the majority of our
people were concerned with with surviving.

322
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,59
With with hiding and running.

323
00:26:07,52 --> 00:26:08,81
So it's it's a tradition

324
00:26:08,81 --> 00:26:14,57
that smallest was been amplified over the
last hundred years where certain people

325
00:26:14,57 --> 00:26:23,03
were given a training for healing.

326
00:26:23,05 --> 00:26:28,21
So the story. Has a happy ending.

327
00:26:28,29 --> 00:26:32,11
How do you think why you think you. I.

328
00:26:32,68 --> 00:26:37,77
Strong faith in them and where people in
them and will. Well they already have.

329
00:26:37,85 --> 00:26:38,62
I mean there's attrition o

330
00:26:38,62 --> 00:26:43,21
that in the last 20 years with people
are exploring alternative healing.

331
00:26:43,88 --> 00:26:50,85
Alternative thinking and methods for 30
powers and and so on so on. You know.

332
00:26:50,91 --> 00:26:52,49
So that's a happy story.

333
00:26:52,73 --> 00:26:57,08
Same as it was the same as this in the
dreaming story where the people were taken.

334
00:26:58,48 --> 00:27:00,71
Who are outcasts basically from.

335
00:27:02,29 --> 00:27:07,63
The invading people and they were
taken by an inborn up to nimbin

336
00:27:07,63 --> 00:27:13,12
and they were taught
medicine and toward healing.

337
00:27:13,14 --> 00:27:16,08
To take back down to their people.

338
00:27:19,40 --> 00:27:22,47
And say good law you know given
sacred or in things like

339
00:27:22,47 --> 00:27:27,20
that to to take to their
people to heal to fix them.

340
00:27:28,19 --> 00:27:32,18
You know to say that you know
it's going to be all right.

341
00:27:32,39 --> 00:27:35,96
You know like don't panic
and the human spirit is.

342
00:27:36,63 --> 00:27:42,76
The most resilient thing
in the universe in place

343
00:27:43,98 --> 00:27:46,24
yet as good. Again.
