00:00:13,45 --> 00:00:17,99
Identification. This is session for.

2
00:00:18,01 --> 00:00:28,95
With FAITH BANDLER recorded with Carolyn Craig in Sydney on Friday the seventh of June one thousand nine hundred

3
00:00:28,95 --> 00:00:56,34
seventy. This is site A and the interview will begin in approximately ten seconds time and of identification of. Faith.

4
00:00:56,36 --> 00:01:02,67
You know that the experience of the depression meant a great deal to you and.

5
00:01:04,21 --> 00:01:13,71
I believe would you like to talk about what that meant to you and your family while. Your side should talk about this.

6
00:01:16,07 --> 00:01:27,95
My father died you know twenty four when we was still living in and we moved away from there. Very soon after.

7
00:01:28,05 --> 00:01:45,00
I think it was sometime at nineteen twenty six. I was already at school probably first year out of you to go. And.

8
00:01:47,62 --> 00:01:57,26
I was too young to know to a stranger it's only now as I look back I think about it you know I think about the clothes

9
00:01:57,26 --> 00:01:59,06
my mother herself used to wear

10
00:01:59,06 --> 00:02:07,94
and they were of the very best quality good clothes like those test socks white blouse it was.

11
00:02:08,99 --> 00:02:20,68
Kids nothing like had to be the soft. Sought to skid boots and things began to change like in one hundred twenty seven.

12
00:02:21,2 --> 00:02:34,02
We were already living in. And I recall my class being asked to. Come the next day all spruced up in him best clothes.

13
00:02:34,51 --> 00:02:41,2
We didn't wear uniforms in primary school. And so I.

14
00:02:41,21 --> 00:02:43,3
My mother spruced me have and

15
00:02:44,14 --> 00:02:52,26
when I got to scold a whole class was taken from the school to the local railway station

16
00:02:53,2 --> 00:02:55,73
and all classes were taken with a teacher.

17
00:02:56,89 --> 00:03:02,67
I think it was in the month of February but I wouldn't be sure but I never it was the month.

18
00:03:03,16 --> 00:03:09,04
That the Federal Parliament House in Cannes promoters opened.

19
00:03:10,32 --> 00:03:19,6
Because the purpose of that trip to the Raju station was to welcome the Queen Mother who they in was the Duchess of

20
00:03:19,6 --> 00:03:24,1
York and her husband who became king was the Duke of York

21
00:03:24,1 --> 00:03:31,28
and they'd come out to open the he new Parliament House in Canberra and those days of course I'd come

22
00:03:31,28 --> 00:03:42,61
and get on a train and go to all the at back places including Mumbai. And we were taken here. And I recall that.

23
00:03:42,95 --> 00:03:48,44
They were in an all white tray the train was white. But it was a steam train if you please.

24
00:03:49,05 --> 00:03:50,28
And she

25
00:03:50,28 --> 00:03:59,3
and her husband where a school should out with only officials to sit on the platform there was a platform that sort of

26
00:03:59,3 --> 00:04:02,62
face. The public.

27
00:04:03,53 --> 00:04:09,17
There was a platform where the train came in and you walked through passage way than the was not a very long for.

28
00:04:09,51 --> 00:04:23,8
Used usually for the trucks. Taxis or whatever. And this woman and her husband and I set like images on this platform.

29
00:04:23,82 --> 00:04:32,66
And we had to stand there in the heat. And sing God Save the gracious. Whoever it was King then.

30
00:04:34,33 --> 00:04:42,09
And the long speeches by people who didn't mean anything to me including the mayor and over.

31
00:04:45,93 --> 00:04:58,52
And so we were then taken back to school and told we could. Now that was nine hundred twenty seven. I think.

32
00:05:00,33 --> 00:05:13,64
And it was not until twenty twenty eight twenty and that I saw changes developing in our household and first of all.

33
00:05:16,03 --> 00:05:20,9
My mother was battling obviously to keep things together.

34
00:05:21,92 --> 00:05:30,17
The boys were all out working and I came home and would give my mother extra money they'd never put it you know him.

35
00:05:30,18 --> 00:05:40,75
They just leave it on the kitchen table. And. We were still eating good food in twenty eight twenty nine.

36
00:05:40,76 --> 00:05:50,77
We were that dependent on what we had grown. And who was still there into the butcher shop and the grocer's shop.

37
00:05:52,23 --> 00:06:08,21
Whenever the need was there. In nineteen thirty. And and you know as well up in primary school. Very much.

38
00:06:10,6 --> 00:06:12,24
And I was aware that it was.

39
00:06:12,29 --> 00:06:22,01
Difficult for my mother to keep for me I was aware that she was becoming far more dependent on what we.

40
00:06:22,03 --> 00:06:31,88
We were no longer buying any of those luxuries like apples or oranges which were not grown up. And.

41
00:06:31,89 --> 00:06:40,52
Like I can recall my mother saying. You do the shopping get a pound pounder steak for brazing or whatever.

42
00:06:41,58 --> 00:06:45,91
And the butcher would always throw a little extra.

43
00:06:45,93 --> 00:06:51,85
Like a Man to add a couple of sausages or something like that and I would go home

44
00:06:51,85 --> 00:06:54,71
and my mother would say oh yes he is a time man and you see.

45
00:06:55,16 --> 00:07:10,46
And it seemed to me that previously about you would never do that and they you know came the day.

46
00:07:07,04 --> 00:07:20,76
when I had to do what was called a Q.C. And asked what was known as Class and the sound of my school shoes coming off.

47
00:07:21,5 --> 00:07:25,76
And I can remember my mother being very anxious that I should do that excess.

48
00:07:27,01 --> 00:07:38,2
And she had a great big meal which we called a power. And she thread that I have. And she stitched all of that back on.

49
00:07:38,2 --> 00:07:42,4
So I could get. Her own.

50
00:07:42,42 --> 00:07:52,95
Boots by then she was in shoes I think women were in choosing and polishing her shoes that much more.

51
00:07:53,48 --> 00:08:01,33
And instead of all her old shoes had flown out and she went in boats and shoes which were the chiefest of all shoes

52
00:08:01,33 --> 00:08:04,68
and she'd wear those around the house and in the garden.

53
00:08:05,1 --> 00:08:13,02
And that was the real come down if you put your feet in same shoes in my mother's. It's been. Different today.

54
00:08:13,09 --> 00:08:24,38
You know if you get around this. Night Reeboks and all that you know depression no such thing. Of course was no no no.

55
00:08:24,39 --> 00:08:31,8
If you're same shoes. You're at the very bottom of the ladder. And I go into town.

56
00:08:31,82 --> 00:08:36,53
With my mother and there'd be that many more people wearing same shoes.

57
00:08:36,54 --> 00:08:45,55
And I'm like today as my mother and her peers or is it you're not dressed if you haven't got decent shoes.

58
00:08:46,55 --> 00:08:53,84
To see so many women in particular coming in from the outback like you know a few miles out of town

59
00:08:54,55 --> 00:09:01,67
and coming in on Saturday or Friday which if it was either one or the other it would be soon choose

60
00:09:01,67 --> 00:09:10,37
and I can say also Mrs Towne she was wearing the same shoes and her mother said the poor do you.

61
00:09:10,79 --> 00:09:17,5
Goodness me it's a terrible life for the people. And.

62
00:09:17,52 --> 00:09:22,35
These are all little signs that things were things getting less getting worse.

63
00:09:22,65 --> 00:09:29,33
Yes And then we were no longer in prayed and prayed in fact became a luxury.

64
00:09:30,25 --> 00:09:37,63
You know older sisters and my mother would make that much more damper or scar

65
00:09:37,63 --> 00:09:50,39
or Johnny cakes you know things like that as supplements and. There were other changes and then finally.

66
00:09:53,73 --> 00:09:55,72
Just stayed another two years at school.

67
00:09:56,07 --> 00:10:03,67
But it became impossible and people of my age and I were all white people who we always thought had much more money

68
00:10:03,67 --> 00:10:07,06
and income than we had but I hadn't actually

69
00:10:07,76 --> 00:10:11,74
and I began leaving school because I couldn't afford to stay there anymore. Oh.

70
00:10:12,29 --> 00:10:23,21
And kids were leaving at thirty and forty. And I thought you know if they can play second I'm sick of this.

71
00:10:24,06 --> 00:10:35,59
So I think I was just about sixteen fifteen. But there I think I was coming up sixteen and I thought.

72
00:10:35,61 --> 00:10:44,62
Well I did but that also opened the before that. Like I saw people standing outside of the police station.

73
00:10:47,11 --> 00:10:49,91
And first of all a queue would be say ten or twelve

74
00:10:50,81 --> 00:10:58,74
and that queue grew over the weeks as it were in the nineteen thirty.

75
00:11:00,58 --> 00:11:15,53
And a bit after that but with my own ass I saw that cube growing in who were independent people. Men who had true.

76
00:11:16,72 --> 00:11:19,66
And although there was a thing as farmers relief.

77
00:11:19,94 --> 00:11:24,55
You'd see families standing in the queue and it was getting longer and longer

78
00:11:25,28 --> 00:11:33,26
and our boys looked on these people as people who not only had more money than we. But people who were more secure.

79
00:11:33,47 --> 00:11:38,08
And here they were waiting for an adult ticket.

80
00:11:38,1 --> 00:11:44,56
A ticket that would give some license to go to certain grocery shops in the town

81
00:11:45,48 --> 00:11:49,73
and buy something like I've forgotten but I'm out of the you know.

82
00:11:50,88 --> 00:11:55,38
Two pounds worth of groceries which was a lot of money in an awful lot.

83
00:11:56,45 --> 00:12:03,36
And so then I had a brother who got in that queue because the train was finished the season was finished

84
00:12:03,36 --> 00:12:10,48
and he got in the queue and he'd come home. And he this was a brother who came home and lived with us.

85
00:12:10,61 --> 00:12:17,47
He didn't live in the house. That we were living in. He actually lived in that was a churning.

86
00:12:17,49 --> 00:12:19,15
But he'd come home with a free.

87
00:12:20,74 --> 00:12:32,84
I think that was once a month for not coming with a few slabs of cheese tin fish herrings into matters sauce

88
00:12:32,84 --> 00:12:48,94
and packets a chair lease or cancer cheap food but a lot of what and lots of flour and sugar. That I couldn't buy.

89
00:12:48,96 --> 00:12:52,27
Because bacon was not a luxury bank and was cheap

90
00:12:52,27 --> 00:13:01,71
and you could go to one of the local store then buy a pound of part of a sixpence.

91
00:13:01,72 --> 00:13:10,82
Because if they couldn't get they had to. Now would he have money and then I saw all of this occurring before.

92
00:13:10,84 --> 00:13:13,94
And my brother wearing say.

93
00:13:14,91 --> 00:13:20,07
And he used to use an excuse and pretend it wasn't because he didn't have enough money to buy kid

94
00:13:20,07 --> 00:13:30,88
but same shoes you could walk much faster in them. And the clothes would wear out. And they weren't replace him.

95
00:13:31,00 --> 00:13:37,57
You know it was always a great thing to replace clothes before they were worn out and my mother

96
00:13:37,57 --> 00:13:47,00
and my uncle who was a father figure. Then because my father and I would take us to the local the very best local shop.

97
00:13:47,02 --> 00:13:50,95
It was cool man by the name of proud Ford.

98
00:13:51,44 --> 00:13:58,4
And like I knew him and he knew them and I would always greet each other and I pulled a high chair for him

99
00:13:58,4 --> 00:14:01,86
and he'd say we brought the girls in to select material.

100
00:14:02,06 --> 00:14:07,56
And we would select usually a feature which was beautiful daughter of different colors

101
00:14:09,72 --> 00:14:11,25
and that wasn't happening any more.

102
00:14:12,41 --> 00:14:15,15
And when the dresses were at they wore out

103
00:14:15,88 --> 00:14:24,00
and there was a local Draper shop which was not it wasn't considered the place to go to the issue really.

104
00:14:24,02 --> 00:14:26,28
Because all the stuff was cheap and wasn't good.

105
00:14:27,36 --> 00:14:35,33
And my mother would never go to them but now she began to come and the attendance would come out into the street

106
00:14:35,33 --> 00:14:43,14
and big people to go in and we have this on special LATE say you know to me six months.

107
00:14:43,16 --> 00:14:50,82
Or it's only a shilling a day and my mother began going there and that was a big leap there.

108
00:14:51,13 --> 00:14:57,7
No longer too proud for it's. I think in one of your books you talk about your mother.

109
00:14:58,04 --> 00:15:05,72
Hosting a lot of the men who were out of work in a depression they'd come to your place to sit around and talk

110
00:15:05,72 --> 00:15:14,71
and she would. She would give them hospitality. Yes well when of course. When I was still at school.

111
00:15:16,52 --> 00:15:19,32
The depression of course had taken hold in the city.

112
00:15:19,72 --> 00:15:25,84
There was no doubt about that and actually I remember one family coming all the way from Melbourne.

113
00:15:26,45 --> 00:15:35,09
Out of the city of Melbourne to live in a house that wasn't very far from our place whose relative to relatives didn't

114
00:15:35,09 --> 00:15:40,3
have need of it and they lived there rent free and they sold all the Christmases and come at once.

115
00:15:40,61 --> 00:15:45,59
No longer having a landlord they could go outside and pick fresh fruit.

116
00:15:45,61 --> 00:15:56,6
And so my mother went Oh my brothers really had left working on different.

117
00:15:56,62 --> 00:16:03,04
Except maybe who came and went and he being there was a great help because he got all this dull food.

118
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:19,14
And men began to arrive from. Southern cities Melbourne and Sydney in particular. They've just come and ask.

119
00:16:19,58 --> 00:16:23,4
Could they cut a little mood. For some braid.

120
00:16:23,96 --> 00:16:29,19
There were some were from banks because the banks had closed

121
00:16:29,19 --> 00:16:38,92
and some were students mainly students who would come up as far. And some.

122
00:16:39,61 --> 00:16:47,37
They get a fishing rod and get a fish and roasted on the bank they do things like this but when they come to matter.

123
00:16:48,81 --> 00:16:55,67
She don't give them enough. First of all that comes from board chop some wood.

124
00:16:56,34 --> 00:17:02,21
And she'd never trust them to do any gardening because she said they didn't have a clue

125
00:17:02,92 --> 00:17:09,21
and they should give them a knife and a spoon and direct them to the pan Apple patch.

126
00:17:09,22 --> 00:17:16,34
If the primary force were right and I would have to tell them how to cut the top of the pot apple

127
00:17:16,34 --> 00:17:23,46
and then scoop it up with a spoon and make a meal of it and I wouldn't go back to the house

128
00:17:23,46 --> 00:17:30,29
and my mother would watch when they'd go she said to make sure that if the spoon.

129
00:17:34,51 --> 00:17:48,14
It's impossible for me to describe the misery in seeing proud people.

130
00:17:52,51 --> 00:18:03,39
Terrible thing really the depression and these men would come and they tell others the same

131
00:18:04,09 --> 00:18:07,83
and the local showground would be a place where they would camp.

132
00:18:08,09 --> 00:18:12,12
I recall on one morning very early at half past six the.

133
00:18:12,29 --> 00:18:17,41
Call police sergeant who was in charge of the local cop shop arrived on his who're.

134
00:18:17,77 --> 00:18:22,61
And got his Coulter out and my mother went out to greet him

135
00:18:22,61 --> 00:18:28,85
and he said Mrs nursing we have just found a party at the showground it's very dark

136
00:18:29,86 --> 00:18:36,67
and I have wondered if you knew anyone who would come and identify it because it might be an island person.

137
00:18:38,73 --> 00:18:46,64
And we found someone a man who wouldn't know identified it but it happened a white person had gone down.

138
00:18:46,66 --> 00:18:56,05
And people were just dying. And although I thought I had terrible all of this really.

139
00:18:56,97 --> 00:19:06,11
And my sister incidentally cat got a job at a local farm she was older than me brighter than me.

140
00:19:06,12 --> 00:19:14,55
Harley intelligent extremely sensitive and very loving and very responsible.

141
00:19:15,42 --> 00:19:22,73
And she took a job with a local a local farmer who. Had chooks.

142
00:19:23,22 --> 00:19:29,07
And I traced chokes and fill their cart up and take them from the hood and over

143
00:19:29,07 --> 00:19:35,68
and beautiful fresh books their name was Affleck and they came from South Africa.

144
00:19:35,7 --> 00:19:41,86
And the woman the wife was Australian but he'd come from South Africa.

145
00:19:41,88 --> 00:19:51,6
And so she came to our house one day and asked if anyone needed. And my sister. Oh yes I'll come for you.

146
00:19:52,62 --> 00:19:58,29
So she said well if you must be there by half past four in the morning.

147
00:19:58,8 --> 00:20:03,96
Well it was no trouble to us because we went to bed with the chicks and half the time.

148
00:20:05,28 --> 00:20:15,00
So careful to leave her four o'clock and. Climb over the it's green. Her long legs go like lightning.

149
00:20:16,36 --> 00:20:28,74
And kill the chokes and then stand at the bench with Mrs Affleck and dress. No gloves no nothing. And dress nicely.

150
00:20:28,76 --> 00:20:33,1
And then you can have her six Affleck.

151
00:20:33,12 --> 00:20:41,89
The Affleck's would if they had little wear little cock with all the grease trucks and they'd do the rounds of town.

152
00:20:42,32 --> 00:20:50,37
And you could choke a dress check for two and sixpence.

153
00:20:50,38 --> 00:21:02,22
Well the good thing about calf working there was the cheaper in the giblets. And. What I proposed soup.

154
00:21:03,38 --> 00:21:10,31
With lots of vegetable it was marvelous and then she'd make a kind of johnny cake

155
00:21:11,19 --> 00:21:17,03
and she put the giblets in the johnny cake. And followed it over and that would be a meal.

156
00:21:17,67 --> 00:21:21,59
But if you are wonderful and you know a lot of things like that you put on.

157
00:21:21,92 --> 00:21:31,07
So in some ways compared to people in town the people in the city. Really lived a relatively.

158
00:21:31,09 --> 00:21:47,46
Except you know when I see my mother straining to textbooks. And. We could no longer afford to buy.

159
00:21:47,47 --> 00:21:57,48
Because that person that I used to do my homework. And we started to use candles because they were cheap.

160
00:21:59,27 --> 00:22:07,45
And I do my homework by candlelight. Little these things that made it extremely hard.

161
00:22:09,94 --> 00:22:15,3
We have for all those for breakfast because. Of course you could buy a pound of products for a bad happens.

162
00:22:16,27 --> 00:22:25,58
And at the time you realize the value very good for us. Anyhow.

163
00:22:27,79 --> 00:22:31,74
I can recall people coming cousins of our house who lived in

164
00:22:33,43 --> 00:22:39,41
and they were very flash they were the children of a stepsister of my mother.

165
00:22:40,91 --> 00:22:47,04
And they came to them came and my mother said you can stay with us.

166
00:22:47,55 --> 00:22:54,41
And I thought I should have gotten a first soon as we should be worrying about them

167
00:22:54,41 --> 00:22:58,97
but the truth in fact that in Brisbane I had absolutely nothing just nothing

168
00:22:58,97 --> 00:23:05,78
and it was something for them to hit such a table that. Their character food.

169
00:23:05,8 --> 00:23:14,44
And look at it because they had a nice house in the city

170
00:23:15,26 --> 00:23:24,96
but if I went back to that house they wouldn't have said if so at least I had food with us and.

171
00:23:24,98 --> 00:23:33,04
Oh yes and then one night. And this must never. Night in thirty seven.

172
00:23:33,31 --> 00:23:40,2
And you see we have told through all this to stay. You know to stay healthy.

173
00:23:40,33 --> 00:23:57,00
Apart from battling to keep the clothes on and back. Was it difficult feel mother I mean I had. Didn't.

174
00:23:58,44 --> 00:24:01,17
My mother had remarkable inner recently and.

175
00:24:03,7 --> 00:24:09,53
She just took it as it came and most women who did not continue to make ends meet.

176
00:24:09,88 --> 00:24:17,37
There were major terrific stuff those. And there was nothing from the government to give them.

177
00:24:17,39 --> 00:24:30,31
Like today there was a lot of care. A lot of battering and that saved their lives in the country after things like.

178
00:24:30,99 --> 00:24:37,54
The Irish families on their way to mass would bring us homemade biscuits.

179
00:24:37,56 --> 00:24:44,87
Of homemade tomato sauce and are very often every Sunday morning as a matter of fact.

180
00:24:45,75 --> 00:24:55,39
And we leave at the slip arrive home little boxes of whatever fruit and eggs.

181
00:24:56,66 --> 00:25:00,92
What if it was going yams sweet potatoes or something like that

182
00:25:01,69 --> 00:25:10,51
and that time I had asked him over for quite a few days during the week. There was no OK sure.

183
00:25:10,56 --> 00:25:22,94
And it was very little cash. And I was given. Was always even six months on a Monday because that was banking.

184
00:25:24,45 --> 00:25:33,87
The time came and my mother said look. You use that sixpence to buy two three pence each beautiful.

185
00:25:33,89 --> 00:25:40,92
And the parliament would come here to the school nice little card with a little tiny little chimney smoking.

186
00:25:41,58 --> 00:25:52,58
And I found that often the only big three or four of us buying it because it would come out and very often.

187
00:25:56,01 --> 00:26:07,28
In the winter. You know kids would come out bleeding feet to school. Frostbitten. And there was no way.

188
00:26:07,3 --> 00:26:16,76
They didn't have open fires. But most of them had. They'd have to stay in the kitchen. Most people cooked by a few.

189
00:26:16,77 --> 00:26:25,35
And a quarter an extent they put us but we not only had a sister. We had fires. It kept us.

190
00:26:26,78 --> 00:26:36,01
In the blankets became a thing in. And lank so expensive to buy. Blankets.

191
00:26:36,03 --> 00:26:45,32
I would just imagine that was never that never seem to be reduced and it was really cold in the winter. And.

192
00:26:47,17 --> 00:26:49,5
The blankets began to wear his.

193
00:26:49,52 --> 00:26:57,31
And my mother would say calf would you put another patch on that blanket use that are all cutting and I've cut out.

194
00:26:58,1 --> 00:27:03,6
And women women making petticoats getting air and like if you had.

195
00:27:04,09 --> 00:27:08,02
A dress that was worn in the seat would you cut the top part.

196
00:27:08,47 --> 00:27:24,11
And cut it into patches for a patch quilt and do you turn things inside out. You had to use a lot of invention.

197
00:27:24,12 --> 00:27:34,58
I have so little. And John my oldest brother was a great need. And you can buy skins of all cheaply.

198
00:27:35,73 --> 00:27:50,4
You couldn't buy things like blankets and I can remember using big knitting rug for a baby and put next.

199
00:27:52,91 --> 00:28:02,33
But that was another thing that I hope people being evicted. And.

200
00:28:02,35 --> 00:28:10,61
But we didn't care you know I like my mother cared but we were too young to care what was happening to other people.

201
00:28:12,29 --> 00:28:59,74
Miracle to keep us afloat. It was something very significant that I could finish. It's left me that I think I've got.

202
00:29:09,85 --> 00:29:23,22
It. Now what happened was that my mother had money in the bank. Which was then called a savings bank.

203
00:29:23,7 --> 00:29:37,26
And that was a government owned bank that later became the Commonwealth Bank. And if you want me. It was very hard.

204
00:29:37,74 --> 00:29:45,57
You were only allowed to take so much out. And this is what I couldn't bloody well understand it was our money.

205
00:29:45,92 --> 00:29:52,17
And why should my mama go and stand in a queue for her own money and I only take so much.

206
00:29:52,31 --> 00:30:00,64
I thought it was almost like the situation for Aboriginal people in Queensland you know if they wanted the money they

207
00:30:00,64 --> 00:30:04,91
earned which is banked in the Commonwealth Bank they took a police car.

208
00:30:06,29 --> 00:30:09,59
The cops and say I want to buy a new bike or a new coat

209
00:30:09,59 --> 00:30:16,61
or something like that before they could use their own money to the bank put these restrictions on everybody. Oh yes.

210
00:30:17,26 --> 00:30:26,15
No one no one and you tended to door closed. Most of the time or some of the time.

211
00:30:26,32 --> 00:30:33,61
It's all a bit vague to me but that was what distressed me was that my mother would take me into the bank.

212
00:30:33,63 --> 00:30:38,1
And she would only be allowed like to drove five pounds or something

213
00:30:38,1 --> 00:30:45,29
and she had quite a lot of money in the bank because by this time my uncle had died

214
00:30:45,29 --> 00:30:51,86
and he left her a bag of gold song for us. And they were in the bank.

215
00:30:54,98 --> 00:31:00,1
So fortunate and she wanted to take them out because the local.

216
00:31:00,12 --> 00:31:09,01
Greek restaurant which is still a to this day much mention the list by name. They would that I would give.

217
00:31:09,03 --> 00:31:17,06
To Paris for goes over. And there's an awful lot of money.

218
00:31:17,08 --> 00:31:24,36
And we were all angry about this and now my file has some of his cousins and friends.

219
00:31:24,92 --> 00:31:31,35
It doesn't matter if it stops now there were people who paid money and they were careful

220
00:31:31,35 --> 00:31:38,57
and over into the Commonwealth Bank and there were about ten or twelve of them one day. They were all going for.
