1
00:00:13,40 --> 00:00:18,55
Well put on your niter application where
there wasn't as a practicing addict in

2
00:00:18,55 --> 00:00:22,93
this area there wasn't there wasn't
violence there wasn't a crime nor

3
00:00:22,93 --> 00:00:25,78
that the prostitution. There wasn't.

4
00:00:27,94 --> 00:00:29,99
All those hallmarks of addiction

5
00:00:29,99 --> 00:00:36,50
that my my friends in the city went through
was a lot gentler like in many ways

6
00:00:36,50 --> 00:00:40,99
like we still you know had to go. We
were still a lot more physically active.

7
00:00:41,45 --> 00:00:46,99
I mean we still climbed up and down the
mountains and hills and cars of water and.

8
00:00:48,92 --> 00:00:50,18
We still find eat a lot more.

9
00:00:51,91 --> 00:00:55,79
Yeah addiction was a lot kinder to me
out here than it would have been in the

10
00:00:55,79 --> 00:01:03,84
cities sure i come
legally without a doubt.

11
00:01:04,55 --> 00:01:09,58
Question. My brain is all right.

12
00:01:12,68 --> 00:01:15,32
I guess.

13
00:01:16,83 --> 00:01:20,81
As sunnyside you know life is a lot kind
of threat exam the country all the country

14
00:01:20,81 --> 00:01:21,50
addicts that i know

15
00:01:21,50 --> 00:01:28,33
and my own experiences lies in with this
as well we just didn't have to do it for

16
00:01:28,33 --> 00:01:29,69
all city addicts. To do

17
00:01:29,69 --> 00:01:33,23
and then i never had to prostitute myself
here i didn't have to steal from people

18
00:01:33,23 --> 00:01:38,55
other than just you know charging tourists
exorbitant amounts of money for dies you

19
00:01:38,56 --> 00:01:42,02
know i didn't have to you know
sell my soul to be an addict here

20
00:01:42,02 --> 00:01:45,80
and you know like i would if i couldn't
get it together to cook a meal i could

21
00:01:45,80 --> 00:01:48,79
always go to the rainbow and
have a meal there i mean i think

22
00:01:48,79 --> 00:01:52,72
that kept me alive it kept me out
of trouble for a really long time.

23
00:01:53,20 --> 00:01:57,50
You know the only time i
ever did go to a city and.

24
00:01:58,44 --> 00:02:00,63
You know i was a practicing addict
i'm. When it was just terrific.

25
00:02:00,91 --> 00:02:02,81
I had a really hard time for about three

26
00:02:02,81 --> 00:02:06,88
or four months until i could get it
together to come home again and.

27
00:02:08,61 --> 00:02:10,79
I think i mean for me like.

28
00:02:10,80 --> 00:02:13,81
I wasn't particularly upfront about
my diction of course everybody knew.

29
00:02:14,42 --> 00:02:16,86
But i didn't go around
discussing it with people

30
00:02:16,86 --> 00:02:20,23
and i guess i didn't pick up heroin and.

31
00:02:22,01 --> 00:02:26,01
I had about three years off i think
when i first came to the country and

32
00:02:26,01 --> 00:02:32,58
when it wasn't here for a while and.
You know i sort of did things in town.

33
00:02:32,58 --> 00:02:33,69
I was part of the community

34
00:02:33,69 --> 00:02:38,61
and so people gave me a lot of leeway for
a long time after i sort of became a

35
00:02:38,61 --> 00:02:43,83
practicing heroin addict again. I
think people still loved me and.

36
00:02:43,85 --> 00:02:49,63
You know i could get away with things
just this you know junkie in town and

37
00:02:49,63 --> 00:02:53,44
and i mean that's a lot to do with the
progression of my disease to you know like

38
00:02:54,14 --> 00:02:56,90
you start off as this sort of gay.

39
00:02:56,92 --> 00:03:00,62
Thing and it takes a long time for the
disease of addiction to wear you down

40
00:03:00,62 --> 00:03:04,28
and you know by the time i was 30 to.

41
00:03:04,30 --> 00:03:06,86
I was a pretty you know i was
a pretty worn out junkie

42
00:03:06,86 --> 00:03:10,98
and i want a lot of my friendships and a
lot of my family by that time and i guess.

43
00:03:12,52 --> 00:03:15,48
The only thing i had going for me
was that i was a country junkie and

44
00:03:15,48 --> 00:03:19,74
that i could survive a lot
more easily here in terms of.

45
00:03:19,75 --> 00:03:23,88
I guess must my physical self and my
psyche than i could a city junkie

46
00:03:25,61 --> 00:03:32,30
or about this person as well.

47
00:03:32,30 --> 00:03:35,35
I was i was one of those
sort of junkies that.

48
00:03:36,38 --> 00:03:42,21
Kept a lot of fronts up so i was my
son was always very well-dressed and.

49
00:03:43,39 --> 00:03:45,99
You know there was always money
for shoes and food and so on

50
00:03:45,99 --> 00:03:47,26
and i kept it from him

51
00:03:48,21 --> 00:03:52,48
that i was a junk you know really protected
him whereas a lot of people don't do

52
00:03:52,48 --> 00:03:55,76
that so much. I certainly didn't

53
00:03:55,76 --> 00:03:59,85
and i mean my mothering front was great
because i could say to myself i'm not.

54
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,37
Too bad a junkie because.

55
00:04:01,82 --> 00:04:04,55
Look my kids this that
and the other and so

56
00:04:04,55 --> 00:04:09,64
that was another part of my own denial about
the process of my diction basically in

57
00:04:09,64 --> 00:04:11,26
that.

58
00:04:11,28 --> 00:04:13,08
You know he grew up around smoking dope

59
00:04:13,08 --> 00:04:17,21
that everybody's kids did you know like the
cops came to our house one day to bust

60
00:04:17,21 --> 00:04:19,42
us and max sat on.

61
00:04:19,43 --> 00:04:24,33
A bad diet like a pillow and that
was his you know big claim to fame

62
00:04:24,33 --> 00:04:26,32
that you know the cops
came and i said on the day

63
00:04:26,32 --> 00:04:27,88
but they didn't find it does day to day

64
00:04:27,88 --> 00:04:31,84
and i mean most people's kids are
probably in that position in

65
00:04:31,84 --> 00:04:34,04
that we all had to tell our children that.

66
00:04:34,63 --> 00:04:36,51
You know what we smoke is illegal

67
00:04:36,51 --> 00:04:39,67
and so if anybody ever asks you
about it at school or whatever.

68
00:04:39,99 --> 00:04:43,17
No we do not do that thing and and

69
00:04:43,17 --> 00:04:47,03
that was just reality so it was always
brought up within the framework of that.

70
00:04:47,15 --> 00:04:49,05
Illegality i suppose.

71
00:04:49,09 --> 00:04:53,83
And let's say like narcotics
was uncool in the early days

72
00:04:53,83 --> 00:04:57,70
but so was alcohol so i mean we never went
and sat in pubs or anything like that.

73
00:04:57,93 --> 00:05:00,42
Like if you were a good hippy.

74
00:05:01,17 --> 00:05:04,45
You just didn't going to pubs and i
didn't going to pubs for about 10

75
00:05:04,46 --> 00:05:07,85
or 12 years it wasn't until
you know the mid 80s

76
00:05:07,85 --> 00:05:12,07
that i even ventured into the nimbin
pub and that was a just so weird.

77
00:05:12,09 --> 00:05:13,21
That i started drinking.

78
00:05:13,68 --> 00:05:15,72
And also the kids have been brought up

79
00:05:15,72 --> 00:05:19,28
and within the framework of an
extended family situation here.

80
00:05:19,39 --> 00:05:21,84
I mean that's one of
the things. No i mean.

81
00:05:22,45 --> 00:05:24,66
In country areas you have that

82
00:05:24,66 --> 00:05:30,23
but in communities all societies like
like we live in here i mean that that.

83
00:05:30,49 --> 00:05:33,20
That's even more fundamental.

84
00:05:33,29 --> 00:05:36,90
I mean the kids get together and
they hang around in in groups

85
00:05:36,90 --> 00:05:39,79
and we look after them.

86
00:05:40,60 --> 00:05:44,50
And i mean you know the community really
good you know the kids an audience

87
00:05:44,50 --> 00:05:47,17
and all the kids and all the
kids want to get together

88
00:05:47,17 --> 00:05:52,04
and you're looking after these groups
and so i'm basically in that situation.

89
00:05:52,69 --> 00:05:52,90
I mean.

90
00:05:54,59 --> 00:05:59,00
People carry i mean people you know if
people are having hard times whether it's

91
00:05:59,00 --> 00:06:02,82
through. Relationships
economics indiction whatever.

92
00:06:03,02 --> 00:06:07,58
I mean people get in there and see
what's happening and help each other out

93
00:06:07,58 --> 00:06:11,72
and so i think they fought with the kids
suffered a lot less than they would in a

94
00:06:11,72 --> 00:06:14,71
very housing commission flat
in the city or something like

95
00:06:14,71 --> 00:06:18,26
that as well i mean that's the thing
about country addiction too i mean it is

96
00:06:18,26 --> 00:06:19,65
different to the city addiction

97
00:06:19,65 --> 00:06:24,49
or the city process of addiction i mean i
magine there are people with with kids

98
00:06:24,49 --> 00:06:28,17
and so on who are city addicts but.

99
00:06:28,18 --> 00:06:33,98
I mean it's it's a very different scenario
of here like we we all have lived here

100
00:06:33,98 --> 00:06:38,37
for years and we all had kids our
kids went to school together

101
00:06:38,37 --> 00:06:42,75
and looked after each other and and we
looked after each other's kids as well.

102
00:06:43,13 --> 00:06:43,52
And so on.

103
00:06:43,63 --> 00:06:48,87
So you know it was it was a really different
trips to an isolated safe you're you

104
00:06:48,87 --> 00:06:50,98
know living in a flat and
st kilda or somewhere

105
00:06:50,98 --> 00:06:55,18
and you don't know other mothers
like we all knew everybody like we'd

106
00:06:55,18 --> 00:06:58,51
and we'd go to the school you know
like we would put on dark glasses

107
00:06:58,51 --> 00:07:01,59
and go to the school fete because we
were still part of the community.

108
00:07:01,66 --> 00:07:06,50
You know it's interesting
that there were about.

109
00:07:06,52 --> 00:07:08,68
That here in the community we go.

110
00:07:09,98 --> 00:07:13,91
You know your views on this

111
00:07:16,86 --> 00:07:21,82
issue. About four years.

112
00:07:23,00 --> 00:07:28,93
I think it's very very hard in
that. In people kind of race why.

113
00:07:28,95 --> 00:07:34,68
I think it's very hard in terms of community
notions of addiction because people

114
00:07:34,69 --> 00:07:40,04
kind of rifai addicts and see
them as the monstrous other

115
00:07:40,04 --> 00:07:44,84
and they see them as somebody to
be really feared and people forget

116
00:07:44,84 --> 00:07:49,58
that everybody has an addict or
an alcoholic in their families

117
00:07:49,58 --> 00:07:53,08
and i put the two into the same category.

118
00:07:53,10 --> 00:07:57,60
I had an uncle who was an alcoholic somebody
else has a sister who was an alcoholic.

119
00:07:58,14 --> 00:07:59,78
Somebody has a husband who's.

120
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:00,79
Drug addict you know

121
00:08:00,79 --> 00:08:07,27
and it's really important to not
let humans humanness flow away

122
00:08:07,27 --> 00:08:10,26
flow out the drain and i think
that when people talk about.

123
00:08:10,76 --> 00:08:13,04
The addicts and the drug problem.

124
00:08:13,07 --> 00:08:15,96
They just forget it's the person
who lives in the house next door

125
00:08:15,96 --> 00:08:20,34
and it's really really important to have
that sort of notion of of compassion

126
00:08:20,34 --> 00:08:24,61
and humanness with with talking about the
problem because otherwise you can't get

127
00:08:24,61 --> 00:08:29,62
any community kind of cohesiveness
happening. If you split the community.

128
00:08:29,63 --> 00:08:34,19
You don't you don't have to in fact search
for the solution you can just shove

129
00:08:34,19 --> 00:08:36,29
shove the people out of the community.

130
00:08:36,30 --> 00:08:39,72
You can show it you know close down
the method own program shut down

131
00:08:39,72 --> 00:08:41,94
and a looks change and then you
have people starting to die

132
00:08:42,87 --> 00:08:44,30
and then you have people
starting to get desperate

133
00:08:45,12 --> 00:08:48,31
and again you have you know possibly a
serious problem happening helps where

134
00:08:48,31 --> 00:08:51,10
but you know probably a serious
problem still happening here.

135
00:08:51,22 --> 00:08:57,69
I mean there are no kind of concrete
solvable solutions happening there's just

136
00:08:58,63 --> 00:09:00,93
the idea i think that.

137
00:09:02,64 --> 00:09:06,46
We have to look at the problem as a
community and and try and sort of.

138
00:09:08,79 --> 00:09:11,85
See the people with problems
as our friends you know

139
00:09:11,85 --> 00:09:16,14
and i mean that's really hard for people
who don't personally know the addicts like

140
00:09:16,14 --> 00:09:18,69
you just walk past people
outside the rainbow say

141
00:09:18,69 --> 00:09:22,82
and see some you know skunky
person it's really hard.

142
00:09:22,85 --> 00:09:25,81
It's really easy to sort
of vilify them then. And.

143
00:09:26,31 --> 00:09:31,49
And things get hyped up to you know people
sit around in groups talking about the

144
00:09:31,49 --> 00:09:34,33
problem. And they'd say you know
something's got to be done about it.

145
00:09:34,40 --> 00:09:36,19
Something's got to be done
about it but i mean that's.

146
00:09:36,75 --> 00:09:41,03
Basically just prompt some kind of
vigilante action rather than any kind of

147
00:09:41,03 --> 00:09:44,93
positive solution.

148
00:09:44,95 --> 00:09:51,26
Or a speck of drug problem.

149
00:09:51,31 --> 00:09:57,36
So well i think i think i think part of the
reason it's visible is because i don't

150
00:09:57,36 --> 00:10:01,54
think women's drug problem is necessarily
worse. Then that a lot of other places.

151
00:10:01,81 --> 00:10:04,83
I think it's probably better than a lot of
i we've got friends who have moved here

152
00:10:04,83 --> 00:10:08,99
from darlinghurst who can't believe the
furore about the drug problem because i

153
00:10:08,99 --> 00:10:13,95
think this is heaven compared to what
they moved out of in darlinghurst.

154
00:10:13,96 --> 00:10:19,07
I think the drug you know.
The problems with addiction.

155
00:10:19,35 --> 00:10:21,95
Everywhere i think one of
the things about nimbin

156
00:10:21,95 --> 00:10:23,45
and one of the healthy
things about an imminent

157
00:10:23,45 --> 00:10:27,48
that it's not it's not kept behind
closed doors and swept under the carpet.

158
00:10:27,82 --> 00:10:29,72
It's basically.

159
00:10:29,74 --> 00:10:35,40
Pretty much up front and it's pretty
pretty discussed on a community level

160
00:10:35,40 --> 00:10:40,27
and it's tried a lot of people try
to address it on this level and

161
00:10:40,27 --> 00:10:43,93
that there's a lot of people within the
community trying to do something positive

162
00:10:43,94 --> 00:10:49,24
about it. And so.

163
00:10:50,67 --> 00:10:53,38
Yeah probably seems a lot worse
than it is and like i said before

164
00:10:53,38 --> 00:10:59,20
that the drug problem in
indonesia is basically just.

165
00:11:00,38 --> 00:11:06,51
A label an over simplified label of for
a lot of other problems i mean for

166
00:11:06,52 --> 00:11:13,08
homelessness for teenage runaways for
alcoholism for poverty through all these

167
00:11:13,08 --> 00:11:14,36
sorts of things. I mean people.

168
00:11:15,88 --> 00:11:19,64
I mean all those problems come under the
label of the drug problem in most people's

169
00:11:19,64 --> 00:11:25,41
minds who are observing it
and. We're small country town.

170
00:11:26,09 --> 00:11:32,35
With one street. It's very visible.
I mean it's it's very visible and.

171
00:11:33,00 --> 00:11:35,82
What is visible is just young people.

172
00:11:36,32 --> 00:11:38,29
Sitting around outside
a rainbow and whether

173
00:11:38,29 --> 00:11:40,53
or not they in fact have a
drug problem is in there

174
00:11:40,53 --> 00:11:43,92
and they may well just the
people who are drinking.

175
00:11:44,58 --> 00:11:48,75
For awhile i mean those people go
through problems drug and alcohol use.

176
00:11:48,76 --> 00:11:51,21
You know between the age
of 18 and twenty two.

177
00:11:51,23 --> 00:11:54,92
There may be kids who are just doing
that really normal thing again.

178
00:11:54,95 --> 00:11:59,38
They're doing it. Visibly. You know they
may just as easily just be you know.

179
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,79
15 year olds who don't want to go to school
just sitting around hanging out trying

180
00:12:03,79 --> 00:12:07,10
to scare people. You know just
looking groovy having fun

181
00:12:07,10 --> 00:12:10,44
and there's also this interest i
think that it's in it's in there.

182
00:12:11,38 --> 00:12:16,37
I think the certain vested interest that
it's in their. To their advantage to.

183
00:12:17,07 --> 00:12:22,82
To clean up the town so that they're their
businesses or properties or whatever

184
00:12:22,82 --> 00:12:23,17
that

185
00:12:23,17 --> 00:12:27,68
that they're trying to sell to sort of
reasonably affluent middle class people with

186
00:12:27,68 --> 00:12:32,86
which you will do in various
people i mean they will sell land

187
00:12:32,86 --> 00:12:37,44
or services or goods to them.

188
00:12:38,20 --> 00:12:41,93
They want the town cleaned up because i
think these people scare them will scare

189
00:12:41,93 --> 00:12:44,80
these people away and and i think

190
00:12:44,80 --> 00:12:50,12
that there's these people whose allusions
like i've heard allusions about the myth

191
00:12:50,12 --> 00:12:53,60
of nimbin have been
shattered by the reality.

192
00:12:53,62 --> 00:12:57,57
They've got a vivid vested interest in
their illusions they want to find somebody

193
00:12:57,57 --> 00:13:02,60
to blame all their dream didn't come true
and i mean all these people got there.

194
00:13:02,62 --> 00:13:08,81
If this interests in beating up this
hype about the drug problem in nimbin

195
00:13:08,81 --> 00:13:13,47
and really like i don't think it's
any worse than anywhere else.

196
00:13:13,85 --> 00:13:20,67
I think it's probably a lot healthier than
other places because because like i said

197
00:13:20,67 --> 00:13:25,40
on a lot of because it is it is upfront
and and it is being talked about

198
00:13:25,40 --> 00:13:27,75
and people are trying to find solutions

199
00:13:27,75 --> 00:13:34,10
and it's i mean i mean what i was thinking
then you know like i think the person

200
00:13:34,10 --> 00:13:34,63
was really offended

201
00:13:34,63 --> 00:13:38,80
when he was asked if he wanted to
find out more king down the street.

202
00:13:40,51 --> 00:13:44,89
And they perceive these people to be sort
of really kind of system drug addicts

203
00:13:44,89 --> 00:13:51,26
and. I think a difference. You
know. Between kids using bits the.

204
00:13:51,28 --> 00:13:56,57
Getting a bit here and the way we all sat
around 20 years ago getting really quite.

205
00:13:56,88 --> 00:13:59,93
Based on smoking dope. I
mean is that acceptable is.

206
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,57
Acceptable to sort of sit in the
main street really style and

207
00:14:03,57 --> 00:14:06,82
and quite comatose on smoking dope

208
00:14:06,82 --> 00:14:10,83
but not on other drugs like i think that's
one of the hardest things about nimbin

209
00:14:10,83 --> 00:14:15,83
is that there's this drug specificity that
it's okay to smoke smoking dope still

210
00:14:16,68 --> 00:14:18,96
and to me that it's held
us back as a community.

211
00:14:19,09 --> 00:14:22,77
It's held us back in terms of what
people are cheap in the community.

212
00:14:22,81 --> 00:14:24,38
I mean this is very much
protestant work ethic

213
00:14:24,38 --> 00:14:29,04
but you know look if you're sitting around
smoking don't you don't do as much you

214
00:14:29,04 --> 00:14:31,40
don't you don't have the most
wonderful guns in the world.

215
00:14:31,54 --> 00:14:34,11
Maybe you don't sort of be
as creative or whatever

216
00:14:34,11 --> 00:14:36,56
but to me a drug is a drug is a drug

217
00:14:36,56 --> 00:14:41,25
and there's just as many problems with
people sitting around smoking dope as there

218
00:14:41,25 --> 00:14:42,77
are you know we drunks.

219
00:14:43,39 --> 00:14:47,24
Beating up on people always you know people
sticking needles and there are these

220
00:14:47,24 --> 00:14:49,28
and i mean there's this
there's this sort of.

221
00:14:50,50 --> 00:14:55,03
Acceptability about drugs that you know
it's it's okay to sit on the street

222
00:14:55,03 --> 00:15:01,09
or to sit somewhere smoking dope and
it's not okay to use the other drugs

223
00:15:01,09 --> 00:15:01,70
and i find

224
00:15:01,70 --> 00:15:05,87
that really senses the bottom line is
always people have got their own barrow to

225
00:15:05,87 --> 00:15:07,23
push and the people

226
00:15:08,26 --> 00:15:13,11
and the people who get vilified of the most
power powerless people in the community.

227
00:15:13,13 --> 00:15:18,03
Basically the young homeless kids.

228
00:15:18,05 --> 00:15:24,61
The the addicts the psych patients who are
being kicked out of their halfway houses

229
00:15:24,61 --> 00:15:26,15
these are the people.

230
00:15:26,17 --> 00:15:28,24
These are people that are always problems

231
00:15:28,24 --> 00:15:33,20
that everywheres got their
blame for some reason

232
00:15:33,20 --> 00:15:35,92
and in people's mind it
makes it all very simple

233
00:15:35,92 --> 00:15:41,01
and easy if we can just blame everything
on these sort of outlandish out of looking

234
00:15:41,01 --> 00:15:42,05
scruffy people.

235
00:15:42,31 --> 00:15:45,54
I'm doing just get rid of them and
then everything will be okay and

236
00:15:46,78 --> 00:15:51,49
and the people sitting around getting drunk
in the pub think oh you know it's all

237
00:15:51,49 --> 00:15:53,96
their problem and if we go out
and beat up a couple of them

238
00:15:53,96 --> 00:15:59,58
and teach them a lesson you know everything
will be okay and. You know it's just.

239
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,28
So why is just so wide off the mark.

240
00:16:03,44 --> 00:16:09,92
Yet this this simplistic
this simplistic sort of.

241
00:16:09,94 --> 00:16:16,02
Vigilante sort of philosophies has pushed
as a wave of solving always problems all

242
00:16:16,02 --> 00:16:20,81
these problems. Funny because i mean in
many ways nimbin was about being marginal.

243
00:16:21,04 --> 00:16:26,19
I mean 20 years ago we were we
were all very marginalised.

244
00:16:26,39 --> 00:16:29,51
You know by a to choose and
ideologies of the time

245
00:16:29,51 --> 00:16:33,00
and you know as i said
before fashions change and.

246
00:16:33,66 --> 00:16:37,84
And i guess we grow older and
and. The marginal become.

247
00:16:39,10 --> 00:16:42,42
You know more offensive
to us in many ways.

248
00:16:42,44 --> 00:16:47,81
You know i still i guess i don't like
picking up hitchhikers because they smell.

249
00:16:48,57 --> 00:16:52,52
You know like i reckon people can
always have a birdbath or whatever but.

250
00:16:52,54 --> 00:16:56,34
You know that that sort of thing
of the marginal do become.

251
00:16:56,62 --> 00:17:01,48
Stems crime yeah and we have become
the status quo and stuff like that.

252
00:17:05,70 --> 00:17:06,62
When i was using drugs.

253
00:17:06,97 --> 00:17:12,03
I used to walk in the rainforest because
i go up there to grow dope and.

254
00:17:12,04 --> 00:17:14,74
Look at you know.

255
00:17:15,15 --> 00:17:19,18
Things like huge strangler vines that
were quite extraordinary and i go.

256
00:17:19,24 --> 00:17:22,97
God i'm so lucky to live here and be
able to look at this sort of thing.

257
00:17:24,32 --> 00:17:25,83
And i could recognise that intellectually

258
00:17:25,83 --> 00:17:29,42
but i only realised after i
got clean from all drugs

259
00:17:29,42 --> 00:17:31,60
that in fact i had no
connection with that reality

260
00:17:32,53 --> 00:17:37,22
and probably the best part about living
here for me in particular living here

261
00:17:37,22 --> 00:17:41,19
totally drug free is to
look at mine violent

262
00:17:41,19 --> 00:17:42,67
and to be part of my own bind

263
00:17:44,37 --> 00:17:46,79
and in some kind of connection
with it on a spiritual level

264
00:17:46,79 --> 00:17:51,17
and i just feel a real numinous.

265
00:17:51,84 --> 00:17:55,31
Joy in that and i don't experience

266
00:17:55,31 --> 00:18:01,32
that in other places as much
as i do here. When i can walk.

267
00:18:02,33 --> 00:18:03,68
In parts of sydney and feel

268
00:18:03,68 --> 00:18:08,48
that too in parts of melbourne i mean it's
not a peculiarly country experience by

269
00:18:08,48 --> 00:18:11,68
any by any stretch. But i do feel.

270
00:18:13,63 --> 00:18:16,54
And here we go into the realms
of the arcane i do feel

271
00:18:16,54 --> 00:18:19,00
that women is is a very special spot.

272
00:18:19,32 --> 00:18:24,07
Not for the people not for for anything

273
00:18:24,07 --> 00:18:26,55
that we've done in the
last 200 years here.

274
00:18:26,97 --> 00:18:33,65
But i do feel it as one of those
places that is very magical.

275
00:18:33,92 --> 00:18:37,68
I mean it's the only word you can
describe it. Some sometimes here.

276
00:18:37,85 --> 00:18:41,16
Your heart lives up in a
really beautiful way.

277
00:18:41,49 --> 00:18:47,04
And i always get homesick for this
area and want and want to come home.

278
00:18:47,22 --> 00:18:50,47
I suppose you know any
place can become home.

279
00:18:50,49 --> 00:18:58,26
But for me this this place has
become a very special spot.

280
00:18:58,27 --> 00:19:03,14
And i guess the people to you
know like the people who stayed

281
00:19:06,58 --> 00:19:10,83
are a lot of fun. You know and people
have come and gone over the years

282
00:19:10,83 --> 00:19:13,88
and i mean they to you
know have their place here

283
00:19:14,87 --> 00:19:18,08
but for the people who came
here and decided to stay

284
00:19:18,08 --> 00:19:21,53
and have just kept on year after year.

285
00:19:22,14 --> 00:19:24,84
I mean we are a community and that

286
00:19:24,84 --> 00:19:28,93
that sense of community is is
very special also because.

287
00:19:29,83 --> 00:19:32,67
Certainly i mean i've lived in other
country towns you can walk down the street

288
00:19:32,67 --> 00:19:37,38
and you can not and say hello to everybody
but i mean we share a continuity

289
00:19:37,38 --> 00:19:41,98
and concern and continuum here that
goes back over a long time and.

290
00:19:43,80 --> 00:19:46,31
And that's a special thing to.

291
00:19:49,11 --> 00:19:49,43
I just think

292
00:19:49,43 --> 00:19:55,74
that the really really strong thing
about the community up here is the fact

293
00:19:55,74 --> 00:20:01,55
that we do really sort of cherish the
diversity of. People i mean here.

294
00:20:01,64 --> 00:20:07,36
The junkies can come. I mean by
homeless kids come. The ferals come.

295
00:20:08,52 --> 00:20:14,84
The psych patients come give me all the
you know i mean here basically all these

296
00:20:14,84 --> 00:20:19,02
people come and. And they're
taken they're taken as they are.

297
00:20:19,07 --> 00:20:22,53
I mean they're not vilified
for that they're there.

298
00:20:24,19 --> 00:20:28,03
If i me if if i get on in the community
they're accepted that there's doors open.

299
00:20:28,03 --> 00:20:31,37
I mean i can get on that
the diversity here is

300
00:20:32,99 --> 00:20:35,23
that humans is pretty much
cherished and i think.

301
00:20:36,63 --> 00:20:39,99
I think that's a fantastic thing i think.

302
00:20:40,85 --> 00:20:44,48
That's the issue that's going on at the
moment i mean the pressures in outside

303
00:20:44,48 --> 00:20:49,15
society i mean. They want to
modularize people like that.

304
00:20:49,21 --> 00:20:52,72
That's the global sort of
pressure homogenise everything.

305
00:20:52,87 --> 00:20:56,75
I mean what you've got
here is. Is incredible.

306
00:20:56,92 --> 00:21:01,71
I mean incredible range just
all sorts and mania x and

307
00:21:02,74 --> 00:21:09,24
and. And just all sorts
of people and we get on.

308
00:21:09,25 --> 00:21:11,57
I mean we do get on and.

309
00:21:12,30 --> 00:21:18,59
And the community as a whole does really
resist this pressure to homogenise in this

310
00:21:18,59 --> 00:21:20,71
this pressure to.

311
00:21:21,49 --> 00:21:26,22
To to vilify marginal people and i think
that's the strength of this community

312
00:21:26,22 --> 00:21:31,53
and that's and that's that's what a
lot of tea. I mean. A lot of the old.

313
00:21:31,81 --> 00:21:36,17
Settlers who have been
here a long time. I mean.

314
00:21:36,19 --> 00:21:42,63
That's where our strength lies in our in
our desire to preserve the diversity not

315
00:21:42,63 --> 00:21:47,57
only of the rainforests but that of
human culture and people and all

316
00:21:47,57 --> 00:21:53,13
that the different subcultures that exist
and i think that's why i mean or go on

317
00:21:53,13 --> 00:21:58,85
and that's why issues like drug addiction
will be sort of kicked about and.

318
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,65
About you know in the open and
that's why that's why when when when

319
00:22:04,65 --> 00:22:05,83
when commercial

320
00:22:05,83 --> 00:22:10,55
and economic pressures come on onto
this community to clean itself up

321
00:22:10,55 --> 00:22:13,04
and to you know rub out the messy bits

322
00:22:13,04 --> 00:22:18,94
and move them on on in the
community will push back because.

323
00:22:18,96 --> 00:22:22,52
I think i think that diversity
is where our strength lies

324
00:22:22,52 --> 00:22:26,84
and i think i think will
maintain you know against.

325
00:22:27,35 --> 00:22:33,93
Against the legal the commercial
you know the cultural pressures

326
00:22:33,93 --> 00:22:36,83
that we're bombarded with and i
think that's the strength community

327
00:22:36,83 --> 00:22:42,31
and one reason i really love here is.
