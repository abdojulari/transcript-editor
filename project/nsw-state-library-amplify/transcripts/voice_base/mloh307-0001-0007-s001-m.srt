1
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:24,4
I don't. I did for cation station seven we face. Bandler.

2
00:00:24,89 --> 00:00:27,66
And interviewed by Carolyn Craig

3
00:00:27,66 --> 00:00:34,69
and the tape will begin in a few seconds time in divide interview cation recorded in Sydney on Thursday the seventeenth

4
00:00:34,69 --> 00:00:42,42
of July nine hundred ninety seven. Take coming up in a few seconds.

5
00:00:42,44 --> 00:00:52,26
Face at the end of the last session we were in Vienna. So maybe you could continue the story from there.

6
00:00:53,58 --> 00:01:01,11
It was nice going back to Vienna for work where we had stayed for about a fortnight or more.

7
00:01:01,12 --> 00:01:05,92
It seemed for too long at first strangely primitive.

8
00:01:06,8 --> 00:01:13,69
But we allowed for that because there was very little in the country on the whole the war was just over.

9
00:01:13,71 --> 00:01:25,94
Can you imagine the city of Vienna where that coffee. And the coffee we were drinking had been sent over from. What.

10
00:01:25,96 --> 00:01:35,46
And it was well it just wasn't coffee. So it was at work.

11
00:01:36,34 --> 00:01:44,62
It was extremely primitive There was just a stream running through the came.

12
00:01:45,17 --> 00:01:52,59
The Austrian young people had been erected and we were living in that.

13
00:01:53,28 --> 00:01:58,00
But we had to do our laundry and out by here in the street.

14
00:02:01,37 --> 00:02:09,31
And the food was you know it was pretty tough because they just couldn't get food after it was so so difficult. So.

15
00:02:10,00 --> 00:02:16,31
After a bit we were all doubled into some pastors and taken back to the city of Vienna.

16
00:02:16,79 --> 00:02:27,99
The feeling was wish we could stay here for a bit low Vienna had been battered badly. Particularly the Opera House.

17
00:02:30,72 --> 00:02:44,67
I think the railway stations were bettered also heavily. But by then the trains were running in a sort of why. Anyhow.

18
00:02:45,42 --> 00:02:54,6
We were told that we could stay the night in an hour in the next day I think it was and the day after that we.

19
00:02:55,39 --> 00:02:59,08
They sent by train to.

20
00:02:59,1 --> 00:03:10,8
Well I just had one move walk through the Vinnies markets and that was where I'd have my breakfast each morning.

21
00:03:11,47 --> 00:03:23,02
Glass of milk. Had to drink something to keep a strength of a little off. And I roll and sausage.

22
00:03:23,14 --> 00:03:34,08
With the very last and so after they were in the markets they were also selling.

23
00:03:34,1 --> 00:03:44,42
So we were all over I walked through the streets of Iran and I recall go into one coffee shop that had not been there.

24
00:03:46,03 --> 00:03:57,58
And I always remember the man who owned it. He was short and fat. And he smoked his cigar in a part.

25
00:04:01,68 --> 00:04:12,96
But it was so simple you know. One could sit there is long granted and no one would. I would not dream of them.

26
00:04:14,42 --> 00:04:20,15
And coffee for support where he got it from goodness knows but it was there. Anyhow.

27
00:04:21,39 --> 00:04:35,09
And the day after I had walked the streets of Vienna. Where I bought a skirt of wool ski. His feet Affleck's. And.

28
00:04:35,11 --> 00:04:44,37
It went very well with the gold jumpers I bought in Italy and everything was so cheap so rate.

29
00:04:47,89 --> 00:04:53,85
And productive I'm sure the makers and the NE have.

30
00:04:54,07 --> 00:05:00,76
The next day we were off to Berlin and that was great excitement because you must remember that.

31
00:05:01,85 --> 00:05:06,25
This was the beginning of August that the first of August

32
00:05:07,5 --> 00:05:13,49
and we had been travelling in living out of the suitcase since the beginning of June.

33
00:05:16,08 --> 00:05:22,84
So there was great excitement and we went up to that if we were taken up to the very spot on her off

34
00:05:22,84 --> 00:05:34,71
and put it in the trains. Well I was reminded of the days of the war when. We who worked in the land me.

35
00:05:35,63 --> 00:05:42,98
Not recognised not considered service or always made to travel even where it was called the dog boxes

36
00:05:43,75 --> 00:05:51,28
and they were just too long wooden seats for the wreck over the top and we faced the other person look.

37
00:05:51,83 --> 00:05:59,08
In the other person's face as we traveled around New South Wales. Well he with his dog boxes.

38
00:06:00,62 --> 00:06:07,26
So we set off and I expected the train to get us over to have to have a damn the trip again

39
00:06:07,26 --> 00:06:13,6
and I can't remember how long. It took place last time which was only about four or five years ago.

40
00:06:14,95 --> 00:06:23,17
But it was certainly nothing like the trip that first day of August in ninety fifty one

41
00:06:24,87 --> 00:06:31,41
and we have banned all the land logged in to the train.

42
00:06:33,1 --> 00:06:41,35
And train moved so slowly I expected it to wheeze off you know thinking of Austrian German efficiency.

43
00:06:41,74 --> 00:06:44,17
Well it was sadly lacking our completely.

44
00:06:45,56 --> 00:06:53,86
And it crawled it virtually crawled across the middle of the summer and we was thirsty.

45
00:06:56,18 --> 00:07:00,95
And it was hard to get food and it was hard to get water just water to drink.

46
00:07:02,37 --> 00:07:09,99
So finally we travelled for quite some hours and I don't think we've crossed the border it.

47
00:07:10,07 --> 00:07:21,21
It never did more than say about at the very most. I reckon twenty five miles an hour if we were lucky. And.

48
00:07:21,23 --> 00:07:29,26
They knew the places the driver was told that he had us aboard there was no particular station stopped it stopped

49
00:07:29,26 --> 00:07:30,93
anywhere where there was water.

50
00:07:32,27 --> 00:07:39,68
It seemed to me and we'd get out of the train and go and drink from our hands at the tapes.

51
00:07:41,66 --> 00:07:52,06
And I have a feeling it took us from very very very early morning. Until late at night to get him to bed early.

52
00:07:53,14 --> 00:07:56,17
And I think that trip normally takes a few hours.

53
00:07:58,78 --> 00:08:03,63
I must check that but it never traveled fast it just crept along

54
00:08:05,15 --> 00:08:09,6
and then we realized there were hundreds of other trains from all.

55
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:16,52
Other countries creeping along all going to take their human cargo into belly and.

56
00:08:17,21 --> 00:08:34,51
It was an amazing thing you know the trains were coming in from Italy coming from France.

57
00:08:35,91 --> 00:08:41,36
I just can't see all of this because people there were so many people displaced after the war

58
00:08:41,36 --> 00:08:48,48
and there was tremendous movement between countries really they were all coming to the festival. How come the festival.

59
00:08:49,56 --> 00:09:04,97
Yes Oh yes. And so what. So now you must be Cali from Cali in France and coming from different places in Italy.

60
00:09:06,09 --> 00:09:14,24
Because you know when most Illini came to power he made sure the Runaways were very efficient and the stations were.

61
00:09:14,87 --> 00:09:20,47
Beautiful absolutely beautiful. And these were not actually all destroyed in the war.

62
00:09:20,81 --> 00:09:25,33
So let me tell you had very little trouble getting up there to Berlin.

63
00:09:25,91 --> 00:09:31,81
But of course you see the guts had been bombed out in Germany and pretty well out of Austria

64
00:09:32,74 --> 00:09:48,08
and so they could only move very slowly and then the trains were coming in from Moscow and Warsaw or. Budapest.

65
00:09:48,1 --> 00:09:56,14
Way from. Sofia Bulgaria and. And they were all there to Berlin.

66
00:09:56,16 --> 00:10:00,21
So you so what you got maybe outskirts of burly in we move on

67
00:10:00,21 --> 00:10:09,47
and you got to sit now you just got to sit with we exhausted. And it was very little food.

68
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:18,52
So we were hungry and we were. But the whole time. One would think. Well.

69
00:10:19,53 --> 00:10:27,42
What have we got to complain about the hundreds of thousands this train in the rubble no doubt.

70
00:10:27,43 --> 00:10:35,00
Doesn't matter if we get without food for a day or a night what does that matter. Think of how the people who suffered.

71
00:10:35,01 --> 00:10:43,13
And there was still to quieten exist in an element of hatred for the Germans among all the delegates I'm sure.

72
00:10:44,59 --> 00:10:51,5
Because there we were staring at what we had absolutely yes.

73
00:10:52,87 --> 00:11:02,48
So finally we were allowed taken into Berlin and allowed out of the train and to confront.

74
00:11:03,00 --> 00:11:16,96
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cameras because the world press was there. Well not from the West but.

75
00:11:16,97 --> 00:11:21,08
But the what thousands of people from the United States

76
00:11:21,08 --> 00:11:27,43
and the Latin American countries there with cameras waiting for these people to come in from Australia.

77
00:11:27,49 --> 00:11:34,89
I went by so only white people popping out of the train did you did.

78
00:11:35,63 --> 00:11:43,99
Oh yes and I thought that you know a stranger certainly end up paying gurus and.

79
00:11:44,01 --> 00:11:53,07
You know can I stop and turn the heater on I could remember the histories I was young and strong

80
00:11:53,07 --> 00:11:57,82
and I never worried about my caps it didn't matter at all.

81
00:11:57,95 --> 00:12:03,02
It's just grown I came through my image applied to most of the women in the delegation.

82
00:12:03,06 --> 00:12:07,82
So there was no fuss and there was no television so we had nothing to worry about.

83
00:12:11,07 --> 00:12:29,87
And then we were taken to another school where we. See schools were built. They were given a very high priority.

84
00:12:30,88 --> 00:12:31,5
After the war.

85
00:12:31,51 --> 00:12:41,93
It seemed to me anyhow in Austria and Germany and we were housed in I think the school creation some of that most

86
00:12:41,93 --> 00:12:44,84
or so we were housed in the schools all the delegates.

87
00:12:45,33 --> 00:12:47,62
Most of them were housed in the schools

88
00:12:48,44 --> 00:12:54,55
and this was of course in East Berlin in East Berlin yes because I was just going to ask you what your response was

89
00:12:54,55 --> 00:12:59,26
when you first saw the war. But the war wasn't the thing.

90
00:12:59,28 --> 00:13:06,07
The war wasn't there until a few years after that quite a few actually but the next morning.

91
00:13:07,86 --> 00:13:14,65
Someone came one of the German people who were looking after us came and said there is a woman here to meet you face

92
00:13:14,66 --> 00:13:17,83
and she wants to take you away to have some coffee.

93
00:13:19,41 --> 00:13:30,65
I had been corresponding with an anthropologist from about university you to phone. By the name of.

94
00:13:30,67 --> 00:13:37,81
So and it was wonderful to meet this woman who knew Packer responded.

95
00:13:39,58 --> 00:13:52,72
And she said Well come and see what the results of come see the results of. And I did I had a fair bit of German then.

96
00:13:53,26 --> 00:13:57,11
And her English was quite good actually.

97
00:13:57,5 --> 00:14:08,05
When she used to write to me always write in English so it was pretty good and. We moved through the streets.

98
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:25,51
And it was nothing. You could say no building. Lee rubble. And buildings.

99
00:14:25,53 --> 00:14:35,3
That were wrecked and theaters for the festival. Very good or bad adequate no problems. Plenty of room.

100
00:14:35,87 --> 00:14:42,48
And many of the stages in the you own to the Linden were set in the street.

101
00:14:42,55 --> 00:14:54,74
What was one of the great buildings they were opening a state yes and I can recall it must be in about a third fourth.

102
00:14:55,93 --> 00:15:02,16
And we were participating in a conference in a concert an open air concert

103
00:15:02,16 --> 00:15:09,78
and I said look there are fastens of Germans who want to hear the concerts and it's famous we want to give them a go.

104
00:15:09,79 --> 00:15:14,89
So we'll have to open concerts and that we're just platform.

105
00:15:14,93 --> 00:15:29,47
Nothing else just a huge platform and I can recall if you play me singing to these Germans in German.

106
00:15:30,22 --> 00:15:48,82
Still did in our car or can recall that they were crazy about it. And I can recall. Margaret focus saying to me after.

107
00:15:48,84 --> 00:16:02,8
She said You should really sing there is a preacher. And I think singing. Let's bridge collection. You know Myra.

108
00:16:02,82 --> 00:16:15,52
Lullaby. There are four or five. Them and I had already been singing that. Are saying if you just went.

109
00:16:15,68 --> 00:16:18,57
They'd never heard anything like it much less so

110
00:16:18,57 --> 00:16:25,69
but a black person singing in German to the mother I could only vote and it is just you know I think of that

111
00:16:25,69 --> 00:16:38,1
and I think my God The world has shrunk since then. Anyhow took me around it went and had coffee.

112
00:16:38,12 --> 00:16:49,27
And she had her little son who would be coming up sixteen can hardly believe it. So.

113
00:16:49,83 --> 00:17:00,03
Face would you like to just continue. So I was in Berlin for the festival lasted for two weeks.

114
00:17:00,73 --> 00:17:17,04
There were magnificent performances like to see who was the star of the Bolshoi ballet performance one like amidst this

115
00:17:17,04 --> 00:17:36,87
city and for all. And a whole. Never forget you know. I didn't take a human being could. It was because. And of course.

116
00:17:38,09 --> 00:17:48,3
Singers musicians. And when the good pianist came from. I don't know but they were there.

117
00:17:48,32 --> 00:18:07,5
It's hard for me really to describe. How devastated. Europe was. Nothing was left. And marked. And this city.

118
00:18:07,52 --> 00:18:23,91
And also put your. When there was nothing. There was left of. The hours of early. And I thought of as the place.

119
00:18:24,64 --> 00:18:34,07
That manufactured the most beautiful China that had ever been manufactured. And the treasures you know treasures.

120
00:18:34,64 --> 00:18:44,95
Not only. The treasures that originated in Germany the treasures from throughout the whole world but there.

121
00:18:46,75 --> 00:19:01,9
And as I walked these places these roads that were one street. In the suburbs where people lived.

122
00:19:04,12 --> 00:19:09,68
It's impossible for me to really just I have to think about this and I've got to find out means

123
00:19:09,68 --> 00:19:23,07
and ways of describing my emotions at that time. It's have to believe there are just so many bodies below that.

124
00:19:23,16 --> 00:19:31,25
So we're all working hard. And it only happened four or five years before that this is incredible.

125
00:19:32,89 --> 00:19:45,79
Absolutely critical and I'm just so pleased to read the autobiography written by. The Australian journalist.

126
00:19:45,81 --> 00:19:58,63
On one of Hitler's. And had some other thing. They hadn't that I know now I would have understood that situation.

127
00:19:59,63 --> 00:20:15,78
Of devastation in those two cities. I would have understood it better. And. This man. You know this is very the bone.

128
00:20:16,33 --> 00:20:30,74
Of the street. Doing a bit of painting. Was able to bring that great country. You know the country.

129
00:20:30,76 --> 00:20:38,76
I think thinking and I have said it in fact recently. When talking about the problem.

130
00:20:39,11 --> 00:20:46,74
We make little of hands that can't happen here. While you I mean who would have thought you know.

131
00:20:47,58 --> 00:20:51,02
Such tragedy could be wrote this one person.

132
00:20:52,82 --> 00:20:58,37
And he was entirely regarded I mean he was unveiled about he would say absolutely nobody wandering around the streets

133
00:20:58,37 --> 00:21:14,81
of. And then he moved a very into. The country. It gave us. Beethoven and. For us.

134
00:21:16,72 --> 00:21:23,18
And it was also responsible those German people not the Nazi party would call them the now.

135
00:21:23,85 --> 00:21:40,46
But did you have been very for not only took their own people's lives. Plus fifty million of us that one man.

136
00:21:41,31 --> 00:21:54,88
Poverty stricken. Didn't have a house to live. Lived off his friends. And so when people make little.

137
00:21:54,9 --> 00:21:58,47
I feel she was running down my spine and.

138
00:21:59,74 --> 00:22:08,54
I better not get on to that it's another thing but I look back now at that time and I think.

139
00:22:10,23 --> 00:22:19,54
As much about the beginning. Perhaps I would have understood it better. And we thought of the concentration camps.

140
00:22:19,62 --> 00:22:29,86
The big concentration camps but the what hundreds of concentration camps throughout our history. And Germany.

141
00:22:34,04 --> 00:22:42,26
And yes in many cases was brought about by. Lifting heavy stones and walking up.

142
00:22:42,28 --> 00:22:51,09
Until it dropped and pointless take the stone and take the stone. And then take it down again and take it up again.

143
00:22:52,5 --> 00:23:04,51
Until one dropped it. And so it was beautiful talking with.

144
00:23:05,35 --> 00:23:16,9
She was at the bottom university and that was where we were having most of enemy food was brought in. Brainerd sausage.

145
00:23:16,92 --> 00:23:24,00
We didn't see any greens. Unless it was a kraut.

146
00:23:24,01 --> 00:23:34,28
But I would talk to me about that terrible day and she had a brother who was actually a member of the now Tea Party

147
00:23:34,28 --> 00:23:39,4
but I can always recall her saying. Well.

148
00:23:40,83 --> 00:23:52,97
They would you know they can cover up by saying they belong to that Nazi party and to obey the laws rules orders

149
00:23:52,97 --> 00:23:54,04
and regulations.

150
00:23:54,24 --> 00:24:01,25
But she still had hundreds of thousands of Germans who didn't belong to it but they went out in the streets

151
00:24:01,25 --> 00:24:09,93
and they had same people. Well office.

152
00:24:11,56 --> 00:24:21,67
For a fortnight we were performing every night doing the dance of the little Everett which was created by.

153
00:24:22,79 --> 00:24:32,32
And on one occasion. We performed in the biggest theater. And the Soviet Union.

154
00:24:34,63 --> 00:24:41,79
Some of the Army colonels and majors just to enjoy the festival and to keep an eye on the festival

155
00:24:41,79 --> 00:24:56,52
but they were this performance one place was. And of course sitting with Frank.

156
00:24:56,54 --> 00:25:07,31
And sitting sitting next to him on either side were very high ranking army officers from that covered in bright golden

157
00:25:07,32 --> 00:25:28,26
all at and and our show. And right. Looked at them and sitting next to him this great. Streaming.

158
00:25:29,43 --> 00:25:41,37
Every time we performed the dance even though we're off to the office here and perform that. And the obvious would cry.

159
00:25:45,42 --> 00:25:47,77
After the day after that particular performance.

160
00:25:49,55 --> 00:25:57,89
I was involved in another play which my group had also created that had to do with the arrival of the convicts in

161
00:25:57,89 --> 00:26:15,53
Australia. And they were backstage. Came the. You. Flowers.

162
00:26:16,4 --> 00:26:24,91
And the flowers were being brought in from Poland for truck around especially for the festival and what they were free.

163
00:26:26,53 --> 00:26:33,11
In. It was my experience.
