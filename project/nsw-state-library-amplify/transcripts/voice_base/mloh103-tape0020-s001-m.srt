1
00:00:16,18 --> 00:00:18,89
All. Yes. Working on.

2
00:00:22,81 --> 00:00:27,25
The upside to working
in the minutia is well.

3
00:00:29,25 --> 00:00:32,87
I think each of us gets a
certain amount of kudos from.

4
00:00:33,66 --> 00:00:35,81
Being involved in the menus. I can.

5
00:00:37,00 --> 00:00:41,96
It's something we can talk about with
other people that isn't doesn't involve.

6
00:00:41,98 --> 00:00:44,56
Somebody else's life or.

7
00:00:44,58 --> 00:00:48,17
What somebody has got up to
or you know the usual gossip

8
00:00:48,17 --> 00:00:53,66
that you know mainly get into think because
there's nothing else to talk about

9
00:00:53,66 --> 00:00:54,14
that.

10
00:00:55,48 --> 00:01:01,30
Yeah something interesting to talk about
is always something happen in these and.

11
00:01:01,32 --> 00:01:07,21
Developing ideas and and
skills and all the rest of it.

12
00:01:07,23 --> 00:01:11,01
And then emmanuel's as a whole
people really do support it in.

13
00:01:12,13 --> 00:01:17,04
It's not really that hard to say
with the advertising and all

14
00:01:17,05 --> 00:01:23,15
that we are the cheapest around. That's
still the cheapest yeah for sure.

15
00:01:24,60 --> 00:01:30,57
Oh yeah well you know my. We.

16
00:01:31,26 --> 00:01:34,13
Know people you know say
i feel really good.

17
00:01:34,28 --> 00:01:40,76
You know it's depp est
one yet. They're great.

18
00:01:42,36 --> 00:01:42,88
What about you

19
00:01:43,96 --> 00:01:50,78
and room for you.

20
00:01:52,05 --> 00:01:57,35
While they've treated it like it's an
auditing which i suppose is in a way. Some.

21
00:01:57,37 --> 00:02:02,23
It is an odd place it's very
different. Oh anywhere else. It's.

22
00:02:02,24 --> 00:02:06,47
It's got so many good points to it
and it's got its bad points too.

23
00:02:06,50 --> 00:02:11,70
You know i mean people are people they're
going to be nasty sometimes and.

24
00:02:12,33 --> 00:02:14,96
But there's so many good
things happening here that.

25
00:02:16,35 --> 00:02:20,35
It's very interesting place to be i
suppose it's especially working from this

26
00:02:20,35 --> 00:02:21,81
office. It's.

27
00:02:23,47 --> 00:02:28,79
Infinitely interesting.

28
00:02:29,68 --> 00:02:30,68
What.

29
00:02:31,75 --> 00:02:38,65
I've been doing between
eight and nine years.

30
00:02:38,67 --> 00:02:45,47
Shows. Nimbin. The world is now
the place like it is there.

31
00:02:46,36 --> 00:02:50,37
I really believed. The ideals that were.

32
00:02:50,96 --> 00:02:54,42
About it about it.

33
00:02:54,43 --> 00:02:56,99
You know the peace loving brown
life and getting back to nature

34
00:02:56,99 --> 00:03:00,20
and all those sorts of things.

35
00:03:01,07 --> 00:03:05,03
That is simplistic why
i've seen them been.

36
00:03:05,63 --> 00:03:11,62
As changed for me not the same anymore.

37
00:03:11,64 --> 00:03:13,62
There's a certain amount
of disillusionment.

38
00:03:13,89 --> 00:03:17,90
As far as the human nature
part of it is concerned but.

39
00:03:19,63 --> 00:03:25,07
That's more to do is my
expectations than anything to do.

40
00:03:25,10 --> 00:03:27,84
I mean human beings have been
human beings for how long.

41
00:03:29,54 --> 00:03:33,43
I should have got the message by now and i
have you know i mean. But then i hadn't.

42
00:03:33,91 --> 00:03:37,56
And i sort of thought it was going to
be how i thought it was going to be

43
00:03:37,56 --> 00:03:43,67
but it was how it is. You know i mean.

44
00:03:44,41 --> 00:03:50,71
Prisoners are going to come and it
was it was the way it was then.

45
00:03:52,62 --> 00:03:58,71
Still happening. What they
were not. When im been.

46
00:04:01,28 --> 00:04:06,35
Nimbin there's change with there all the
stresses and strains and experiences

47
00:04:06,36 --> 00:04:10,65
that nimbleness had. It can
only really be how it's evolved

48
00:04:11,73 --> 00:04:18,25
and it's evolved into what is now certainly
hard to see what it is now that.

49
00:04:19,62 --> 00:04:21,98
Just walking around town

50
00:04:21,98 --> 00:04:26,59
and seeing a surviving little township
you know lots of people lots of people

51
00:04:26,59 --> 00:04:32,25
smiling. You realize that you
know we've all got these.

52
00:04:32,92 --> 00:04:35,55
The dark side and the
downside of life but.

53
00:04:37,33 --> 00:04:44,35
On the whole nimbin you
know quite a happy place.

54
00:04:45,22 --> 00:04:51,77
In terms of who told you why on my return.

55
00:04:52,79 --> 00:04:58,99
Why do you pick you know me you know.

56
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:01,11
I don't can't really
speak for anybody else.

57
00:05:01,50 --> 00:05:07,17
I mean i know they don't
take much notice. But.

58
00:05:07,18 --> 00:05:11,74
I think people always pick what
they don't understand and.

59
00:05:12,58 --> 00:05:15,45
Whatever new angle you're
trying to put over

60
00:05:16,30 --> 00:05:20,24
or a new thing you're trying to live is
going to be attacked from all sides because

61
00:05:20,24 --> 00:05:23,29
it's a threat to the given water.

62
00:05:23,31 --> 00:05:29,22
Whatever's existing for everybody else
out there is is all they know and.

63
00:05:29,24 --> 00:05:33,76
If you tryna live something a little bit
different. It's not that much different.

64
00:05:35,70 --> 00:05:38,65
Then it's going to be attacked.

65
00:05:38,80 --> 00:05:41,33
It's going to be brought down
it's going to be misrepresented.

66
00:05:41,94 --> 00:05:47,82
It's going to be laughed at going to
be school and. It's all those things.

67
00:05:48,11 --> 00:05:52,71
It is other people's reactions to name
then it's not really anything to do with

68
00:05:52,71 --> 00:05:57,69
women. Like that and see
how you love children.

69
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,77
What's different before.

70
00:06:06,11 --> 00:06:13,22
It was different because i
just moved out of a marriage.

71
00:06:13,24 --> 00:06:16,87
So it was going to be different.
Anyway. It was very different.

72
00:06:18,27 --> 00:06:23,15
I had to try and overcome living alone.

73
00:06:23,41 --> 00:06:27,19
I mean alone really alone. Alone and.

74
00:06:29,40 --> 00:06:35,85
Not having next door neighbours
so much and stuff like that. And.

75
00:06:35,86 --> 00:06:39,45
I decided i can't.

76
00:06:39,47 --> 00:06:45,20
Yeah i think libyans are very very social
beings i like a little be a balance

77
00:06:45,20 --> 00:06:47,18
and balance isn't one.

78
00:06:48,26 --> 00:06:51,35
I don't think maybe that's something
i still got to learn but it hasn't.

79
00:06:53,05 --> 00:06:54,26
I haven't accomplished it yet.

80
00:06:56,06 --> 00:07:00,63
So.

81
00:07:02,51 --> 00:07:05,05
Yeah yeah. The isolation.

82
00:07:05,07 --> 00:07:10,96
All the difficulties were really i mean
at that stage i think i wasn't so tired

83
00:07:11,91 --> 00:07:14,75
that stage all the difficulties were.

84
00:07:14,77 --> 00:07:20,49
Pounced on with glee if you like you
know the tics and leeches ha ha ha.

85
00:07:20,50 --> 00:07:22,61
You know i hear his take.

86
00:07:22,79 --> 00:07:27,99
I have you know you sort of
think it's a big game and.

87
00:07:28,70 --> 00:07:33,11
And this just shows how.

88
00:07:33,97 --> 00:07:37,64
How you roughing it and you know
they're all that sort of stuff.

89
00:07:39,39 --> 00:07:45,56
Now ticks a nuisance.
And you know. The hype.

90
00:07:45,69 --> 00:07:48,60
Yeah well it was i mean i
can't speak for anybody else.

91
00:07:48,74 --> 00:07:54,71
I mean maybe other people had a different
expectations and ideas that are.

92
00:07:55,95 --> 00:07:59,21
There. When i have to
stop this and how i can.

93
00:08:02,24 --> 00:08:04,75
I. Right.

94
00:08:06,37 --> 00:08:12,71
Where i'll be great. T.a.

95
00:08:13,47 --> 00:08:19,50
Just won t. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:08:19,97 --> 00:08:21,34
I'm glad to see you

97
00:08:21,34 --> 00:08:26,47
and i came to the area a month after
the aquarius festival came to nimbin

98
00:08:27,33 --> 00:08:33,74
and lived around nimbin in many
places for three years and.

99
00:08:33,76 --> 00:08:37,56
And then became body farm came
part of body farm when it started.

100
00:08:39,40 --> 00:08:42,22
In we moved to 1977.

101
00:08:42,24 --> 00:08:43,53
And the reason

102
00:08:43,53 --> 00:08:50,46
that we got this place was because of
the meditation centre up the road which

103
00:08:50,46 --> 00:08:56,15
many of us had helped to build and found
and we wanted very much to be close to

104
00:08:56,15 --> 00:08:58,99
that at that time we felt that.

105
00:09:00,20 --> 00:09:03,55
Meditation practice was a really
important part of all of our lives

106
00:09:05,34 --> 00:09:09,08
and yet we wanted to raise
families and so on.

107
00:09:09,19 --> 00:09:14,92
So we thought we'd have a
sort of like community.

108
00:09:15,89 --> 00:09:18,83
Yeah yeah. Yes.

109
00:09:20,92 --> 00:09:27,90
Well many others had lived in
india travelled in the east.

110
00:09:27,92 --> 00:09:33,11
Some of the people who formed this community
had virtually come directly from india

111
00:09:33,11 --> 00:09:38,61
and in fact came to the area because of
christopher titmus who gave the first

112
00:09:38,61 --> 00:09:41,00
retreated the meditation centre and

113
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:43,96
that was really their main
interest in our lives at

114
00:09:43,96 --> 00:09:48,78
that time my very most
important thing. So.

115
00:09:48,80 --> 00:09:53,85
We'd all had a lot of experience in
buddhist practice and just wanted to share

116
00:09:53,85 --> 00:09:59,83
that in mutual support in that practice
was what we felt we could have here.

117
00:10:01,53 --> 00:10:08,04
Just got. Describing body farm.

118
00:10:09,01 --> 00:10:11,87
It's a hundred and fifty acres.

119
00:10:11,89 --> 00:10:15,68
Much of which is at a 45 degree

120
00:10:15,68 --> 00:10:18,94
or greater angle with lots of forest

121
00:10:18,94 --> 00:10:23,21
and we came here the trees the
regrowth was about 25 years old.

122
00:10:23,26 --> 00:10:25,81
The trees continue to
grow taller and taller.

123
00:10:27,32 --> 00:10:33,87
We have very little cleared land really
just enough for tubes and gardens.

124
00:10:33,88 --> 00:10:40,66
And we've got about 13
dwellings going along to two

125
00:10:40,67 --> 00:10:43,99
little roads.

126
00:10:44,01 --> 00:10:48,53
Most couples are single people
have their own shelters.

127
00:10:48,77 --> 00:10:53,04
There's some arrangements where
various facilities is shared.

128
00:10:53,35 --> 00:10:57,05
I i have a sort of exploding house

129
00:10:57,05 --> 00:11:02,35
that i share with my present
husband my son his two sons

130
00:11:02,35 --> 00:11:04,95
and another woman and her daughter.

131
00:11:04,99 --> 00:11:07,58
So there's lots of different
living arrangements

132
00:11:08,71 --> 00:11:13,27
and then we have this wonderful large
community centre which we built together some

133
00:11:13,27 --> 00:11:18,15
years ago where we get together for
dinner cage nally and have parties

134
00:11:18,15 --> 00:11:20,57
and meetings play together here.

135
00:11:22,16 --> 00:11:25,63
I can't quite see nimbin
it's hidden by the hills

136
00:11:25,63 --> 00:11:30,61
but it's really very close
as the club crow flies.

137
00:11:31,80 --> 00:11:38,05
There's a lovely tangible creek down
the bottom of our property and.

138
00:11:38,89 --> 00:11:43,78
We've got another community on
one side as our neighbours and.

139
00:11:45,00 --> 00:11:49,53
So sort of commercial
operation on the other.

140
00:11:49,55 --> 00:11:56,15
To. Yes.

141
00:11:57,13 --> 00:11:59,85
There wasn't a single shelter
here there's a bit of us.

142
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,09
Law from some house where
they've been changed to bits

143
00:12:03,09 --> 00:12:07,43
and taken away.

144
00:12:07,45 --> 00:12:09,97
I lived with my partner at

145
00:12:09,97 --> 00:12:16,92
that time you know 15 foot caravan
americans who lived in a tent down the

146
00:12:16,92 --> 00:12:19,00
road.

147
00:12:19,90 --> 00:12:22,22
There were two other guys i guess
they must have been intense

148
00:12:22,22 --> 00:12:24,77
that was about it at the beginning
there was about four of us

149
00:12:25,55 --> 00:12:28,36
and we just rated where how to build
a shelter where we could cook

150
00:12:28,36 --> 00:12:30,54
and stuff so we did

151
00:12:30,54 --> 00:12:37,06
that in a very piecemeal way none none
of us had virtually any experience in

152
00:12:37,06 --> 00:12:42,60
building and being very sort
of idealistic about making it.

153
00:12:42,61 --> 00:12:46,85
Our own way we had no power tools
we did all our buildings by hand.

154
00:12:46,94 --> 00:12:53,19
Everything by hand lot of work and a lot
of learning which is quite fantastic

155
00:12:53,19 --> 00:12:59,27
that we took that on we
had no water. No nothing.

156
00:13:01,37 --> 00:13:07,23
And. It's interesting that in the first
year just heaps of people flocked here.

157
00:13:07,45 --> 00:13:10,08
I think by the time we were two years old.

158
00:13:10,08 --> 00:13:14,12
We had 30 people staying here under
the most difficult conditions

159
00:13:14,12 --> 00:13:18,12
and a tiny tiny community space
in which we a together every day.

160
00:13:22,16 --> 00:13:25,86
And we had eight babies in the first year.

161
00:13:26,57 --> 00:13:29,52
Eight babies in tents mine
was born in the caravan

162
00:13:29,52 --> 00:13:33,23
and so we were busy having babies

163
00:13:33,23 --> 00:13:37,86
and building our very basic
houses at the same time.

164
00:13:37,88 --> 00:13:41,06
It was quite it was quite
stressful and quite challenging

165
00:13:41,06 --> 00:13:49,81
and we had a tremendous sense
of helping each other.

166
00:13:51,20 --> 00:13:57,04
People were drawn because they i mean
immediately had a reputation as a spiritual

167
00:13:57,04 --> 00:14:00,22
community which can work both. Ways.

168
00:14:01,90 --> 00:14:05,59
People can say very nice things about
you know very scathing things about you

169
00:14:06,50 --> 00:14:09,93
and we've had plenty of both.
And i'm sure we've deserved.

170
00:14:10,04 --> 00:14:15,60
You know if you if you set yourself up
to have a lot of ideals your really good

171
00:14:15,60 --> 00:14:19,75
target. But yes a lot of those
people were really interested in.

172
00:14:21,92 --> 00:14:25,61
In meditation practice or buddhism
or you know something like

173
00:14:25,61 --> 00:14:28,03
that was what drew them here.

174
00:14:28,05 --> 00:14:33,48
I think that we were very lucky and that
the people who began this community.

175
00:14:33,49 --> 00:14:35,58
It was like a good chemical mixture.

176
00:14:35,84 --> 00:14:39,27
It worked and there was really
very little conflict and

177
00:14:39,27 --> 00:14:44,33
that attracted people as well as.

178
00:14:46,37 --> 00:14:48,94
Well.

179
00:14:49,69 --> 00:14:51,24
I'd say we experimented with

180
00:14:51,24 --> 00:14:57,57
or inquired into the basic buddhist
precepts which involve killing

181
00:14:57,58 --> 00:15:04,38
stealing issue of what's called false
speech false speech which is truly trying

182
00:15:04,38 --> 00:15:09,83
to be as truthful as possible.

183
00:15:09,85 --> 00:15:14,34
Not taking intoxicants which
was never totally strict

184
00:15:14,34 --> 00:15:18,46
but was quite strict early
on things like that

185
00:15:18,46 --> 00:15:24,89
and we also expected everyone
to do a retreat every year and

186
00:15:24,89 --> 00:15:26,60
that if someone wanted
to join the community

187
00:15:26,60 --> 00:15:28,47
that they really needed to know what

188
00:15:28,47 --> 00:15:35,62
that was about to do a
retreat was important.

189
00:15:35,64 --> 00:15:40,88
We know early on did we by
many other teachers around

190
00:15:40,88 --> 00:15:47,61
but in the later years we've had some
wonderful spiritual teachers come here

191
00:15:48,79 --> 00:15:53,64
like teach not hahn whose vietnam era.

192
00:15:53,66 --> 00:15:59,49
The man who we built the meditation centre
forward teach in comes back he was here

193
00:15:59,49 --> 00:16:00,74
again. It's here. Christopher.

194
00:16:01,80 --> 00:16:05,60
So we have a very much an
ongoing relationship with him.

195
00:16:06,75 --> 00:16:12,01
We've organized we treat them like
bakker who's sort of in the lineage of

196
00:16:12,01 --> 00:16:12,84
krishnamurti

197
00:16:14,36 --> 00:16:17,87
and numerous other be
passionate teachers so

198
00:16:21,39 --> 00:16:23,40
that was very very obvious
at the beginning.

199
00:16:23,63 --> 00:16:25,77
It's not like when you're
not unique in that

200
00:16:25,77 --> 00:16:30,83
and under cross the ridge also has
a very strong orientation towards

201
00:16:31,82 --> 00:16:35,86
but a spiritual practice to. Did.

202
00:16:38,04 --> 00:16:43,63
Exist.

203
00:16:44,38 --> 00:16:47,59
Yeah it was quite strict i mean when you.

204
00:16:48,27 --> 00:16:53,69
So many of us first met these ideas
in india or nepal some place like

205
00:16:53,69 --> 00:16:59,31
that in the idea what does it mean
not to hire any living thing.

206
00:16:59,62 --> 00:17:01,05
Well virtually that's impossible.

207
00:17:01,51 --> 00:17:07,10
But yes i mean in the beginning we
didn't kill mosquitoes which bitters and

208
00:17:07,10 --> 00:17:12,44
when blowflies bitters nuttall of those
much flies bit us. We didn't kill them.

209
00:17:12,53 --> 00:17:15,64
We simply tried to rattle their brains.

210
00:17:15,77 --> 00:17:18,68
You know hands so they
didn't travel us too much

211
00:17:18,68 --> 00:17:24,47
and i mean it's easy to be
cynical or scoff at that now

212
00:17:24,47 --> 00:17:27,68
but it's really quite
interesting to play with ideas

213
00:17:27,68 --> 00:17:31,71
and see how far you can go with that and.

214
00:17:32,47 --> 00:17:35,02
And that's true with that
looking at all those precepts

215
00:17:35,02 --> 00:17:39,58
and i think what we came
to within a few years was

216
00:17:39,58 --> 00:17:45,66
that there's no actual action or non
action that has to be adhered to.

217
00:17:45,87 --> 00:17:49,55
But that your conscious all the time
of what you're doing and more and more

218
00:17:49,55 --> 00:17:56,42
that i think become our shared
inquiry is to really be willing to

219
00:17:56,42 --> 00:17:59,64
just say ok well is this.

220
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,22
Really something i want to do and and

221
00:18:02,22 --> 00:18:05,80
when i kill this creature am i
aware of it is it necessary.

222
00:18:05,86 --> 00:18:09,35
Is it you know just really
thinking about what we do

223
00:18:09,35 --> 00:18:15,43
and our lives.

224
00:18:15,45 --> 00:18:19,85
Yeah yeah that's a bill
miller thacker uses

225
00:18:19,85 --> 00:18:25,29
that word into instead of meditation
and i think everybody here would agree

226
00:18:25,29 --> 00:18:31,48
that that's what we're that's what you know
insists is a dedication to inquiry for

227
00:18:31,48 --> 00:18:34,19
ourselves and to share
that and to acknowledge

228
00:18:34,19 --> 00:18:37,71
that it's a bit different for everybody
but it's really good to share it and

229
00:18:37,71 --> 00:18:54,08
and how they other people reflect back to
you how they feel about your inquiry to.

230
00:18:54,89 --> 00:18:58,96
Yeah i know one of our main
claims to fame and i must say

231
00:18:58,96 --> 00:19:04,16
that being attacked by the
government even on the local level.

232
00:19:04,35 --> 00:19:09,87
It's like an outside threat is a wonderful
thing to unite a community and.

233
00:19:11,14 --> 00:19:16,17
My memory may not be as clear as
some other people here on that but

234
00:19:17,39 --> 00:19:22,13
when the fight for the train you
creek rain for asd came to a head.

235
00:19:22,43 --> 00:19:27,27
Chris bodey farmers many other places around
were deserted everyone was down there

236
00:19:28,23 --> 00:19:31,19
and the local community.

237
00:19:31,21 --> 00:19:36,38
In some ways took that struggle
as a real affront to something

238
00:19:36,38 --> 00:19:39,22
that they thought was theirs and.

239
00:19:39,24 --> 00:19:44,67
It was only at that stage that the
local council said hey wait a minute.

240
00:19:44,67 --> 00:19:47,28
You never asked for permission
to build on this land.

241
00:19:47,62 --> 00:19:48,75
We've never even heard of you.

242
00:19:48,85 --> 00:19:52,07
I mean they had to have known we were
doing what we're doing but that was.

243
00:19:52,48 --> 00:19:56,38
They just had had enough
with their troublemaking

244
00:19:56,38 --> 00:20:02,32
and suddenly said you can't do. That.

245
00:20:02,34 --> 00:20:06,97
And the whole movement for multiple
occupancy sort of sprang from

246
00:20:06,97 --> 00:20:09,66
that conflict.

247
00:20:09,68 --> 00:20:13,22
And a lot of people who were
very active in that movement

248
00:20:13,22 --> 00:20:17,05
and in the what it ended up ended
up happening with bertie farm was

249
00:20:17,05 --> 00:20:24,58
that we had demolition demolition orders put
on two of our houses primarily because.

250
00:20:25,32 --> 00:20:30,10
They didn't have four walls
they had three walls.

251
00:20:31,13 --> 00:20:31,22
Before

252
00:20:31,23 --> 00:20:35,30
that there was a lot of question of whether
we had the right to their building

253
00:20:35,30 --> 00:20:39,29
standards weren't good
enough and sydney uni

254
00:20:39,29 --> 00:20:43,30
and all kinds of people got involved
with testing the strength of our timbers

255
00:20:43,30 --> 00:20:44,11
and years found out

256
00:20:44,11 --> 00:20:49,25
that ron brown polls are ever so much
stronger than a similar sickness of square

257
00:20:49,25 --> 00:20:53,24
poles and so on but in the end
we had a demolition order

258
00:20:53,24 --> 00:20:57,48
and two houses for five years
which eventually went the land

259
00:20:57,48 --> 00:21:04,28
and environment court and. We are
all really enjoyed the hearing.

260
00:21:04,30 --> 00:21:07,39
Whatever you call it that happened.

261
00:21:08,32 --> 00:21:11,42
One of those houses was mine and and.

262
00:21:13,25 --> 00:21:17,94
I look back now and i i would feel the
same way if it was done over again.

263
00:21:18,00 --> 00:21:21,44
I can remember saying to my partner. Well.

264
00:21:21,46 --> 00:21:25,97
Let's build the bleachers for the audience
to watch this place being bulldozed you

265
00:21:25,97 --> 00:21:30,00
know how fantastic because
in fact when we all

266
00:21:30,01 --> 00:21:35,80
when all of us first built here are a very
important idea to us was to do minimally

267
00:21:35,80 --> 00:21:41,82
and to create something where we wouldn't
be too tied up into material possessions

268
00:21:41,82 --> 00:21:45,10
that our house wasn't didn't
take a huge investment of time

269
00:21:45,10 --> 00:21:47,63
and money in therefore you
have to worry about it

270
00:21:47,63 --> 00:21:49,87
and that's in the spirit
which we approached

271
00:21:49,87 --> 00:21:54,40
that conflict was not being
terribly worried if we lost

272
00:21:54,40 --> 00:21:59,87
that it would be quite a good bit
of theatre and quite a statement.

273
00:22:00,72 --> 00:22:04,59
But in fact it did you
nineties and we learnt a lot

274
00:22:04,59 --> 00:22:08,92
and we became very involved
in the community because of

275
00:22:08,92 --> 00:22:15,51
that. Yeah yeah.

276
00:22:15,54 --> 00:22:21,51
When is a room not a room. Yeah and i
mean they're the questions that the.

277
00:22:22,30 --> 00:22:27,44
The council q.c.. Put was you know.
Well i mean this is terrible.

278
00:22:27,59 --> 00:22:34,07
What about the welfare of children
vermin snakes coming in our queues see

279
00:22:34,07 --> 00:22:38,95
question well what's sleep out for and and
there's more if it's got a television

280
00:22:38,95 --> 00:22:39,96
and a bed in it.

281
00:22:40,83 --> 00:23:01,42
And so it was very interesting some time.

282
00:23:03,51 --> 00:23:08,03
You mean men and women's
relationships. I don't know if.

283
00:23:08,40 --> 00:23:14,67
I don't think the actual physical stresses
that we underwent such as not having.

284
00:23:14,69 --> 00:23:17,85
A stove or a hot water

285
00:23:17,85 --> 00:23:24,42
or about through a place to wash nappies
really was a strain on our relationships.

286
00:23:24,43 --> 00:23:25,47
It was.

287
00:23:26,50 --> 00:23:32,07
I think a big internal strain for individuals
because it was like i mean we didn't.

288
00:23:32,34 --> 00:23:33,89
None of us grew up in communities.

289
00:23:34,92 --> 00:23:37,40
People don't in the western world

290
00:23:37,40 --> 00:23:42,06
and you have to learn all kinds of things
which you don't have to know about

291
00:23:42,06 --> 00:23:43,55
when you live in a nuclear situation.

292
00:23:45,80 --> 00:23:48,92
So in that way it is very
stressful in the fact that.

293
00:23:49,81 --> 00:23:54,91
Things that every family have to do
such as nappies is quite a huge job

294
00:23:54,91 --> 00:23:59,95
when you don't have much
to do it with. And yet.

295
00:24:00,16 --> 00:24:06,84
We had to build our houses and
cook for 30 people every day and.

296
00:24:06,86 --> 00:24:08,48
I know. Tell us. Fine.

297
00:24:08,50 --> 00:24:12,55
We had to drive the chain and
to make a phone call and all

298
00:24:12,55 --> 00:24:17,80
that sort of seeing as that's sort of
what i meant by stressful a lot of

299
00:24:20,27 --> 00:24:24,72
i'm wondering if i can say if there's any
single relationship which remained intact

300
00:24:24,72 --> 00:24:29,61
over the period of this
community which is now 15 years

301
00:24:29,61 --> 00:24:34,47
and i think no but that is not unlike.

302
00:24:36,16 --> 00:24:40,33
People are age in the wider community.

303
00:24:41,51 --> 00:24:46,96
Some of us who've established relationships
with people who are on the community.

304
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:51,42
You know like you could say people have
changed partners really not quite like

305
00:24:51,42 --> 00:24:53,58
that but.

306
00:24:54,35 --> 00:24:55,51
Yes people who've lived here

307
00:24:55,51 --> 00:25:04,15
and dissolve relationships have
made new ones with other people on.

308
00:25:04,17 --> 00:25:07,00
This. Cause.

309
00:25:07,02 --> 00:25:12,17
But that's been a common.

310
00:25:13,29 --> 00:25:16,90
Well i don't know a lot
about other communities.

311
00:25:17,66 --> 00:25:24,09
I i think they have a feeling
that we communicate really well.

312
00:25:26,76 --> 00:25:30,52
Of course there are tensions between us
people you know we see things differently

313
00:25:30,52 --> 00:25:34,25
want things to be done differently.

314
00:25:35,01 --> 00:25:41,84
But we've always managed to get through
it without a real crisis. And yes it is.

315
00:25:43,32 --> 00:25:47,78
We don't live all that close
together. Really moment to moment.

316
00:25:48,38 --> 00:25:50,53
So that's not.

317
00:25:51,24 --> 00:25:55,31
A really big problem but just like you
know i shared a house in the city

318
00:25:55,31 --> 00:25:59,94
or anything like most of the most of
the time i in fact have shared me.

319
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:04,35
I might shelter with other couples or.

320
00:26:04,36 --> 00:26:09,87
People and two people and a
child and one prisoner child.

321
00:26:11,49 --> 00:26:15,36
And yes that stressful but i
think lots of people experience.

322
00:26:15,90 --> 00:26:21,06
The stressors who don't live in communities
to students you know it's very much the

323
00:26:21,06 --> 00:26:23,99
same.

324
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:31,14
For the structures.

325
00:26:31,85 --> 00:26:38,30
Well the place was incredibly chief.
It wasn't a real hot property.

326
00:26:38,64 --> 00:26:42,47
It was coal it's cold ravished by
the locals because it's old trees

327
00:26:42,47 --> 00:26:46,24
and state so it was only
sixteen thousand dollars

328
00:26:47,30 --> 00:26:51,84
and we decided at the beginning
that they'd be $1000 shares.

329
00:26:51,92 --> 00:26:57,97
So i didn't take long for
us to pay for that. And.

330
00:26:59,57 --> 00:27:02,53
It was only after a number
of years when we realized

331
00:27:02,53 --> 00:27:03,91
that for new people joining

332
00:27:03,91 --> 00:27:09,84
that maybe the share price should go up
at the moment i think it's still under

333
00:27:09,84 --> 00:27:11,36
$4000 for a share.

334
00:27:11,51 --> 00:27:15,08
It's just very hard for
someone to get us to agree

335
00:27:15,08 --> 00:27:20,99
that they can be a shareholder
the structures that we set up.

336
00:27:21,01 --> 00:27:26,56
We set ourselves up in the cheap legally
in the cheapest way possible which was a

337
00:27:26,56 --> 00:27:29,43
company which.

338
00:27:30,61 --> 00:27:35,84
Was sort of under a voluntary association
because that's a very very cheap way of

339
00:27:35,84 --> 00:27:38,19
forming an organization much cheaper

340
00:27:38,19 --> 00:27:42,63
and simpler than a cooperative so we were
a voluntary association because those

341
00:27:42,63 --> 00:27:47,12
selves the body church churches
are voluntary associations

342
00:27:47,12 --> 00:27:53,25
and formed a company. And we have
trustees the land is held in trust.

343
00:27:53,67 --> 00:27:56,36
But what what a voluntary
association means

344
00:27:56,36 --> 00:27:59,85
that the place cannot be sold it
has to be passed on to another.

345
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,34
There's such organisation and that was
one of our big ideals was that. Ok.

346
00:28:05,74 --> 00:28:09,28
We're going to get a hold of this in
this piece of land can never be bought

347
00:28:09,28 --> 00:28:14,61
and sold again we decided

348
00:28:14,62 --> 00:28:17,62
that shares were non-refundable and

349
00:28:17,62 --> 00:28:19,88
that everything here
belonged to the communities.

350
00:28:20,09 --> 00:28:27,17
So technically speaking our houses do not
belong to us they belong to the community.

351
00:28:28,31 --> 00:28:30,77
Day to day organisation involved

352
00:28:30,77 --> 00:28:35,90
and i think we've got it down pretty
well liked in the beginning we only had

353
00:28:35,90 --> 00:28:41,04
community cars. So we had a car
system a car booking system.

354
00:28:41,06 --> 00:28:44,09
Cars had parents who looked
you know looked after them.

355
00:28:45,24 --> 00:28:48,27
One person did the food
ordering another person and

356
00:28:48,27 --> 00:28:53,77
when we did get a telephone to the telephone
bill someone else took care of the car

357
00:28:53,77 --> 00:28:59,46
books and that's all still
in place today. And that.

358
00:29:00,03 --> 00:29:01,20
Wasn't always easy

359
00:29:01,20 --> 00:29:05,51
but i think a lot of people would say we've
got really good figuring those things

360
00:29:05,51 --> 00:29:06,21
out so

361
00:29:06,21 --> 00:29:13,68
that they were we pay into a
general kitty every week.

362
00:29:13,70 --> 00:29:18,99
We save money. We decide on major
expenditures together we are operating.

363
00:29:19,47 --> 00:29:26,17
I suppose you'd say consensus
minus one. We don't vote.

364
00:29:26,18 --> 00:29:32,37
Sometimes we spend an awful lot of time
talking about things like we might talk

365
00:29:32,38 --> 00:29:36,51
when we were going to build a dam we talked
about it for about three years every

366
00:29:36,51 --> 00:29:41,21
reading and then we switched to some
other thorny subject which you know

367
00:29:41,21 --> 00:29:45,99
and sometimes i think i meetings are so
long is just because we really do like to

368
00:29:45,99 --> 00:29:48,50
talk and we.

369
00:29:49,21 --> 00:29:54,14
We're to sort of active to do it socially
so we only have meetings as excuses to

370
00:29:54,14 --> 00:29:59,31
talk for a long time for.

371
00:30:01,71 --> 00:30:07,29
You know we've just develop strategies for
dealing with the stress of it like i can

372
00:30:07,29 --> 00:30:11,91
remember early on i get headaches i'd
be shaking i'd feel exhausted in the

373
00:30:11,91 --> 00:30:14,64
irritable after meetings and.

374
00:30:14,66 --> 00:30:20,49
A lot of us with the you know where is it
not being so in it's a one community is a

375
00:30:20,49 --> 00:30:25,73
wonderful way of learning not to be so
invested in your own opinions because if you

376
00:30:25,73 --> 00:30:31,14
have a big investment over there
is just hell. I think that all.

377
00:30:32,34 --> 00:30:39,78
How much trouble you can give yourself.

378
00:30:40,93 --> 00:30:46,09
Yeah i do yeah i do think everyone
has has had to deal with that

379
00:30:46,09 --> 00:30:47,65
and has gotten a lot out of it.

380
00:30:50,37 --> 00:30:58,21
I think.

381
00:30:58,95 --> 00:31:03,04
You know i think you know i.

382
00:31:03,06 --> 00:31:09,36
When i hear about them as being
started now it's so often. Really.

383
00:31:09,38 --> 00:31:16,09
Can i clear based which i mean it's fine
it's it's i'm more obviously because i'm

384
00:31:16,09 --> 00:31:22,38
here for finding a way to live
that. Doesn't tied to sort of.

385
00:31:24,34 --> 00:31:29,57
The tyranny of working you
know you know life away.

386
00:31:29,59 --> 00:31:32,83
And. But i think same time i.

387
00:31:33,29 --> 00:31:39,60
I wonder how it is you know how hard
a time communities can have like

388
00:31:39,60 --> 00:31:41,57
that there are. Just throw up.
