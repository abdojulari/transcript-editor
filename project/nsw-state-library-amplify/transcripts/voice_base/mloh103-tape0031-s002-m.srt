1
00:00:11,21 --> 00:00:11,84
And combined with

2
00:00:11,84 --> 00:00:16,80
that resurgence of the national party's
involvement in community politics

3
00:00:16,80 --> 00:00:20,17
and the involvement of developers in them

4
00:00:20,17 --> 00:00:24,78
and there were a couple of very
controversial environmental issues

5
00:00:24,78 --> 00:00:25,52
that were occurring.

6
00:00:25,93 --> 00:00:30,82
One was where the name was going to get
a centralised sewerage scheme the name

7
00:00:30,82 --> 00:00:37,08
and village and the other was the issue
of waste disposal as we had a landfill.

8
00:00:37,10 --> 00:00:41,03
That was practically full. I think those.

9
00:00:41,58 --> 00:00:45,79
Those issues especially the surge issue
really polarized a village there were those

10
00:00:45,79 --> 00:00:49,09
people who wanted it and saw
it as the only solution

11
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:51,31
and then there were the
other people who felt

12
00:00:51,31 --> 00:00:56,59
that we really had moved past the point
of putting effluent discharge into creeks

13
00:00:56,59 --> 00:00:58,83
which is what was proposed for name and

14
00:00:58,83 --> 00:01:02,15
that we really needed to find
other malton solutions and

15
00:01:02,15 --> 00:01:03,73
that this was what niman was on about

16
00:01:04,80 --> 00:01:09,82
and in fact it really brought the whole
sort of alternative lifestyle debate if you

17
00:01:09,82 --> 00:01:13,11
like to head that if anywhere.

18
00:01:13,49 --> 00:01:16,92
If there was going to be anywhere in
australia where you would see creative

19
00:01:16,92 --> 00:01:20,55
solutions to sewage disposal then
you would expect to see it in niman

20
00:01:20,55 --> 00:01:26,66
and not expect to see the traditional
centralised treatment works with their

21
00:01:26,66 --> 00:01:30,47
courant pouring into waterways.

22
00:01:30,49 --> 00:01:33,29
The sir it's issue has now been resolved

23
00:01:33,29 --> 00:01:38,57
and women's currently seeing a centralised
surge treatment works being installed

24
00:01:38,57 --> 00:01:42,24
and pipes being laid throughout village

25
00:01:43,03 --> 00:01:46,49
but i think the process of coming
to this point has been one

26
00:01:46,49 --> 00:01:51,35
that has been incredibly divisive perhaps
one of the most controversial issues

27
00:01:51,35 --> 00:01:54,15
that the villagers had to deal
with for a very long time.

28
00:01:55,21 --> 00:01:59,96
It's an incredibly heated
debate. It's seen. Divorce.

29
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,11
Since occur in the community

30
00:02:02,11 --> 00:02:05,41
that probably never you know
didn't exist before i believe

31
00:02:05,41 --> 00:02:09,16
that we got to a point where people
were learning to live together.

32
00:02:09,18 --> 00:02:12,96
You know quite comfortably and each
had respect for the other's position

33
00:02:12,96 --> 00:02:13,89
and points of view

34
00:02:14,75 --> 00:02:19,36
but the the serious debate brought up a
whole lot of sort of underlying prejudice

35
00:02:20,33 --> 00:02:24,59
and it was particularly strong i think
because it focused on environmental issues

36
00:02:24,59 --> 00:02:27,76
and people who've moved to nim

37
00:02:27,76 --> 00:02:31,76
and over the last 20 years have always
been very strong on environmental issues

38
00:02:31,76 --> 00:02:34,97
it's something that they felt
you know passionately about

39
00:02:36,71 --> 00:02:38,67
and while i'm not saying

40
00:02:38,67 --> 00:02:41,62
that the people who lived here before
don't feel the same sort of passions in

41
00:02:41,62 --> 00:02:43,40
relation to the environment i think

42
00:02:43,40 --> 00:02:48,12
that we perhaps have different
solutions to the problems or perceive

43
00:02:48,12 --> 00:02:52,65
that there are different solutions and
the sewerage the sewage treatment works.

44
00:02:52,70 --> 00:02:55,55
You know really brought that
to a head and it's still.

45
00:02:56,23 --> 00:03:00,81
A smoldering issue even though it's
been resolved as far as council

46
00:03:01,61 --> 00:03:05,58
and people in the village are concerned
and i think we'll see the effects of

47
00:03:05,58 --> 00:03:07,15
that actually in the name

48
00:03:07,15 --> 00:03:28,08
and village for you know
quite a time to come.

49
00:03:30,39 --> 00:03:34,84
I think it's been a it's been a major
disappointment for people who were looking

50
00:03:34,84 --> 00:03:37,71
for alternative solutions
for niman i think.

51
00:03:38,07 --> 00:03:42,19
Niman was in the position of finding it
difficult to find alternative solutions

52
00:03:42,19 --> 00:03:44,44
however there were alternative solutions

53
00:03:44,44 --> 00:03:47,85
that could have been considered
the issue though was much more

54
00:03:49,12 --> 00:03:54,12
that the state government weren't prepared
to provide a subsidy for any scheme

55
00:03:54,12 --> 00:03:56,09
that wasn't a centralised scheme.

56
00:03:56,54 --> 00:03:59,89
In addition there were a
whole lot of problems right.

57
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,22
I used around the issues that.

58
00:04:01,29 --> 00:04:05,17
Well if we gave everybody their
own system in their own backyard.

59
00:04:06,65 --> 00:04:09,27
Who would own the system
council would be paying for it

60
00:04:09,27 --> 00:04:12,26
and therefore would own it but in
fact it would be on private property.

61
00:04:12,68 --> 00:04:17,41
So there were these two issues that
weren't resolved and i feel in part

62
00:04:17,41 --> 00:04:20,96
that the the state government
and local governments.

63
00:04:21,03 --> 00:04:24,89
If they've taken a more positive
attitude to onsite sewage disposal

64
00:04:24,89 --> 00:04:30,30
and said how can we do it rather than taken
the attitude well it's going to be very

65
00:04:30,30 --> 00:04:31,61
difficult not really possible

66
00:04:32,50 --> 00:04:35,36
that we would have had probably
a very different outcome.

67
00:04:36,82 --> 00:04:41,36
So it was disappointing for me because i'd
been involved in the debate for you know

68
00:04:41,36 --> 00:04:42,11
two years

69
00:04:42,11 --> 00:04:47,49
and it was disappointing for a lot
of people who weren't involved in it

70
00:04:47,49 --> 00:04:51,87
but who just saw the outcome and i think
it's it's that there's a lesson for nim

71
00:04:51,87 --> 00:04:54,90
and it really in that you
can't afford to stand back

72
00:04:54,90 --> 00:04:59,34
and wait till decisions are made
you really have to be in there

73
00:04:59,34 --> 00:05:03,10
and be involved in the process of making
decisions to have your voice heard.

74
00:05:04,16 --> 00:05:08,30
I believe that if we'd had more
import from people in the village

75
00:05:08,30 --> 00:05:11,05
and there'd been more outspoken
on the issue at the time

76
00:05:11,05 --> 00:05:14,82
and it was to be being debated in
council with the state government

77
00:05:14,82 --> 00:05:18,14
that we would possibly have got a
different outcome for the village.

78
00:05:18,33 --> 00:05:20,82
I would like to say though
that i believe that

79
00:05:20,82 --> 00:05:27,06
that struggle in niman will actually have
impact on other small rural villages

80
00:05:27,95 --> 00:05:28,66
in that i think

81
00:05:28,66 --> 00:05:33,55
that we did a lot to inform the
debate on on sites who is disposal

82
00:05:34,33 --> 00:05:35,54
and i don't believe

83
00:05:35,54 --> 00:05:41,84
that other other villages looking at what
they can do about sewerage will have to

84
00:05:42,96 --> 00:05:47,32
go through the same things that we did
and i think that the state government

85
00:05:47,32 --> 00:05:53,34
and council will be a lot more open on site
effluent disposal for other areas much

86
00:05:53,34 --> 00:05:55,14
more open than they were for nim

87
00:05:55,14 --> 00:05:58,56
and so we've had to cater to local government
we've educated the state government

88
00:05:59,47 --> 00:06:00,09
and fought. When

89
00:06:00,09 --> 00:06:23,42
that lay not in time to have a
different solution for niman.

90
00:06:23,44 --> 00:06:29,40
I often hear it said in council by
counseled women and council staff

91
00:06:29,40 --> 00:06:33,95
that nim and the very divided community.

92
00:06:33,97 --> 00:06:38,11
I actually don't see it as such a divided
community i think it's a very diverse

93
00:06:38,11 --> 00:06:44,99
community it's certainly a very complex
community to have to communicate with

94
00:06:44,99 --> 00:06:50,30
as an alderman and to try and get a
feel of what the community really wants

95
00:06:50,30 --> 00:06:57,08
or you know what they think
they really want. It's.

96
00:06:58,66 --> 00:07:00,45
It's a very difficult community to try

97
00:07:00,45 --> 00:07:05,51
and gauge the feelings of those people
who aren't involved in community

98
00:07:05,51 --> 00:07:09,81
organizations we have quite a
few community organizations in

99
00:07:11,05 --> 00:07:16,84
and the composition of those organizations
are primarily you know people who've

100
00:07:16,84 --> 00:07:21,23
lived here for a long time who've been
part of sort of traditional settlement of

101
00:07:21,23 --> 00:07:27,15
niman and people who've moved into the
area for the purpose of developing land.

102
00:07:27,28 --> 00:07:32,19
So it's extremely difficult for me to
find any forum whereby i can gauge the

103
00:07:32,19 --> 00:07:38,54
opinion of people who've settled here
since aquarius so in the last 20 years.

104
00:07:38,95 --> 00:07:42,05
The only way i can find
out how those people feel

105
00:07:42,05 --> 00:07:44,27
and i mean they're not united on any issue

106
00:07:45,09 --> 00:07:48,52
but just to get a general feeling is
to actually go out into the community

107
00:07:48,52 --> 00:07:50,58
and talk to those people or to find people

108
00:07:50,58 --> 00:07:55,20
that i would can be considered to be
some of the key people in the community.

109
00:07:55,27 --> 00:07:57,09
Who've you know got good networks

110
00:07:57,09 --> 00:07:59,50
and asked them how they
think on particular issues.

111
00:08:00,77 --> 00:08:02,73
Unfortunately i think four niman

112
00:08:02,73 --> 00:08:07,56
and four people have settled here in the
last you know 20 years post aquarius.

113
00:08:07,75 --> 00:08:12,17
They're generally those people are not
involved in community organizations

114
00:08:12,17 --> 00:08:15,70
but i think in part. They've
come here thinking that.

115
00:08:15,72 --> 00:08:19,24
You know they can get away from politics
that they don't want to be any part of

116
00:08:19,24 --> 00:08:23,92
that that therefore they don't
want to be part of a community.

117
00:08:24,35 --> 00:08:29,54
You know community groups or community
organization no matter in what form

118
00:08:29,54 --> 00:08:33,75
or shape and i think that's
you know it's to a detriment.

119
00:08:33,92 --> 00:08:40,81
In some ways because the political process
is work very much through representation

120
00:08:40,81 --> 00:08:46,50
to say local government or state
government or you know to whatever thing

121
00:08:46,50 --> 00:08:47,10
and i think

122
00:08:47,10 --> 00:08:53,64
that whilst we have people who are making
representations to those organizations

123
00:08:53,64 --> 00:08:57,38
supposedly on the part of him
and then representing them

124
00:08:57,38 --> 00:09:01,50
and if the other people don't
get their viewpoint put across

125
00:09:02,30 --> 00:09:03,30
and aren't represented.

126
00:09:03,52 --> 00:09:07,88
Then i think you know they're
generally not happy with the outcomes

127
00:09:07,88 --> 00:09:11,21
and don't get the benefit from
that process that they could.

128
00:09:12,52 --> 00:09:14,96
I'm not saying that i think

129
00:09:14,96 --> 00:09:18,64
that anyone who's you know not involved
in politics is doing the wrong thing

130
00:09:18,64 --> 00:09:23,26
and i recognize that you know sort of
political involvement and activity.

131
00:09:23,47 --> 00:09:26,69
You know doesn't suit
most people but i think

132
00:09:26,69 --> 00:09:31,80
that there are other ways in which people
can have their voice heard in you know

133
00:09:31,80 --> 00:09:38,46
just going and talking to people or
writing letters or somehow you know not.

134
00:09:38,52 --> 00:09:42,62
Not just sort of sitting back in the hills
and letting it all happen around them

135
00:09:42,62 --> 00:09:45,98
or sitting at that in their house in
the village but somehow getting out

136
00:09:45,98 --> 00:09:48,09
and at least talking to people just

137
00:09:48,10 --> 00:09:52,79
that very active talking to other people
about how you feel about things has you

138
00:09:52,79 --> 00:09:55,84
know impact on the outcome
for the community

139
00:09:55,84 --> 00:09:59,25
and it might be only a tiny
little thing but you know.

140
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:02,40
Millions of grains of sand make up a beat

141
00:10:02,40 --> 00:10:04,65
and you know they all have a part to play.

142
00:10:04,96 --> 00:10:07,94
So i'd like to sort of hope

143
00:10:07,94 --> 00:10:12,72
that you know over the next five to 10 years
we'll see more involvement from people

144
00:10:12,72 --> 00:10:17,56
who you know traditionally traditionally
haven't been part of community politics

145
00:10:17,56 --> 00:10:24,19
because if we don't i think we'll
see niman very much influenced by

146
00:10:24,19 --> 00:10:26,95
perhaps the more you know
conservative backlash

147
00:10:26,95 --> 00:10:32,06
and also by the interest of developers.

148
00:10:33,96 --> 00:10:52,69
Time.

149
00:10:54,40 --> 00:10:54,68
I think

150
00:10:54,68 --> 00:10:59,31
that in the early days it was it was a lot
easier for people to come here to just

151
00:10:59,31 --> 00:11:03,78
buy their piece of land in the hills just
go into the hills live into the here live

152
00:11:03,78 --> 00:11:06,23
in the hills and just come into
nim and to do their shopping

153
00:11:06,23 --> 00:11:07,88
or go to listen more to do their shopping.

154
00:11:08,16 --> 00:11:10,69
It was much easier to live
that sort of lifestyle.

155
00:11:11,22 --> 00:11:14,18
Now i think the reality is

156
00:11:14,18 --> 00:11:18,11
that the hills have become you know sort
of more developed there's more people it's

157
00:11:18,11 --> 00:11:21,14
much harder to be isolated
as it was in those days

158
00:11:21,96 --> 00:11:26,11
and i think there's also the reality that
that sort of lifestyle is very difficult.

159
00:11:26,52 --> 00:11:32,05
It's we all came here with our
ideals that have been sort of shaped

160
00:11:32,06 --> 00:11:32,97
and whittled away

161
00:11:32,97 --> 00:11:38,80
and changed by the reality of living in you
know this sort of lifestyle under these

162
00:11:38,80 --> 00:11:44,97
types of conditions and it's it's
hard. Now for people to sort of.

163
00:11:44,99 --> 00:11:46,06
Sort of sit back

164
00:11:46,06 --> 00:11:50,31
and just watch what happens around them
because they're going to be affected by it.

165
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:55,60
What was the question you asked. You.

166
00:11:55,62 --> 00:11:59,59
I think the key thing at stake now
is that niman is in the process of.

167
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,30
Undergoing more change than it's
undergone since aquarius 20 years ago.

168
00:12:04,43 --> 00:12:09,41
I mean that that event had a
great impact on the village

169
00:12:09,41 --> 00:12:11,83
and obviously the village
changed direction then

170
00:12:12,56 --> 00:12:16,22
and i think now the villages at the
point of changing direction again

171
00:12:17,06 --> 00:12:19,40
and those people have moved
here over the last 20 years

172
00:12:19,40 --> 00:12:21,83
and say in the first 10
years from aquarius.

173
00:12:22,03 --> 00:12:24,31
If they want to see nim
and retain the things

174
00:12:24,31 --> 00:12:28,55
that are important to them they're
going to have to be part of

175
00:12:28,55 --> 00:12:31,04
that process of having a say

176
00:12:31,04 --> 00:12:36,80
and putting for putting forward the
things that they want to retain

177
00:12:36,80 --> 00:12:42,26
and emphasising you know the positive
aspects of those sorts of things which are

178
00:12:42,99 --> 00:12:46,72
primarily the reasons why we've all moved
to you know the greater emphasis on

179
00:12:46,72 --> 00:12:50,99
self-sustainability the
less consumerist lifestyle.

180
00:12:51,07 --> 00:12:56,34
Not being stuck in the 95 five day a
week work routine doesn't mean to say

181
00:12:56,34 --> 00:12:58,32
that we work any less
hard than anyone else

182
00:12:58,32 --> 00:13:00,29
but you know we're doing it for ourselves.

183
00:13:01,66 --> 00:13:03,26
If people want to retain the things

184
00:13:03,26 --> 00:13:08,48
that are of importance to them then
they're going to have to be a part of the

185
00:13:08,48 --> 00:13:10,65
process of change in a positive way.

186
00:13:11,45 --> 00:13:16,83
Otherwise i believe they're not going
to be happy with the outcomes.

187
00:13:16,85 --> 00:13:26,60
Much.

188
00:13:28,12 --> 00:13:31,17
Time.

189
00:13:32,14 --> 00:13:40,97
Or.

190
00:13:40,99 --> 00:13:44,06
I think things have come to a head in them

191
00:13:44,06 --> 00:13:46,82
and over the past few years
for several reasons.

192
00:13:48,32 --> 00:13:49,59
Primarily i believe

193
00:13:49,59 --> 00:13:54,61
that people from outside have seen
the possibility of selling them

194
00:13:54,61 --> 00:13:59,93
and selling them and to the the broader
community and i think you know it's.

195
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:00,99
It's very real

196
00:14:00,99 --> 00:14:06,58
and it's definitely there as a potential
i think the challenge for nim

197
00:14:06,58 --> 00:14:09,76
and people who live in niman is
to try and influence that process

198
00:14:10,69 --> 00:14:16,94
and to have some say in the outcome for
instance i believe that it's inevitable

199
00:14:16,94 --> 00:14:23,38
that somebody is going to start
promoting nimbin more strongly as a

200
00:14:23,38 --> 00:14:26,45
a tourist destination or a tourist venue

201
00:14:27,68 --> 00:14:30,84
and i am excited by the idea

202
00:14:30,84 --> 00:14:36,46
that the community itself could
decide what shape and form they want

203
00:14:36,46 --> 00:14:41,94
that tourist development to take
and i believe that if we don't do

204
00:14:41,94 --> 00:14:45,45
that then people from outside
will come in and do it.

205
00:14:45,57 --> 00:14:49,93
Which isn't necessarily a
problem except for i believe

206
00:14:49,93 --> 00:14:53,81
that they won't be promoting what it.

207
00:14:53,85 --> 00:14:54,44
The things

208
00:14:54,44 --> 00:14:58,88
that are important to us the integrity
of niman because they don't know it.

209
00:15:00,95 --> 00:15:02,20
I think the other things are

210
00:15:02,20 --> 00:15:07,70
that the population of niman is about
to grow as the village area has been

211
00:15:07,70 --> 00:15:10,31
increased dramatically over the last year

212
00:15:11,29 --> 00:15:16,60
and we're now likely to see the
population in the village.

213
00:15:16,61 --> 00:15:21,38
Because i think the other thing that's
going to have an influence on niman is

214
00:15:21,38 --> 00:15:27,11
that the actual area of the village has
changed dramatically over the past year

215
00:15:27,11 --> 00:15:28,49
through landry zoning

216
00:15:29,33 --> 00:15:33,06
and we're now likely to see the population
of the village grow from three hundred

217
00:15:33,06 --> 00:15:38,09
fifty to a thousand people which is going
to put an incredible strain on the

218
00:15:38,09 --> 00:15:39,46
village resources

219
00:15:39,46 --> 00:15:44,04
but will also sort of bring a lot more
people into the area were also in the

220
00:15:44,04 --> 00:15:49,04
process of seeing the land surrounding the
village rezoning to rural residential

221
00:15:49,04 --> 00:15:52,07
and once again that's going to
increase the population dramatically.

222
00:15:52,38 --> 00:15:57,59
So there's these sort of competing interests
there's the population of the village

223
00:15:57,59 --> 00:15:59,92
increasing dramatically in surrounding.

224
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,83
Areas there's increase
it of tourist potential

225
00:16:03,83 --> 00:16:08,60
and people wanting to capitalize
on that and there's no way

226
00:16:08,60 --> 00:16:10,57
that niman in its current shape and form.

227
00:16:11,05 --> 00:16:13,24
Can you know can cope with

228
00:16:13,24 --> 00:16:15,90
that animal's going to have to
change to be able to cope with it.

229
00:16:15,97 --> 00:16:17,48
Otherwise you know we're
all going to think

230
00:16:17,48 --> 00:16:19,31
and i mean that's that's
not going to happen.

231
00:16:20,04 --> 00:16:25,22
So i think there's a great opportunity
for us to sort of shape our own future.

232
00:16:26,16 --> 00:16:28,13
And my word of warning would be

233
00:16:28,13 --> 00:16:30,68
that if if we done other
people will do it for us

234
00:16:30,68 --> 00:16:37,79
and we won't like what we get.

235
00:16:37,81 --> 00:16:48,31
So.

236
00:16:48,33 --> 00:16:55,28
Niman gets a lot of publicity. Some of
it's positive. A lot of it is negative.

237
00:16:55,57 --> 00:16:59,71
I think if you look at the name of nim

238
00:16:59,71 --> 00:17:04,31
and further afield you know it's almost
synonymous with the name of you know the

239
00:17:04,31 --> 00:17:10,14
word drugs. I think that's that's very
unfortunate it's very small part of nim

240
00:17:10,14 --> 00:17:14,81
and life it happens to be focused on the
main street which is probably why it

241
00:17:14,81 --> 00:17:21,10
achieves a great deal of attention.
I have seen quite a lot of.

242
00:17:21,12 --> 00:17:27,44
You know positive nim and coverage
by the media and i believe

243
00:17:27,44 --> 00:17:31,85
that there is that a perception
in the wider community.

244
00:17:32,49 --> 00:17:36,06
You know throughout australia
and across the world that nim

245
00:17:36,06 --> 00:17:40,12
and represents a different way of
living and alternative lifestyles.

246
00:17:40,21 --> 00:17:44,03
If you like but it's a choice that.

247
00:17:44,04 --> 00:17:47,65
Challenges and confronts
the dominant paradigm.

248
00:17:48,57 --> 00:17:52,16
And now i can't even remember
what i'm talking about.

249
00:17:52,43 --> 00:17:56,85
So i think that.

250
00:17:56,86 --> 00:17:59,48
Nim and certainly sick of being portrayed.

251
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,94
There's the drug capital of australia

252
00:18:02,88 --> 00:18:07,33
and i think it's a very
unfair label to pin on women

253
00:18:08,23 --> 00:18:13,31
and there are many of us in the community
who work very hard to promote the

254
00:18:13,31 --> 00:18:17,08
positive images of niman and. I
mean there's a multitude of them.

255
00:18:17,11 --> 00:18:22,15
It's not hard to find you know so many
sort of positive things about the nym

256
00:18:22,15 --> 00:18:24,20
and lifestyle.

257
00:18:24,22 --> 00:18:27,73
I think it's been damaging
to us as a community the way

258
00:18:27,73 --> 00:18:33,22
that we've been portrayed in it in the media
i think it's very common for us to see

259
00:18:34,12 --> 00:18:38,85
journalists come in from
outside do a story on nim and

260
00:18:38,85 --> 00:18:45,66
when they really only get a very superficial
insight into the lifestyles of people

261
00:18:45,66 --> 00:18:50,30
hear the name and village the complexity
of the issues that you know exist here

262
00:18:51,15 --> 00:18:55,18
and then go away and write a story that
then you know on top of that gets edited

263
00:18:56,03 --> 00:19:02,57
and we get portrayed in a fairly superficial
way i've seen some very good media

264
00:19:02,57 --> 00:19:03,77
reports on women.

265
00:19:03,77 --> 00:19:05,96
I'd have to say and those sorts of things

266
00:19:05,96 --> 00:19:08,88
that i think we should be you
know we should be encouraging.

267
00:19:09,96 --> 00:19:14,03
I think it really also is up to the
community to take the initiative to promote

268
00:19:14,03 --> 00:19:17,34
itself positively further afield.

269
00:19:17,76 --> 00:19:22,26
You know throughout australia not for
the purposes of bringing tourists here

270
00:19:22,26 --> 00:19:26,87
although it's an inevitable consequence
of it but more because i believe

271
00:19:26,87 --> 00:19:30,11
that nym and have something to
offer to the rest of australia.

272
00:19:30,62 --> 00:19:33,57
You know to the rest of the world
really i mean we're not unique

273
00:19:34,38 --> 00:19:38,10
but you know it's just something
that's happening here and i believe

274
00:19:38,10 --> 00:19:41,52
that people elsewhere
would be interested in it

275
00:19:41,52 --> 00:19:46,39
and in fact i can remember there was
a program on the a b c about us.

276
00:19:46,40 --> 00:19:48,23
Two years ago on couch

277
00:19:48,23 --> 00:19:54,29
and the feedback from
australia was phenomenal.

278
00:19:54,67 --> 00:19:58,90
You know it was people really wanting to
hear more about what we're on about the

279
00:19:58,90 --> 00:19:59,73
things that are important.

280
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,06
And to us how we live our lives just really
sort of basic fundamental things about

281
00:20:05,06 --> 00:20:09,66
how do we. This and you know those
things are exciting those are the things

282
00:20:09,66 --> 00:20:12,17
that i would really like to share and

283
00:20:12,17 --> 00:20:16,53
that i'm sure other people in
yemen are quite open to sharing.

284
00:20:16,55 --> 00:20:20,30
You know those sorts of
those sorts of values

285
00:20:20,30 --> 00:20:24,58
but i think we're pretty sick
of being in the media spotlight

286
00:20:24,58 --> 00:20:35,76
when we just get portrayed in a fairly
negative representative unrealistic way.

287
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:45,95
I think the acquiring aquarian ideals
have had to be modified substantially the

288
00:20:45,95 --> 00:20:50,55
people who sort of came here with
the vision of living in the hills

289
00:20:50,55 --> 00:20:56,12
and dropping out and creating
their own sort of life and values

290
00:20:56,12 --> 00:21:00,91
and being self-sustainable
have had to realize

291
00:21:00,91 --> 00:21:03,49
that that's just a very difficult path

292
00:21:03,49 --> 00:21:08,59
and in fact it's not possible to cut
yourself off from the rest of the rest of

293
00:21:08,59 --> 00:21:14,25
society and that no matter how we like it
you know it. It follows this everywhere.

294
00:21:14,27 --> 00:21:16,89
I think a lot of what.

295
00:21:16,90 --> 00:21:19,82
Aquarius was the aquarius festival

296
00:21:19,82 --> 00:21:23,62
and its values a lot of those values
are still are still relevant today

297
00:21:23,62 --> 00:21:27,14
that we've been at the forefront of.

298
00:21:27,66 --> 00:21:29,58
A lot of change in australia

299
00:21:29,58 --> 00:21:35,55
and primarily you know environmental issues
come to mind as perhaps being you know

300
00:21:35,55 --> 00:21:37,35
some of the most important things

301
00:21:38,32 --> 00:21:44,72
that are left sort of consumer oriented
lifestyle which was you know very much part

302
00:21:44,72 --> 00:21:51,52
of the aquarius aquarius vision more
self-sustainability more reliance on

303
00:21:51,52 --> 00:21:56,17
you know ourselves as individuals rather
than looking at looking to governments

304
00:21:56,17 --> 00:21:59,86
and the powers that be to
provide for our needs and.

305
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,75
I think we have been able to sort of
demonstrate that it is possible to do

306
00:22:03,75 --> 00:22:06,51
that around here not just around here

307
00:22:06,51 --> 00:22:10,88
but in other parts of australia
obviously those things are happening.

308
00:22:10,90 --> 00:22:11,80
I think too

309
00:22:11,80 --> 00:22:18,67
that it's given us an opportunity to enable
us to provide a more sort of extended

310
00:22:18,67 --> 00:22:22,18
family to build on a
greater sense of community

311
00:22:22,18 --> 00:22:28,23
and that's very much part of you know
european asian and aboriginal lifestyles

312
00:22:28,23 --> 00:22:32,74
but it hasn't been part of you know sort
of white anglo lifestyles i mean most

313
00:22:32,74 --> 00:22:36,67
people grow up leave home and see their
families that easter or christmas.

314
00:22:37,18 --> 00:22:40,87
Whereas here i believe a
lot of people live with

315
00:22:40,87 --> 00:22:47,16
that with support from other people does a
much sort of stronger community emphasis

316
00:22:47,16 --> 00:22:48,84
and community base and the one thing

317
00:22:48,84 --> 00:22:52,51
that is really important to
me about niman is that i know

318
00:22:52,51 --> 00:22:56,83
that you know if anything happens there
are people here who will look after me

319
00:22:56,83 --> 00:22:59,91
and their people i know
they're my friends and

320
00:22:59,92 --> 00:23:03,08
that if anything if my daughters
walking up and down the street.

321
00:23:03,09 --> 00:23:03,38
I know

322
00:23:03,38 --> 00:23:07,52
that there are people on the street who
are going to look after it's it's a very

323
00:23:07,52 --> 00:23:08,93
safe place to live

324
00:23:08,93 --> 00:23:15,11
and you know it's a generally not a violent
place it's a very sort of peaceful

325
00:23:15,11 --> 00:23:20,54
place. I mean we might get sort of
vocal a loud with each other but

326
00:23:20,55 --> 00:23:25,06
and there might be a lot of sort of you
know sort of hidden violence sort of

327
00:23:25,06 --> 00:23:26,48
domestic violence and stuff

328
00:23:26,48 --> 00:23:31,12
but i'm talking about generally women
particularly feel safe in them

329
00:23:31,12 --> 00:23:33,60
and it's a fairly you know
it's a safe place to be

330
00:23:33,60 --> 00:23:38,61
and i think the aquarian vision
was certainly to create a safe.

331
00:23:39,46 --> 00:23:41,58
You know sort of happy
lifestyle for people.

332
00:23:42,55 --> 00:23:47,74
It's a very sound very trite actually and.

333
00:23:47,75 --> 00:23:52,20
Well take out the happy. It
is a safe place. Definitely.

334
00:23:53,52 --> 00:23:59,96
Work. I think also part
of the equerry invasion.

335
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:05,22
With that people would be empowered
to provide their own housing

336
00:24:05,22 --> 00:24:09,57
and that's been an area which i think
it's been incredibly successful.

337
00:24:10,84 --> 00:24:14,50
There are a lot of owner builders around
here who've been able to build their

338
00:24:14,50 --> 00:24:17,69
houses without borrowing money
and you know i'd like to stress

339
00:24:17,69 --> 00:24:21,53
that if you live on a multiple occupancy
can't borrow money because you don't

340
00:24:21,53 --> 00:24:22,71
actually own anything.

341
00:24:23,77 --> 00:24:28,63
And that's been a really a powerful
thing because when you've got a home

342
00:24:28,63 --> 00:24:32,52
and you've got some security
neighbours you to move forward in life

343
00:24:32,52 --> 00:24:34,69
and you're not stuck into
paying off a mortgage.

344
00:24:35,08 --> 00:24:37,55
You've got a lot more
options with your life.

345
00:24:38,45 --> 00:24:43,88
I think another area that's been really
positive is the concept of shared land

346
00:24:43,88 --> 00:24:49,33
ownership. There are a lot of
people who would really recoil from

347
00:24:49,33 --> 00:24:52,41
that to the idea of owning
land with other people.

348
00:24:53,30 --> 00:24:57,53
Is something that's particularly
pleasant to them but i think in them

349
00:24:57,53 --> 00:25:00,63
and we've demonstrated that groups
of people can come together

350
00:25:00,63 --> 00:25:02,75
and can own things together and

351
00:25:02,75 --> 00:25:06,66
that it can have really positive effects
through just sharing of knowledge

352
00:25:06,66 --> 00:25:07,75
and skills.

353
00:25:07,98 --> 00:25:13,51
So the sharing of resources through
the social support network that

354
00:25:13,51 --> 00:25:16,76
that office has a multitude of benefits

355
00:25:16,76 --> 00:25:21,22
and i'm i'm really proud to be part
of you know a movement that's set

356
00:25:21,22 --> 00:25:23,31
that as an example for
the rest of australia

357
00:25:24,44 --> 00:25:28,82
and i guess i'd equate it with living in
group housing in sydney where you share a

358
00:25:28,82 --> 00:25:29,89
house with a group of people

359
00:25:29,89 --> 00:25:33,67
and i mean anyone who's lived in sydney
in a group house knows that potentially

360
00:25:33,67 --> 00:25:36,61
that can be a very difficult situation

361
00:25:37,37 --> 00:25:41,25
and in sydney the opportunity exists where
where if you're not happy in one group

362
00:25:41,25 --> 00:25:43,37
house you can move into
another group house.

363
00:25:43,55 --> 00:25:45,43
You know it keeps your rents down

364
00:25:45,43 --> 00:25:48,18
and there's more options up
here it's not like that.

365
00:25:48,26 --> 00:25:53,65
If you buy a share in a multiple occupancy
it's extremely difficult to move from

366
00:25:53,65 --> 00:25:54,28
one to the other.

367
00:25:55,09 --> 00:25:58,31
So we're in a position of really
having to work on those differences

368
00:25:58,31 --> 00:25:59,93
that arise personal do.

369
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,59
Princes and learning to sort
of respect personal difference

370
00:26:03,59 --> 00:26:05,49
and to respect other people's values

371
00:26:06,53 --> 00:26:12,16
and i think that's been a really valuable
thing about you know sort of from the

372
00:26:12,16 --> 00:26:17,01
equestrian vision and i think we've
learnt a lot about communication.

373
00:26:17,05 --> 00:26:19,56
We've learnt a lot about
conflict resolution.

374
00:26:20,22 --> 00:26:24,44
We've learnt a lot about just
developing our own personal skills

375
00:26:25,63 --> 00:26:27,53
and those are sort of benefits

376
00:26:27,53 --> 00:26:31,54
that you know the rest of the rest
of the community benefits from

377
00:26:31,54 --> 00:26:34,54
when we then take those
into a community arena

378
00:26:34,55 --> 00:26:41,24
and i mean community in the broader sense
not a multiple occupancy community.

379
00:26:42,70 --> 00:26:48,71
I think the benefits for for
children of this sort of lifestyle.

380
00:26:49,53 --> 00:26:55,31
Tremendous i mean firstly they get
to live in a rural area and i think

381
00:26:55,31 --> 00:26:58,97
that has a lot of a lot
of benefits for children.

382
00:26:59,78 --> 00:27:02,53
They've got space they've got
a beautiful environment.

383
00:27:02,55 --> 00:27:08,00
I think also the fact that they do
they are part of an extended family

384
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:13,82
and extended social network is
also of incredible importance

385
00:27:13,82 --> 00:27:17,04
and i'd have to say on a personal
level as a single parent.

386
00:27:17,07 --> 00:27:18,63
It's been invaluable to me.

387
00:27:19,66 --> 00:27:23,19
The support that i've been given not
only by my community and the people

388
00:27:23,19 --> 00:27:28,62
that i live with but also by
people within the name and area.

389
00:27:28,79 --> 00:27:35,17
Generally i think also there are
lots of things being offered here

390
00:27:35,86 --> 00:27:41,71
to children that perhaps don't exist
in say you know in city areas.

391
00:27:42,65 --> 00:27:45,07
So they're learning some
really valuable skills

392
00:27:45,07 --> 00:27:49,04
and i my own daughter already helps me
with building you know she'll pick up a

393
00:27:49,04 --> 00:27:53,47
hammer. I never picked up a hammer
into line moved here at the age of 30

394
00:27:53,48 --> 00:27:59,42
or whatever it was and.
Just having a very a very.

395
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,28
Call a life which most children
who live in rural areas have

396
00:28:03,99 --> 00:28:06,84
but in a notional together.
That we're stuck.

397
00:28:08,20 --> 00:28:11,55
I think another benefit for tilden
is just the range of schooling

398
00:28:11,55 --> 00:28:14,67
and educational options that
are available to them here.

399
00:28:14,93 --> 00:28:17,17
I think in the niman area we have six

400
00:28:17,17 --> 00:28:22,63
or seven different schools with
different educational philosophies

401
00:28:22,64 --> 00:28:26,07
and parents are able
to choose to a degree.

402
00:28:26,26 --> 00:28:28,26
You know which school they
send their children to

403
00:28:29,09 --> 00:28:31,15
that will most suit the
needs of their children.

404
00:28:31,16 --> 00:28:34,17
I can't think of you know
many other places where

405
00:28:34,17 --> 00:28:38,15
that sort of range of options
would exist in a rural area.

406
00:28:38,17 --> 00:28:39,51
I think i'd have to say

407
00:28:39,51 --> 00:28:45,65
that my concern in relation to young people
living in this type of environment is

408
00:28:45,66 --> 00:28:52,42
when they reach teenage years. It's
very often that those at those.

409
00:28:52,43 --> 00:28:55,06
It's very often that that
at that age in your life.

410
00:28:55,17 --> 00:28:59,08
The most important thing for you is to
be with your peers and i can remember

411
00:28:59,08 --> 00:28:59,71
that myself

412
00:29:00,75 --> 00:29:05,34
and although i lived in a in a rural area
it was only two miles for me to get into

413
00:29:05,34 --> 00:29:08,51
town and i could walk it whereas
for many people around them

414
00:29:08,51 --> 00:29:10,51
and they live a lot further
out of town than that

415
00:29:11,30 --> 00:29:16,02
and it's much harder for teenagers to be
able to get into town to spend the night

416
00:29:16,02 --> 00:29:19,62
in town or the evening in town and
then to be able to get safely home.

417
00:29:20,98 --> 00:29:21,35
I think

418
00:29:21,35 --> 00:29:26,12
that communities really still need to do
a lot of work on what they offer their

419
00:29:26,12 --> 00:29:32,77
teenage use and it excites me to see a
community like timetable falls community.

420
00:29:33,92 --> 00:29:38,31
You know one of our most established
communities actually putting a great deal of

421
00:29:38,31 --> 00:29:42,76
time and effort and resources into
looking after their teenagers

422
00:29:42,76 --> 00:29:47,58
and trying to give teenagers options
within their own community that mean

423
00:29:47,58 --> 00:29:53,67
that they can stay there for a community
like my own where we have a much smaller

424
00:29:53,67 --> 00:29:54,66
population.

425
00:29:54,70 --> 00:29:59,83
There's a lot more pressure on us to get
our children into town to sort of be.

426
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,09
Part of what's happening there and
then to be able to get them out again.

427
00:30:04,36 --> 00:30:08,07
So it is a challenge for us and
it's one that i don't feel

428
00:30:08,07 --> 00:30:11,23
that we have we have adequately addressed.

429
00:30:11,35 --> 00:30:14,26
I think the other problem
for us is the fact

430
00:30:14,26 --> 00:30:18,08
that we do have a drug scene that's
so concentrated on the main street

431
00:30:18,08 --> 00:30:23,34
and it is a scene that's very
attractive to you know teenage.

432
00:30:23,76 --> 00:30:24,89
Youth when they're going through

433
00:30:24,89 --> 00:30:29,39
that sort of rebelling against everything
cutting ties with the family and stuff

434
00:30:30,26 --> 00:30:31,40
and that's a concern to me.

435
00:30:31,44 --> 00:30:35,94
I think it's really important that
we offer our children a say street

436
00:30:35,94 --> 00:30:37,21
and i believe

437
00:30:37,21 --> 00:30:42,12
that whilst in lots of ways it is a
very safe place to be the drug scene is

438
00:30:42,12 --> 00:30:46,23
something that we haven't
really come to terms with and

439
00:30:46,23 --> 00:30:50,27
that it does have this sort of
almost fatal attraction to teenagers

440
00:30:50,27 --> 00:30:53,98
and some of them will get sucked in
and you know most of them don't.

441
00:30:54,15 --> 00:30:59,01
But some of them will and somehow we
have to look at that as a community

442
00:30:59,01 --> 00:31:03,26
and i think it's probably one of the
most difficult problems that we face

443
00:31:03,26 --> 00:31:05,81
and yet one of the most important
because it's the thing

444
00:31:05,81 --> 00:31:11,32
that most directly affects
our own children's lives.

445
00:31:14,26 --> 00:31:17,92
It really concerns me that
a lot of our teenage youth

446
00:31:17,92 --> 00:31:21,46
that surely end up leaving them
then and i'd like to think

447
00:31:21,46 --> 00:31:28,08
that we had more to offer in terms
of job opportunities people

448
00:31:28,09 --> 00:31:31,36
creating their own employment.

449
00:31:31,38 --> 00:31:34,36
I i believe that you know i
mean teenagers generally leave

450
00:31:34,36 --> 00:31:36,08
and want to go somewhere else

451
00:31:36,08 --> 00:31:40,90
and it's heartening for me to see
you know some of those teenagers

452
00:31:40,90 --> 00:31:44,50
that surely return to nim and after
they've been away for a while

453
00:31:44,50 --> 00:31:51,89
and.
