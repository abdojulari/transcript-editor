00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:15,24
Welcome to this most important and timely symposium on the eight hundredth anniversary of the Magna Carta.

3
00:00:15,25 --> 00:00:23,34
I start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we come together they get a go of the nation pay

4
00:00:23,34 --> 00:00:28,62
my respects to their elders past and present and to indigenous people here today.

5
00:00:30,51 --> 00:00:38,1
I acknowledge shared freedoms and responsibilities in heritage from Magna Carta through the common law.

6
00:00:39,14 --> 00:00:46,22
Very apt things to say today and I also acknowledge that welcoming of the peoples and cultures of the world.

7
00:00:46,23 --> 00:00:53,81
All three elements shaping a stray. Pleased to welcome our speakers. NICHOLAS COWDERY Q.C.

President as a library Council of New South Wales and a master of ceremonies Emeritus Professor David Camm

10
00:01:06,43 --> 00:01:12,64
and I am president of the history Council of New South Wales and all of our distinguished guests.

11
00:01:12,82 --> 00:01:14,77

12
00:01:15,57 --> 00:01:22,55
Sorry you wanting me you'll join me in thanking our organizers and especially Dr Mandy Krishna.

13

Executive Officer of the history Council of New South Wales.

14
00:01:27,84 --> 00:01:32,42
They've done a marvelous job in bringing this meeting together.

15
00:01:32,44 --> 00:01:41,6
A library is an amazing place amazing buildings and so much to offer with over six million items in our collection.

16
00:01:41,65 --> 00:01:47,81
It's a vibrant treasure house of knowledge as puts it this library holds the D.N.A.

17
00:01:47,81 --> 00:01:55,24
Of a strategy of the greatest collection on at country and it's region peoples and our cultures.

18
00:01:55,26 --> 00:02:03,39
And of course we hold an early copy of Magna Carta which is. On display today just to my left and in the Bronx.

19
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:10,13
You can look at it and my colleague Maggie Patton will tell you a little bit about its history.

20
00:02:10,25 --> 00:02:13,82
It's one of the many irreplaceable our times in our collection.

21
00:02:14,84 --> 00:02:20,23
It dates from the early fourteenth century it was included in a compilation of the statutes of England.

22
00:02:20,25 --> 00:02:23,16
Evidently travelling advocate.

23
00:02:24,45 --> 00:02:30,73
The idea hundredth anniversary of the ceiling of Magna Carta in a few weeks on the fifteenth of June provides the

24
00:02:30,73 --> 00:02:35,58
appropriate opportunity to read examine this document and its role in British

25
00:02:35,58 --> 00:02:43,8
and Australian history that ceiling marked an important step in the movement away from the tree monarchical road

26
00:02:43,8 --> 00:02:51,12
towards responsible constitutional government speech seen as a foundation document for the rights of citizens including

27
00:02:51,12 --> 00:02:53,54
the essential rights to freedom of expression

28
00:02:54,38 --> 00:03:01,16
and freedom of access to information rights which are fundamental to libraries and to this great library.

29
00:03:01,38 --> 00:03:07,55
We stand for the right of all to express their views peacefully and respecting the rights of others

30
00:03:08,41 --> 00:03:12,26
and for those views to be recorded in our collections.

31
00:03:12,28 --> 00:03:12,84
The heart

32
00:03:12,84 --> 00:03:20,37
and security of same here today as being necessary to safeguard that right of free expression to protect this valuable

33
00:03:20,37 --> 00:03:28,67
document and to protect library Raiders and visitors. Many say to limit the rights expressed in Magna Carta.

34
00:03:29,19 --> 00:03:31,7
And develop three successive centuries.

35
00:03:32,03 --> 00:03:38,55
You know other key documents on human rights and of course incorporated into our legal system. All of a Cromwell.

36
00:03:39,33 --> 00:03:44,62
The Lord Protector of England famously use scatological rhyming slang to dismiss Magna Carta.

37
00:03:45,76 --> 00:03:52,4
And similarly you scuttle logically abuse the lighter petition of rod. I'm not allowed to use his words here.

38
00:03:54,37 --> 00:03:59,56
Many have followed him in denying seeking to limit human rights instruments whether from.

39
00:04:01,12 --> 00:04:08,59
Well lack of respect for others all seek to deny the rights of others this great institution straight his oldest

40
00:04:08,59 --> 00:04:14,72
library stands for freedom of expression and freedom of access to information in common. Without the libraries.

41
00:04:14,75 --> 00:04:19,29
We're open to all and our collection encompasses all views.

42
00:04:20,37 --> 00:04:26,23
We're proud to work with the history Council of New South Wales to host this important symposium.

43
00:04:26,5 --> 00:04:30,53
It's now my pleasant duty to introduce him so you for today.

44
00:04:32,04 --> 00:04:33,78
Emeritus Professor David Cameron

45
00:04:33,78 --> 00:04:41,32
and I go back a long way since we both worked at the Northern Territory University now Charles Darwin University my

46
00:04:41,32 --> 00:04:46,07
colleagues for many years. It's a great pleasure to welcome David. To the podium. Thank you.

47
00:04:46,19 --> 00:04:58,93
Thank you thank you Dr Alex Bernd for that wonderful introduction I would also like to welcome you here on behalf of

48
00:04:58,93 --> 00:05:01,6
the history Council yourself whiles.

49
00:05:02,1 --> 00:05:11,55
And as Alex did I would acknowledge the traditional owners of the land where we currently placed the chemical PEOPLE OF

50
00:05:11,55 --> 00:05:12,97
THE NATION.

51
00:05:13,02 --> 00:05:19,34
I always believe that it's particularly appropriate to do that on an occasion when we are discussing history.

52
00:05:19,5 --> 00:05:22,3
My remarks now will be brief.

53
00:05:23,3 --> 00:05:28,77
The history Council was delighted to be approached by the Magna Carta Committee

54
00:05:28,77 --> 00:05:39,44
and the role of the institute to be involved in this event and I'm so pleased that it has attracted a good response.

55
00:05:39,86 --> 00:05:45,58
The event has been fully booked and I think that indicates that there is a real thirst for knowledge

56
00:05:45,58 --> 00:05:50,31
and understanding of the Magna Carta in this very important year

57
00:05:50,31 --> 00:05:59,7
when we commemorate what happened so many hundreds of years ago. I remarked to Nick Cowdery as we were.

58
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,99
Waiting outside that like many historians. I don't know nearly as much about the Magna Carta as I ought to.

59
00:06:07,87 --> 00:06:11,94
My history is quite good for the ancient period and quite good from about the seventeen.

60
00:06:12,03 --> 00:06:20,14
Hundreds on boards but there is a regrettable gap that I'm just in recent years it's been trying to fill in.

61
00:06:20,14 --> 00:06:25,19
So I'm hoping to learn a great deal today and I'm sure the time Will.

62
00:06:25,21 --> 00:06:30,69
I'd like to take this opportunity of thanking the Magna Carta Committee

63
00:06:30,69 --> 00:06:37,65
and the Rule of Law Institute for their initiative with this event it was a pleasure to work with them.

64
00:06:37,87 --> 00:06:41,8
I'd also like to. Pipe to Cuba.

65
00:06:42,3 --> 00:06:49,76
A tribute to my predecessor as president of the history Council Emeritus Professor Richard Waterhouse he did much of

66
00:06:49,76 --> 00:06:53,12
the initial work in getting this event together

67
00:06:53,96 --> 00:07:02,02
and I don't think it would have happened without his efforts as well I'd like to acknowledge the hard work particularly

68
00:07:02,02 --> 00:07:09,08
over the last month or so of my Dr Mann to critique the executive officer of the history Council

69
00:07:09,08 --> 00:07:15,72
and the administrative assistants. Stephanie Holland's. They have helped to.

70
00:07:15,74 --> 00:07:19,67
Again make this event practical practical and possible

71
00:07:19,67 --> 00:07:25,94
and they have been all sorts of last minute details to which the I have to attend finally

72
00:07:25,95 --> 00:07:28,85
and I'll thank them again at the end did I

73
00:07:28,85 --> 00:07:37,03
but I'd like to express my gratitude to the speakers we've got a very eminent group of speakers people who come to us

74
00:07:37,03 --> 00:07:39,6
with.

75
00:07:39,61 --> 00:07:45,63
A great deal of expertise people who are also very busy so it's great to have them they are

76
00:07:45,63 --> 00:07:56,65
and I think that as the day goes on we'll appreciate their presence any more on just a couple of practical housekeeping

77
00:07:56,65 --> 00:07:59,63
announcements the event is being filmed.

78
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:08,5
DI and as is often the case this kind of occasion I would ask everyone to make sure that they my pal phones are off.

79
00:08:09,06 --> 00:08:16,12
Throughout the day and I've been guilty myself speaking at an occasion like this of having my phone go off.

80
00:08:16,14 --> 00:08:16,7
It's very embarrassing

81
00:08:17,67 --> 00:08:25,49
and it's also a problem if it's off in the audience so if you could do that I'd be nice to grateful

82
00:08:25,49 --> 00:08:33,51
or without further ado I'd like to to now introduce Professor Nick Cowdery from the Magna Carta Committee. Thank you.

83
00:08:33,59 --> 00:08:37,26
Good morning ladies and gentlemen my task.

84
00:08:37,36 --> 00:08:45,72
Just at the moment is to welcome you all here on behalf of the Magna Carta Committee of the role of the Institute of

85
00:08:45,72 --> 00:08:51,15
Australia. A sponsor of this event with the history society.

86
00:08:52,45 --> 00:09:01,75
The Rule of Law Institute is a very active group of people who engage in a number of different kinds of activity

87
00:09:01,75 --> 00:09:05,16
directed towards the promotion of the rule of law

88
00:09:05,16 --> 00:09:12,88
and the protection of the rule of law as a fundamental principle of government and governance in our community

89
00:09:12,88 --> 00:09:16,54
and of course it connects very directly with the Magna Carta

90
00:09:16,54 --> 00:09:20,73
and with the principles that have been derived from that instrument

91
00:09:20,73 --> 00:09:29,68
and I'll be saying much more about that in a few minutes rather more Institute activities include a great deal of

92
00:09:29,68 --> 00:09:31,75
outreach to the community.

93
00:09:32,18 --> 00:09:34,5
And particularly to schools

94
00:09:35,63 --> 00:09:44,3
and we have education officers who travel to schools in New South Wales in Queensland in Victoria South Australia so

95
00:09:44,3 --> 00:09:52,22
far. Maybe the rest of the country in times to come. Carrying the message of the role of war but also for this year.

96
00:09:52,23 --> 00:10:03,47
Of course the message of the Magna Carta. And we have had some wonderful events staged by. Our education. Officers.

97
00:10:03,87 --> 00:10:10,79
Nick Clark has here in the corner down there and Jackie who assists him

98
00:10:10,79 --> 00:10:18,42
and others who are brought in from time to time to assist and it's obviously very important.

99
00:10:18,43 --> 00:10:29,45
That high school students understand the foundational principles of our society as they learn history as they learn

100
00:10:29,45 --> 00:10:33,03
systems of government.

101
00:10:33,05 --> 00:10:40,01
And complete their education so on behalf of the Rule of Law Institute in particular the Magna Carta Committee.

102
00:10:40,27 --> 00:10:48,57
Welcome. Very pleased to be part of this event and we hope that you will find it a stimulating day and.

103
00:10:49,04 --> 00:10:54,63
To an extent reinforcement of many of those principles that we hold dear. Thank you.
