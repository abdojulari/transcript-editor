1
00:00:13,60 --> 00:00:14,88
Yep.

2
00:00:15,59 --> 00:00:17,41
Well in terms of that the early days

3
00:00:17,41 --> 00:00:21,74
and we were all pioneering
types who were sort of.

4
00:00:21,75 --> 00:00:26,13
You could claim credit classifies as
rugged individualists who strangely enough

5
00:00:26,13 --> 00:00:30,43
wanted to live together and
share their lives together and.

6
00:00:31,95 --> 00:00:34,16
One example of that was a local farmer

7
00:00:34,16 --> 00:00:38,41
but we made a range went with him where
we could grow company on his land

8
00:00:39,34 --> 00:00:41,19
and he would get some of
the company for his cattle

9
00:00:41,19 --> 00:00:45,54
and we would use the rest of it somehow
comfrey was going to be the miracle plant

10
00:00:45,54 --> 00:00:48,36
of the 70s and 80s or whatever and then.

11
00:00:49,30 --> 00:00:51,60
So we got there with our company
plants already planned out

12
00:00:51,60 --> 00:00:54,54
and he ploughed up the paddock so
it was loose and things like that

13
00:00:54,54 --> 00:00:56,94
and we started planning and then we.

14
00:00:56,96 --> 00:01:00,53
Then we realized we weren't sure how the
irrigation would work how all of this

15
00:01:01,33 --> 00:01:03,30
there runoff from his
daring on ascent and water

16
00:01:03,30 --> 00:01:07,88
and so on would get to each plant and
registering that paddock about 15

17
00:01:07,88 --> 00:01:11,49
or more of us all a different idea
of exactly how do you think asians

18
00:01:11,49 --> 00:01:16,97
and work for two hours just know
what to let go. Their particular.

19
00:01:16,99 --> 00:01:20,17
Idea that how irrigation
irrigating company should work.

20
00:01:21,36 --> 00:01:23,85
So i guess an idea of the sort of.

21
00:01:24,62 --> 00:01:28,80
And i suppose those were the early days
in terms of us understanding how group

22
00:01:28,80 --> 00:01:32,31
decisions work and all of that and
we were determined to use consensus

23
00:01:32,31 --> 00:01:35,72
but we didn't have a clear
idea of the processes

24
00:01:35,72 --> 00:01:39,17
that we could use to get to some
sort of decision so you know we.

25
00:01:40,05 --> 00:01:43,22
Just argued in the sun for two hours and.

26
00:01:43,66 --> 00:01:47,96
Until everyone got really really frustrated
i think and decided on something

27
00:01:47,96 --> 00:01:50,62
or maybe the farmer came along and
sorted it out. I can't remember.

28
00:01:51,74 --> 00:01:58,06
Anyway then. Oh yeah yeah. I mean we.

29
00:01:58,61 --> 00:01:59,50
In the early days.

30
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,45
Of course because we were just beginning
in there were a lot of decisions to be

31
00:02:02,45 --> 00:02:05,03
made and we didn't know
each other that well.

32
00:02:05,84 --> 00:02:09,36
But but also because we were
just beginning of that meeting

33
00:02:09,36 --> 00:02:14,91
and using in the same thing we met for
a full day every week. And meetings.

34
00:02:15,39 --> 00:02:17,09
We did have an agenda and things like that

35
00:02:17,09 --> 00:02:19,79
and gradually got the hang of
having one person to facilitate

36
00:02:19,79 --> 00:02:24,88
and take the role of guiding the
meeting and so on. Whereas these days.

37
00:02:25,00 --> 00:02:29,02
We meet for half a day maybe
only a few hours once a month.

38
00:02:29,72 --> 00:02:36,54
And so that's just there just a
change in our need to spend time in

39
00:02:36,54 --> 00:02:41,28
decision making that.

40
00:02:41,29 --> 00:02:44,17
And where were you before and.

41
00:02:45,30 --> 00:02:49,68
Oh yeah the changes or one
interesting thing that means saying

42
00:02:49,68 --> 00:02:52,06
that the early people
were pioneer learing.

43
00:02:53,47 --> 00:02:58,34
That's true of sort of the people that
came within the first four or five years

44
00:02:59,18 --> 00:03:00,75
and then there was a sort of a gap

45
00:03:01,96 --> 00:03:06,68
and a bunch of different sort of
people moved on after six or seven

46
00:03:06,68 --> 00:03:07,48
or eight years

47
00:03:07,48 --> 00:03:12,54
and these people saw a set up community
they saw water systems in the ground roads

48
00:03:12,55 --> 00:03:15,05
working as they were a
community that had its rules

49
00:03:15,05 --> 00:03:19,70
and structure as a way of making decisions
together set of friendships a power

50
00:03:19,70 --> 00:03:22,17
system happening. Established buildings.

51
00:03:22,74 --> 00:03:26,51
A whole way of life that they could
just move into great you know and

52
00:03:26,51 --> 00:03:32,65
and very cheap. And just
totally inviting and so.

53
00:03:32,67 --> 00:03:34,71
A different sort of
person. I'm not saying.

54
00:03:35,27 --> 00:03:38,24
In any way you know in fear
or anything like that.

55
00:03:39,61 --> 00:03:42,29
Lovely people and different and

56
00:03:42,29 --> 00:03:46,85
and that's caused a little bit of.

57
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:50,25
Not exactly friction

58
00:03:50,25 --> 00:03:54,99
but disgruntled with sometimes because the
advantage of being a pioneering person

59
00:03:54,99 --> 00:03:59,89
in some ways is that you're looking around
and looking at how things are going and.

60
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,32
In taking initiative really being
responsible for what they're out

61
00:04:04,06 --> 00:04:07,39
and really being engaged with
the land or the community.

62
00:04:07,41 --> 00:04:10,72
You know whether it's a process of
us being together our relationships

63
00:04:10,72 --> 00:04:13,35
or something that needs doing on the
land or a building that we might need

64
00:04:13,35 --> 00:04:17,18
or whatever. Whereas the sort of second
type of people if i can call them

65
00:04:17,18 --> 00:04:23,33
that i don't tend to engage
in that same way so easily.

66
00:04:23,46 --> 00:04:28,28
So it's taken from me just prompting people
saying hey if you want to contribute.

67
00:04:28,55 --> 00:04:31,77
How about building a visitor's house
that would be a great thing and things

68
00:04:31,77 --> 00:04:35,91
that they're immediately apparent to me
just weren't apparent to them because

69
00:04:35,91 --> 00:04:38,20
that all that set up and
their point of view.

70
00:04:38,97 --> 00:04:44,47
Whereas my vision is still
you know running amuck.

71
00:04:45,41 --> 00:04:47,29
And i imagine i'm not quite.

72
00:04:47,41 --> 00:04:49,32
Well i'm not quite sure
what i meant him but

73
00:04:50,52 --> 00:04:53,44
that will go it will go into some other
phases a little attract a different sort of

74
00:04:53,44 --> 00:04:54,96
person again and that will bring its own.

75
00:04:55,38 --> 00:04:57,84
Interesting dilemmas and compromises

76
00:04:57,84 --> 00:05:08,82
and so on.

77
00:05:12,84 --> 00:05:18,41
We decided in the early days part of
our idealism and more than idealism.

78
00:05:18,84 --> 00:05:23,01
And that no one here could own.

79
00:05:24,95 --> 00:05:30,15
Their house that they built. We don't
have shares we just have donations. And.

80
00:05:30,58 --> 00:05:34,45
You can't lie claim to anything except
what you can sort of carry off in your car

81
00:05:34,45 --> 00:05:39,14
more or less. And that's what
people have had to do people

82
00:05:39,14 --> 00:05:42,83
that have left have left. So
you can say with nothing.

83
00:05:43,10 --> 00:05:44,91
Although some have been
given money as well

84
00:05:45,63 --> 00:05:50,03
but basically the non ownership of
houses is our policy which means

85
00:05:50,03 --> 00:05:56,23
that we as a community may may give
some money to a departing member

86
00:05:56,23 --> 00:05:59,64
or may or might not and that was.

87
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:00,13
Part of

88
00:06:00,13 --> 00:06:03,61
that was idealism thinking well it wouldn't
be great to break down the structure of

89
00:06:03,61 --> 00:06:04,56
land

90
00:06:04,56 --> 00:06:09,61
and home ownership in australia because
it just seems to increase the gap between

91
00:06:09,61 --> 00:06:12,88
rich and poor and in course
lots of trauma in society

92
00:06:12,88 --> 00:06:16,17
and it seems wrong who you
know who says we can own land.

93
00:06:16,19 --> 00:06:18,89
What a ridiculous notion in a way.

94
00:06:18,91 --> 00:06:21,29
But it was also i think that well

95
00:06:21,29 --> 00:06:23,57
that would show you were really committed
if you come into this community.

96
00:06:23,58 --> 00:06:26,57
You knew in you that you
couldn't speculate on it.

97
00:06:27,90 --> 00:06:31,52
In fact it was worse than you couldn't
depend on walking away with anything at all.

98
00:06:31,87 --> 00:06:35,56
And so it. Meant the no
one would come here.

99
00:06:35,95 --> 00:06:37,72
Other than because i really
just wanted to live with us.

100
00:06:38,66 --> 00:06:43,54
Which seemed like a principal criterion
as far as i'm concerned both things the

101
00:06:43,54 --> 00:06:45,65
idealism and wanting to change the world

102
00:06:45,65 --> 00:06:48,81
and the practical thing of having
people who are committed but

103
00:06:48,82 --> 00:06:54,22
that has meant a lot of difficulty in
recent years with for example my ex-partner

104
00:06:55,30 --> 00:06:58,35
mother of my boys who more

105
00:06:58,36 --> 00:07:02,98
and more grew away from the community didn't
want to participate wanted to sort of

106
00:07:02,98 --> 00:07:08,14
ghostwriter whatever you'd say. And.

107
00:07:09,50 --> 00:07:12,88
And her non-participation really
began to annoy other people

108
00:07:12,88 --> 00:07:15,39
but how can you make someone
participate and so on.

109
00:07:17,16 --> 00:07:18,74
And she started saying
well i want to leave

110
00:07:18,74 --> 00:07:25,04
but i want money for the house
which we'd built together. And.

111
00:07:25,88 --> 00:07:27,27
We decided that was fair enough.

112
00:07:27,37 --> 00:07:31,07
And then a woman or a couple came
that really wanted to live here

113
00:07:31,07 --> 00:07:32,25
and they said yeah well
that's fair enough.

114
00:07:33,59 --> 00:07:38,15
We'll pay the community some money
for the privilege of living in

115
00:07:38,15 --> 00:07:40,09
that already built house and
not having to build one

116
00:07:40,09 --> 00:07:44,54
and the community can decide
whether pass it on to my ex

117
00:07:44,54 --> 00:07:47,85
and that's what happened.

118
00:07:48,93 --> 00:07:51,05
But people were very worried
about that setting a precedent

119
00:07:52,29 --> 00:07:55,23
but both as far as i'm concerned
both precedents have been set.

120
00:07:55,26 --> 00:07:56,52
You know people have
gone away with nothing

121
00:07:56,52 --> 00:07:59,82
and gone away with something so
it leaves the power in their.

122
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,97
As of the community which i'm really happy
with at the moment because i think we

123
00:08:04,97 --> 00:08:08,72
make decisions really well.
We do listen to each other.

124
00:08:08,81 --> 00:08:14,95
Carefully and spend time when there's
an important decision to be made and.

125
00:08:14,97 --> 00:08:18,70
So far of a lot of confidence in that
i'm well aware that it could go.

126
00:08:19,14 --> 00:08:24,13
Could go wrong when i'm not
quite sure how at the moment.

127
00:08:27,29 --> 00:08:33,25
You know. Well the legal
structure is that it be.

128
00:08:34,74 --> 00:08:38,35
From out from our lawyers solicitors point
of view it would be almost impossible

129
00:08:38,35 --> 00:08:41,24
persone one to take control
of the land and try

130
00:08:41,24 --> 00:08:44,66
and sell it from under us we've set
up a structure that is very confusing

131
00:08:44,66 --> 00:08:49,87
and very difficult to. To rort.

132
00:08:49,89 --> 00:08:54,68
But then in terms of sanctioning anyones
behaviour we have no we have nothing at

133
00:08:54,68 --> 00:08:55,86
all. Nothing legal at all.

134
00:08:56,09 --> 00:08:58,55
Whereas for example estrada
title or something like

135
00:08:58,55 --> 00:09:02,72
that does make all the rules
that a community might make up

136
00:09:02,72 --> 00:09:04,31
and the start of title
get fixed in the law

137
00:09:04,31 --> 00:09:06,82
and they can call in the police
to enforce it. We can't do that.

138
00:09:08,09 --> 00:09:14,89
And we feel a bit strange about
having to do that actually. But.

139
00:09:15,60 --> 00:09:21,75
Most. Yeah that's meant a lot to us.

140
00:09:24,16 --> 00:09:28,29
Of course there's been plenty of friction
between people and misunderstandings

141
00:09:28,29 --> 00:09:31,89
and hurt and anger and.

142
00:09:31,90 --> 00:09:36,64
And but there's this climate in which.

143
00:09:36,66 --> 00:09:41,30
Over time things get resolved
people to after the heat die down.

144
00:09:41,45 --> 00:09:44,87
They're going to talk to each other and
work things through and agree to disagree

145
00:09:44,87 --> 00:09:48,86
or whatever.

146
00:09:50,67 --> 00:09:54,32
And i think that's that's a
function of you know values.

147
00:09:54,68 --> 00:09:59,82
And just who happens to have come
here but it's also a function of a.

148
00:10:01,70 --> 00:10:07,36
Between thought.

149
00:10:08,44 --> 00:10:12,29
It's also a function of the
size of the group and.

150
00:10:13,06 --> 00:10:15,45
So we have 20 adults here
and with about 20 children.

151
00:10:18,01 --> 00:10:19,12
Which means about eight families.

152
00:10:19,82 --> 00:10:26,41
A lot of sole parent families and couples.

153
00:10:26,42 --> 00:10:32,70
And i think if it got up to about 30 adults
we'd find factions forming i'm fairly

154
00:10:32,71 --> 00:10:35,08
wary of that self and that and that's all.

155
00:10:35,21 --> 00:10:37,88
Also a great conflict because
there's a lot of lovely people.

156
00:10:38,03 --> 00:10:38,55
I'd love to come

157
00:10:38,55 --> 00:10:42,46
and live here people some some of whom i
feel much more affinity with than some of

158
00:10:42,46 --> 00:10:43,93
the members of that.

159
00:10:44,86 --> 00:10:51,29
So you know.

160
00:10:51,31 --> 00:10:57,90
Yeah. Ok. Well the first thing is.

161
00:10:59,75 --> 00:11:00,44
And and i made a start

162
00:11:00,44 --> 00:11:05,76
but a little bit men's movement as a name
is often in question i think it's worth

163
00:11:05,76 --> 00:11:09,64
questioning because it's not it's not like
a normal political movement with with a

164
00:11:09,64 --> 00:11:14,78
particular agenda and are not
in a political organization or.

165
00:11:14,80 --> 00:11:21,08
People joining in a marxism or
operative in parliament or something.

166
00:11:21,10 --> 00:11:22,68
It's more.

167
00:11:22,70 --> 00:11:26,85
And that's totally appropriate in what's
called the men's movement because.

168
00:11:26,87 --> 00:11:32,92
Because while women had to find
their strength and power in society

169
00:11:32,92 --> 00:11:34,60
and be able to stand up and be counted.

170
00:11:34,95 --> 00:11:41,35
So to speak and be paid properly and so on
to be respected men in general had that.

171
00:11:42,59 --> 00:11:46,47
What men didn't have was an
ability to be more introspective

172
00:11:46,47 --> 00:11:49,66
and see life as an energy as
much as an hour to achievement.

173
00:11:50,05 --> 00:11:53,95
And so a large

174
00:11:56,96 --> 00:11:59,55
mass specter of the
men's movement is more.

175
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,46
It's in a personal growth coming down
to what i understand oneself as a man

176
00:12:03,46 --> 00:12:08,30
and as a human and as a as being alive
on this wonderful planet. This time.

177
00:12:08,43 --> 00:12:10,70
And so on.

178
00:12:10,71 --> 00:12:14,52
So i've been involved
with working with men

179
00:12:14,52 --> 00:12:18,88
and being with with men in sort of
consciousness raising groups for about eight

180
00:12:18,88 --> 00:12:25,04
years. And that came out of.

181
00:12:25,06 --> 00:12:27,46
Running groups for.

182
00:12:27,48 --> 00:12:29,59
Called despair to empowerment groups

183
00:12:29,59 --> 00:12:33,95
that were particularly focusing on one's
emotional response to the state of the

184
00:12:33,95 --> 00:12:36,89
planet particularly the possibility
of nuclear war in those days.

185
00:12:38,66 --> 00:12:41,99
And that came out of just
being part of green protests

186
00:12:41,99 --> 00:12:48,58
and realizing that we needed
to know each other better

187
00:12:48,58 --> 00:12:52,32
and to communicate better to really protest
effectively so i started working with

188
00:12:52,32 --> 00:12:58,88
people and learning and training
and so on. Yep so. You know i.

189
00:13:01,92 --> 00:13:03,40
Know not not in particular.

190
00:13:05,64 --> 00:13:09,62
More this area not just this communities
are particularly social body farm

191
00:13:09,62 --> 00:13:12,35
communities particularly socially
and environmentally oriented

192
00:13:12,35 --> 00:13:15,06
and if you make a list of
all the projects people.

193
00:13:15,22 --> 00:13:18,13
Members have been involved in it's
really long and quite impressive

194
00:13:18,88 --> 00:13:21,99
but in terms of getting into.

195
00:13:22,66 --> 00:13:26,12
Working with men.

196
00:13:27,27 --> 00:13:28,97
There's one other man that
was living here at the time

197
00:13:28,97 --> 00:13:31,57
and sort of a member called ken and he

198
00:13:31,57 --> 00:13:38,33
and i had discussed how how women seem to
have having such a good time together in

199
00:13:38,33 --> 00:13:41,65
their in their groups and the workshops
they have that are women only

200
00:13:41,65 --> 00:13:43,15
and we were sort of envious and jealous

201
00:13:43,15 --> 00:13:45,55
and thought can men
really have friendships

202
00:13:45,55 --> 00:13:47,61
that say as close as women seem to be

203
00:13:47,61 --> 00:13:52,89
and you know that's what i was asking
myself can i have comradery with with men

204
00:13:52,89 --> 00:13:57,14
without having to go to war for it and
that was a real question i had no idea.

205
00:13:57,18 --> 00:13:59,15
I really wanted whether it was possible.

206
00:14:01,85 --> 00:14:05,36
So i think one of the first workshops we
organise which was a long weekend workshop

207
00:14:05,36 --> 00:14:06,93
was called the anzac weekend.

208
00:14:07,04 --> 00:14:11,12
Then the anzac within and it was
on with on the anzac day weekend.

209
00:14:11,14 --> 00:14:15,39
And when which we were particularly
looking at power and authority.

210
00:14:15,41 --> 00:14:18,31
So ken and i both having had
experience with designing

211
00:14:18,31 --> 00:14:21,51
and running workshops we designed one
particularly for men with all sorts of

212
00:14:21,51 --> 00:14:25,27
exercise that would bring these
issues up and we could discuss

213
00:14:25,27 --> 00:14:27,95
and discover more about ourselves as men

214
00:14:29,11 --> 00:14:32,10
and we had a bit time about
twenty five men came along

215
00:14:32,10 --> 00:14:36,32
and we put them through
all sorts of exercises

216
00:14:36,33 --> 00:14:40,15
and yeah.

217
00:14:40,17 --> 00:14:42,48
One of the principal exercises we used in

218
00:14:42,48 --> 00:14:46,83
that workshop which what we
called the circle of isolation.

219
00:14:47,86 --> 00:14:48,26
And it more

220
00:14:48,26 --> 00:14:53,03
or less was a reenactment just acting
out in a paddock what happens to a boy

221
00:14:54,00 --> 00:14:54,97
and a male as he grows up.

222
00:14:55,29 --> 00:15:00,60
So we've got first of all got some sort of
marching around militarily like you have

223
00:15:00,60 --> 00:15:03,74
to do at school or you might if
you went to cadets and so on

224
00:15:03,74 --> 00:15:05,57
and telling them off and so on

225
00:15:05,57 --> 00:15:09,36
and then we asked them to just sort
of miller around and break into pairs

226
00:15:09,36 --> 00:15:12,83
and look at each other. Look
look in each other's eyes

227
00:15:12,83 --> 00:15:15,77
and imagine the other person was a childhood
friend and how you felt about that

228
00:15:15,77 --> 00:15:19,45
and then break up again and
look in another man's eyes

229
00:15:19,45 --> 00:15:23,04
and imagining them to be the
teacher that bossed you around

230
00:15:24,07 --> 00:15:26,56
and then maybe the adolescent that

231
00:15:26,56 --> 00:15:31,61
that was a bully whatever we gradually
built up a picture of the of the

232
00:15:34,05 --> 00:15:36,34
different events in a in a male's life

233
00:15:36,34 --> 00:15:41,09
that tend to push drive them
into isolation drive them into

234
00:15:43,31 --> 00:15:45,81
having to take care of
themselves and not and

235
00:15:46,58 --> 00:15:50,37
and be wary of everyone else
especially other males.

236
00:15:50,39 --> 00:15:53,37
Which happens in all sorts
of overt and covert ways

237
00:15:54,31 --> 00:15:59,78
and then we got everyone to get in a
circle facing outwards to sort of.

238
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:00,39
What's circle

239
00:16:00,39 --> 00:16:05,43
and just start walking until you can no
longer see only just in your peripheral

240
00:16:05,43 --> 00:16:09,05
vision maybe you could see another
man however very wide circle

241
00:16:09,05 --> 00:16:13,72
and large paddock and ask them to feel
what that was like maybe express it

242
00:16:13,72 --> 00:16:16,56
and some men were weeping and others
were just yelling and screaming

243
00:16:16,56 --> 00:16:18,33
and others were just silent and

244
00:16:19,34 --> 00:16:23,89
and just standing there feeling it because
they'd been in the group we'd been

245
00:16:23,89 --> 00:16:25,42
sharing they walked away from it and

246
00:16:25,42 --> 00:16:29,97
that just sort of mirrored for us what it's
been like growing up from feeling close

247
00:16:29,97 --> 00:16:32,95
and accepted and small and
valued and being able to share

248
00:16:32,95 --> 00:16:37,46
and being able to emote and so on
to being a man where you isolate

249
00:16:37,46 --> 00:16:41,04
and you take care of yourself. You've got
to be in control and and you can't cry

250
00:16:41,04 --> 00:16:44,78
and so on. And quite a powerful exercise

251
00:16:44,78 --> 00:16:49,26
and we get men to turn around face each
other maybe make eye contact way across the

252
00:16:49,26 --> 00:16:51,57
paddock and start walking in
and see what that feels like

253
00:16:51,57 --> 00:16:56,05
and you know for myself although i felt
agony at being on the outside of the circle

254
00:16:56,05 --> 00:16:59,78
i also felt real apprehension at coming
back in closer because they were safe out

255
00:16:59,78 --> 00:17:04,25
there that's what i was used to. And.

256
00:17:05,03 --> 00:17:10,29
So we did sort of coming closer
and and there was joy in that

257
00:17:10,29 --> 00:17:13,01
and we we sang together
and i each other and so

258
00:17:13,01 --> 00:17:16,07
but you know that's one
one exercise that i can

259
00:17:16,07 --> 00:17:19,14
and i've often used in workshops since.

260
00:17:19,15 --> 00:17:22,53
Just to dramatically
illustrate what happens to me

261
00:17:22,53 --> 00:17:25,65
and to themselves because most
men don't even realize that.

262
00:17:26,23 --> 00:17:30,58
That's happened i didn't like it's a process
of like a fish discovering what water

263
00:17:30,58 --> 00:17:38,11
is.

264
00:17:40,29 --> 00:17:44,11
Well that's why i can't say that's really
a movement it's just it's just a whole

265
00:17:44,11 --> 00:17:47,80
lot of different men that
are quite interested in.

266
00:17:47,82 --> 00:17:51,78
Well they might come out of a broken up
relationship with something realizing

267
00:17:51,78 --> 00:17:53,70
that no one to talk to and their partner.

268
00:17:54,91 --> 00:17:56,58
Has lots of support

269
00:17:57,56 --> 00:17:59,84
or they might really think you know
i'd like to be friends with men.

270
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:06,27
Not have this sort of stand off
beer in hand relationship. And.

271
00:18:07,78 --> 00:18:12,04
In terms of it. And so it's. I don't
know what to say about it in this area.

272
00:18:12,28 --> 00:18:16,30
There's a lot of men most of whom you
know each other because it's only a small

273
00:18:16,30 --> 00:18:19,10
group so far only be a couple of hundred.

274
00:18:19,12 --> 00:18:23,41
Who are willing who really want to look at
themselves as men understand themselves

275
00:18:23,41 --> 00:18:23,97
as men

276
00:18:23,97 --> 00:18:29,28
and find out what it is to be a man in you
know in our generation because everything

277
00:18:29,29 --> 00:18:35,64
else has been the old roles has been ripped
away from itself of being the provider

278
00:18:35,64 --> 00:18:37,75
and so on and even the protector.

279
00:18:37,77 --> 00:18:40,44
We can't easily be because
that involves going to war

280
00:18:40,44 --> 00:18:41,75
and a kind of a without any more.

281
00:18:41,91 --> 00:18:45,88
So i can no longer be a provider
or protect anything necessarily

282
00:18:46,93 --> 00:18:49,02
and way back before that
the industrial revolution

283
00:18:49,02 --> 00:18:55,15
and so i ripped away the ancient traditions
of what it was to be a man a past on

284
00:18:55,15 --> 00:18:56,15
heritage that we've sort of more

285
00:18:56,15 --> 00:19:00,67
or less lost was women's i think has
been more intact because from mother to

286
00:19:00,67 --> 00:19:04,08
daughter mothers and daughters tended
to stay at home and share things with.

287
00:19:04,43 --> 00:19:05,95
Men as soon as they got old enough

288
00:19:05,95 --> 00:19:08,47
or out working in the factories
the apprenticeship system.

289
00:19:08,65 --> 00:19:11,45
Perhaps kept up a bit of the old
traditions of what it is to be and then

290
00:19:11,45 --> 00:19:13,88
but that's broken down
these days as well so.

291
00:19:15,05 --> 00:19:17,99
So it's refining and also just
making up for ourselves what.

292
00:19:18,57 --> 00:19:20,46
What sort of relationships
we want when each other.

293
00:19:20,47 --> 00:19:21,97
Let's try them sort of

294
00:19:21,97 --> 00:19:27,13
and that's been a fantastic thing to be
involved with i love nearly every moment of

295
00:19:27,13 --> 00:19:30,43
it. I really enjoy it.

296
00:19:30,43 --> 00:19:35,57
Of being part of all facilitating men's
groups just weekly groups where particular

297
00:19:35,57 --> 00:19:39,57
thing might be used.

298
00:19:39,72 --> 00:19:44,24
You know like father
either being a father or.

299
00:19:44,26 --> 00:19:50,68
Father father in law or
one's own father or mother

300
00:19:50,68 --> 00:19:54,76
or sex or sex and intimacy

301
00:19:56,62 --> 00:20:03,47
or work or. Right. It untold number of
themes we can used as a discussion point.

302
00:20:03,49 --> 00:20:04,93
And there's a lot of exercises

303
00:20:04,93 --> 00:20:10,22
and things we can do together to have
fun to get to know each other better.

304
00:20:12,63 --> 00:20:15,50
Come.

305
00:20:17,42 --> 00:20:22,94
Yeah that's greater with a lot of suspicion
because there's rampant fear in men of

306
00:20:22,94 --> 00:20:26,11
getting closer because they've been trained
not to be so they get very angry if

307
00:20:26,11 --> 00:20:29,94
they see other mean doing what
they were told not to be so and

308
00:20:29,94 --> 00:20:34,91
that generally quits gets called homophobia
which is you know me if i be a is a

309
00:20:34,91 --> 00:20:38,91
sort of misnomer that's generally
supposed to mean fear of gay men

310
00:20:38,91 --> 00:20:41,09
but i think it's really
fear of each other.

311
00:20:41,10 --> 00:20:47,17
Fear fear of other men in general i mean
especially fear of any man a term that's

312
00:20:47,17 --> 00:20:50,01
all. And quite happy being
uncomfortable being close

313
00:20:50,01 --> 00:20:55,12
and talking about intimate things
with you and so there's that reaction

314
00:20:55,12 --> 00:20:55,96
and there's all.

315
00:20:56,17 --> 00:21:03,52
I personally i've had very
little almost no criticism from.

316
00:21:04,34 --> 00:21:11,25
Women about what i do and i know other
men that have so i think it's. And.

317
00:21:12,99 --> 00:21:18,49
I'm not sure why that is
that i'm quite. You know i.

318
00:21:18,50 --> 00:21:23,85
In terms of feminism on really feel. I.

319
00:21:23,87 --> 00:21:26,67
I were great debt to feminist
thinkers and all the women

320
00:21:26,67 --> 00:21:29,89
that have put their lives in
their family and and so on.

321
00:21:29,91 --> 00:21:35,30
On the line to make changes in our
society the sacrifices they've made and

322
00:21:36,65 --> 00:21:40,59
and still i also react to some elements
of feminism where there seems to be a

323
00:21:40,59 --> 00:21:41,59
bitterness against men

324
00:21:41,59 --> 00:21:46,84
that i would call sort of sexist because
there's this generalized generalized

325
00:21:46,84 --> 00:21:49,36
distrust which i can understand but

326
00:21:49,37 --> 00:21:54,37
when i'm talking with a thinking woman
i expected her to rise above that

327
00:21:55,49 --> 00:21:59,32
and but i've rarely come across that
bitterness aimed directly at me.

328
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,66
In what i do mostly there's
incredible support because women.

329
00:22:05,55 --> 00:22:11,08
Seem to be able to see much more easily
than men can what influences are on men

330
00:22:11,08 --> 00:22:14,42
from birth and also how men behave
so admirably because of them.

331
00:22:14,62 --> 00:22:20,18
So i do teach men's issues in tape
sometimes in other places and.

332
00:22:20,20 --> 00:22:24,46
And you know the way i like to teach this
is just actually draw out other people's

333
00:22:24,46 --> 00:22:24,81
experiences

334
00:22:24,81 --> 00:22:30,86
and women can talk much more easily about
what i would call men's oppression than

335
00:22:30,87 --> 00:22:33,97
the men in general in the classes.

336
00:22:33,99 --> 00:22:38,80
And then it can be quite a painful
topic for quite a few people to do so.

337
00:22:38,95 --> 00:22:44,47
So the different the response is i think
mainly out of one's personal pain in the

338
00:22:44,47 --> 00:22:47,99
area of gender. It goes back generations.

339
00:22:48,01 --> 00:22:51,42
What with different genders are
sort of done to each other.

340
00:22:51,52 --> 00:23:02,59
Expected to be gender.

341
00:23:03,43 --> 00:23:07,65
You know. Oh. We.

342
00:23:08,01 --> 00:23:11,85
We didn't ever set ourselves out to be
self-sufficient in vegetables and fruit

343
00:23:11,85 --> 00:23:13,85
or whatever with that was never.

344
00:23:13,87 --> 00:23:19,03
Although we called body farm where we
really more accurately call us body village

345
00:23:19,03 --> 00:23:19,69
or something like that.

346
00:23:19,86 --> 00:23:25,69
So that's a great relief i think it's a bit
of a mistake to put so much effort into

347
00:23:25,69 --> 00:23:30,45
something for what to me is a fairly sort
of a shallow goal to be self-sufficient

348
00:23:30,45 --> 00:23:34,04
not rather be integrated and i think
most people here would rather feel

349
00:23:34,04 --> 00:23:36,65
that they're making a difference
to society as a whole

350
00:23:36,65 --> 00:23:40,30
and therefore a part of
society rather than.

351
00:23:40,32 --> 00:23:45,70
Going outside somehow and
trying to be separate. So yeah.

352
00:23:46,90 --> 00:23:49,32
For myself having young twins

353
00:23:49,32 --> 00:23:51,20
and getting a portrait together
of course i went on the dole

354
00:23:51,20 --> 00:23:55,01
and many of us did to survive and.

355
00:23:55,61 --> 00:23:59,58
I suppose a critic might say why don't you
go out get a job in the money come back

356
00:23:59,58 --> 00:24:00,62
and then do. The pottery and so on

357
00:24:00,62 --> 00:24:04,91
but i just was so motivated to get
this community up and running.

358
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:09,02
I didn't want to leave it for a moment. I
really wanted to be part of it every day.

359
00:24:10,66 --> 00:24:14,45
And and that meant.

360
00:24:14,46 --> 00:24:18,07
You know i couldn't earn money just being
there until i got the pottery up such as

361
00:24:18,07 --> 00:24:22,93
me living there and being on the dole
and i got kicked off the dole more

362
00:24:22,93 --> 00:24:23,34
or less for

363
00:24:23,34 --> 00:24:26,69
that attitude i suppose in those days
they weren't encouraging people to set up

364
00:24:26,69 --> 00:24:27,75
businesses of their own

365
00:24:28,62 --> 00:24:32,55
and so really before i'd finished the pottery
buildings to my satisfaction to make

366
00:24:32,55 --> 00:24:38,07
an efficient. Sort of factory.
I got kicked off and.

367
00:24:39,23 --> 00:24:44,44
We went on again. That's my partner and i.
Few months later because we just had to.

368
00:24:44,54 --> 00:24:46,30
You know her name.

369
00:24:47,04 --> 00:24:51,95
So social security is has really been
enabled our community get to get up

370
00:24:51,95 --> 00:24:56,94
and running as quickly as it
has to be very hard to to.

371
00:24:56,96 --> 00:25:03,61
China and money and build this place as
well and we feel well we can justify

372
00:25:03,61 --> 00:25:06,46
that in the sense that well at least
we're constructing something with

373
00:25:06,46 --> 00:25:09,49
that money from the government if you
like something of lasting importance

374
00:25:09,49 --> 00:25:12,12
and so now not so many people on the dole.

375
00:25:12,28 --> 00:25:17,78
I think anyone maybe there was a small
business there. I had the pottery going.

376
00:25:18,11 --> 00:25:19,83
I couldn't say it was very lucrative

377
00:25:19,83 --> 00:25:24,22
and there was another business here
called effortless trading which we were

378
00:25:25,14 --> 00:25:28,94
importing things from india and also
making up facial creams and massager well

379
00:25:28,94 --> 00:25:33,46
and that that was supporting some people.

380
00:25:34,56 --> 00:25:39,80
But besides that they've been no
real industries. On the community.

381
00:25:40,62 --> 00:25:42,50
People have gone out to work.

382
00:25:43,50 --> 00:25:47,37
And that's how it is now most people
working in lismore or the area

383
00:25:47,37 --> 00:25:50,79
and teaching a whole range
of different things.

384
00:25:55,50 --> 00:25:59,94
The body parts. Yeah all the body
though do you means synonymous with a.

385
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:02,96
The lightman door understanding or
the truth or something like that.

386
00:26:04,01 --> 00:26:08,27
And so in our more arrogant moments we can
call ourselves farmers of enlightenment

387
00:26:08,27 --> 00:26:12,12
but you know i sort of ship it or
shrink into myself saying that

388
00:26:12,86 --> 00:26:14,27
but you know in some ways you could say

389
00:26:14,27 --> 00:26:17,32
that you know we've we've
helped start pre-schools

390
00:26:17,32 --> 00:26:21,49
and forest.

391
00:26:21,50 --> 00:26:28,28
Saving organizations and. Home birthing.
Things and heart politics conferences and.

392
00:26:29,48 --> 00:26:33,80
All manner of things. So
in that way in terms of.

393
00:26:34,34 --> 00:26:37,46
Relative enlightenment perhaps we've
helped along the way a little bit.

394
00:26:37,49 --> 00:26:43,06
You know we're what with the angle
of your question you know just

395
00:26:43,06 --> 00:26:49,84
but if i'm right. You know
it's a nice clean name.

396
00:26:50,54 --> 00:26:54,99
You know it's just short
term increase. And.

397
00:26:55,00 --> 00:26:57,12
I think most people here
are sort of proud of it

398
00:26:57,12 --> 00:27:01,23
and there is such i think is group morale
and how good you feel about the place

399
00:27:01,23 --> 00:27:04,15
and which includes when you feel
about the name an image that we have

400
00:27:05,35 --> 00:27:08,94
and generally we do feel good about it.
We've been criticized by the more feral.

401
00:27:10,84 --> 00:27:13,35
When you say hippies in the
hills as being middle class

402
00:27:13,35 --> 00:27:17,74
and to which one of our members said middle
class upper class think you know just

403
00:27:17,74 --> 00:27:23,35
taking anything out of it but.
But. And that's because we.

404
00:27:23,36 --> 00:27:27,49
I don't know we have had
slightly different values then.

405
00:27:27,50 --> 00:27:32,50
You could say the alternative
society in general.

406
00:27:32,52 --> 00:27:35,83
Because we haven't had dope on the place.

407
00:27:35,85 --> 00:27:40,53
And we've been you know part of running
is meditation retreats and so on.

408
00:27:40,57 --> 00:27:43,02
So sometimes we've been
criticized as being pure

409
00:27:43,02 --> 00:27:44,83
and things you know ridiculous things like

410
00:27:44,83 --> 00:27:59,43
that.

411
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,25
Yeah. Well most people here on body farm.

412
00:28:04,95 --> 00:28:09,43
Are well aware of the situation in
the world where. Basically that.

413
00:28:11,05 --> 00:28:14,95
The west lives on the back of third world.

414
00:28:14,96 --> 00:28:19,40
And through the institution
of third world debt and

415
00:28:20,37 --> 00:28:23,85
and differing prices for commodities
and people's labor and so on.

416
00:28:25,84 --> 00:28:29,48
And we also well aware that there's
limited resources in the world

417
00:28:29,48 --> 00:28:33,86
and not not everyone can be brought up
to a western standard with a car fridge.

418
00:28:34,09 --> 00:28:39,33
You know. All the things that
we enjoy in this country.

419
00:28:39,34 --> 00:28:45,29
Just the the environment groaning
bearing that it at the moment

420
00:28:45,29 --> 00:28:46,88
and possibly falling apart.

421
00:28:46,90 --> 00:28:50,22
Let alone as we bring all of india and
china and so on up to that standard.

422
00:28:51,45 --> 00:28:58,27
So the only way in terms of that environmental
outlook on a global outlook to.

423
00:28:58,29 --> 00:29:05,21
Look to for life to be sustainable on this
planet is for people to expectations in

424
00:29:05,21 --> 00:29:08,69
their lifestyles to drop a bit and say
we've sort of consciously done that

425
00:29:09,68 --> 00:29:10,90
but on the other side of that is

426
00:29:10,90 --> 00:29:16,77
that it's just like jesus said it's easier
for a camel to hop through the eye of a

427
00:29:16,77 --> 00:29:19,91
needle in the least for richmond to get
into heaven is it the truth in that is

428
00:29:19,91 --> 00:29:26,13
that too many material possessions clutter
your clutter your inner life tend to

429
00:29:26,13 --> 00:29:29,79
make you attached to things and
therefore it's not so easy to change

430
00:29:29,79 --> 00:29:34,29
and move with way where you need to
go in on your spiritual journey. And.

431
00:29:35,62 --> 00:29:39,23
So those two values sort of intermingle
with each other the global perspective in

432
00:29:39,23 --> 00:29:45,15
the spiritual perspective to mean
that. And then come down to.

433
00:29:45,17 --> 00:29:49,49
That there is some benefit in
having a simpler lifestyle.

434
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:51,55
Less material possessions

435
00:29:51,55 --> 00:29:59,44
and less pressured lifestyle.

436
00:30:02,56 --> 00:30:06,21
So i don't consider. I
consider myself pretty rich.

437
00:30:06,41 --> 00:30:13,21
I been thinking about this recently
because i've been working in taste.

438
00:30:13,23 --> 00:30:15,02
And just thinking about
other people's lives.

439
00:30:15,05 --> 00:30:19,57
Compared to my own where i don't i don't
have very many overheads true i don't own

440
00:30:19,57 --> 00:30:22,06
my house but i'm not paying
out anything on it either

441
00:30:22,06 --> 00:30:25,24
and anything i build onto it
just stays there for many years

442
00:30:25,24 --> 00:30:32,22
and so my wage goes a lot
further than other people's my

443
00:30:32,22 --> 00:30:35,45
who are renting or paying off a mortgage
or whatever let alone running two cars

444
00:30:35,45 --> 00:30:39,83
and buying the newest gadget.

445
00:30:39,84 --> 00:30:43,87
So i consider myself fairly wealthy basically
because i'm pretty happy with what

446
00:30:43,87 --> 00:30:45,79
i've got but but more than

447
00:30:45,79 --> 00:30:50,56
that because i have instead of putting all
my work into superannuation and so on.

448
00:30:50,59 --> 00:30:52,90
I put it into everything
a community around me

449
00:30:52,90 --> 00:30:56,46
and my security isn't the money
so much as the people in my life.

450
00:30:57,43 --> 00:31:00,46
And time will tell which
one is the better bet.

451
00:31:00,49 --> 00:31:06,96
I don't know but for the
moment i much prefer this one.

452
00:31:07,77 --> 00:31:08,54
Ok thank you.
