1
00:00:01,41 --> 00:00:04,66
This is a. She's a few years old.

2
00:00:04,76 --> 00:00:16,74
One night I got rather friendly with you know just very very very we would meet every night just so I did all the

3
00:00:16,74 --> 00:00:31,46
really cold calling for a hotel called the National this is a prison reserve and that was the life they are with us.

4
00:00:31,54 --> 00:00:32,68
I think for supplies

5
00:00:32,68 --> 00:00:45,86
and I would like for them to garrison the city was right there for the rest of the game so we got very good.

6
00:00:46,00 --> 00:01:16,23
There was certainly it was like there's a degree there when you're ready when you hear little

7
00:01:16,23 --> 00:01:34,31
or nothing at all that for a little more special mission. Yes they sure will be there for years here obviously.

8
00:01:34,64 --> 00:01:42,16
Oh but there will likely make the rounds on a Friday night.

9
00:01:42,49 --> 00:02:00,5
Mainly out of that out this year and a very good one of the process.

10
00:02:02,14 --> 00:02:20,01
The trouble with going without a year of our early years was before that you know there will be guys like here.

11
00:02:21,32 --> 00:02:35,47
Yes and I don't know whether they're going to get sixty. But it was a balance. Yes yes.

12
00:02:35,69 --> 00:02:40,65
Obviously they're quite rich occasion right for the manager

13
00:02:40,65 --> 00:02:46,04
and there's really days I'm sitting there I used to do it all my life I think people are just crazy.

14
00:02:46,43 --> 00:02:55,76
They just will go if you're real sure you get House is going to turn your head back

15
00:02:55,76 --> 00:03:13,24
and you're kind of dazed you're right now let's have a little bit of news for you over here just to which one can reach

16
00:03:13,24 --> 00:03:25,15
their goal or in the foyer or the luxury.

17
00:03:25,19 --> 00:03:33,73
This was all in the toilets Yes and sometimes you guys don't often use that you're in the same line as you

18
00:03:33,73 --> 00:03:39,67
and that sort of Hawker around the back like the way you sat or you really you just get it.

19
00:03:39,78 --> 00:03:54,6
It's a rather isolated actually one spot of the where people of the men are worrying here with us where there was

20
00:03:54,6 --> 00:04:01,63
result news something to die here used to be a fire her. I still get it.

21
00:04:02,44 --> 00:04:15,28
And yes they do the heavy programs lasting a bit of a null reacquire around re-arrest the state gives you a list

22
00:04:15,28 --> 00:04:26,22
and you get your share just blew it was a book called the leader. It was a joy to know you're here.

23
00:04:26,37 --> 00:04:32,69
She told me right here where I see you haven't been real. It was.

24
00:04:32,73 --> 00:04:36,88
Yes I think it was years ahead of me yeah that's right. You sort of got to be there.

25
00:04:36,88 --> 00:04:55,95
While I was down in the little chilly New York and the roads around the world.

26
00:04:56,09 --> 00:05:07,44
I don't know where I was I was having a theory let's imagine. Let's just say well it really.

27
00:05:07,75 --> 00:05:11,04
Let's see you there actually are living journalists.

28
00:05:11,12 --> 00:05:28,71
A really rough day here a year like cyclists did here first year of their right to have a look at your options.

29
00:05:28,87 --> 00:05:37,19
While the first letter to the point is women do it all right. It's just you're right.

30
00:05:37,29 --> 00:05:44,85
I mean women had the same sort of experience as I said Really.

31
00:05:45,32 --> 00:05:52,55
But both started work here because of the way right now well over your daughter says

32
00:05:52,55 --> 00:05:59,43
and he resists she's got a lot of things she really very good one called a chariot here. Well three in the war.

33
00:06:01,01 --> 00:06:09,33
Very true. You know.

34
00:06:09,38 --> 00:06:36,96
Well you know the psychologically difficult right here because I don't believe the life really was that

35
00:06:36,96 --> 00:07:06,25
when I was in my early. I really doubt it was sort of like I was just here that we were there for that.

36
00:07:07,01 --> 00:07:24,68
We always go back for such a good run.

37
00:07:24,72 --> 00:08:00,82
Just what you want to do is a sure thing you can't lose your chorus boy boy old girl. The least little of course boys.

38
00:08:01,77 --> 00:08:06,45
Of course Boy I mean this is a rather coarse boys who are good but here is the chorus.

39
00:08:07,06 --> 00:08:14,69
I didn't think about because I really didn't have much of a scene or dancing is brutal or The very quickly

40
00:08:15,39 --> 00:08:31,48
and he was hoping to become the last person you know but he was a he used to love your wife here as a window person

41
00:08:34,07 --> 00:08:39,26
and he hats princes for older you probably come over.

42
00:08:39,26 --> 00:08:56,00
Hopefully Michael floral hats design tires for recreates or better their outfits and they can be here for the right.

43
00:08:56,01 --> 00:09:09,31
Task or strong you must be hard to go all the extra time.

44
00:09:09,43 --> 00:09:16,25
OK Yes well there it was my grandchild was the children's author but they were suppressed.

45
00:09:16,39 --> 00:09:26,82
Yet there was a right never wrong a great certainly won't get it right the Riddick got it right with it because they

46
00:09:26,82 --> 00:09:28,84
are extremely amusing very quickly

47
00:09:28,84 --> 00:09:40,65
and they're a shock to your columns for sure because they will say well he was always there was new really real.

48
00:09:40,71 --> 00:10:00,83
Well it was fun to say progress not really use it but he would never do about science.

49
00:10:01,07 --> 00:10:25,21
If you didn't hear it was well I didn't hear it for three or youngster you know I was a youngster in the street kid

50
00:10:25,21 --> 00:10:31,6
and he measured the road has never had much money there not a rigid rule.

51
00:10:31,82 --> 00:10:37,68
Nary had much money in those days and he didn't like he did like thirty year old girl.

52
00:10:38,39 --> 00:10:43,22
So he planted all over the place here a race.

53
00:10:43,76 --> 00:10:51,05
We got out of here and he changed all that for every tree you see and then he invited the land.

54
00:10:51,33 --> 00:10:54,76
He used to call North after they didn't like it.

55
00:10:54,8 --> 00:11:06,16
No theory because I think you just don't want to hear that you're cut it off which he had done everything like title of

56
00:11:06,16 --> 00:11:12,66
the radio everything so that business is a relay race

57
00:11:12,66 --> 00:11:30,34
and I didn't get struck in the day I didn't have a reason coming and I didn't say right. Please you to do that.

58
00:11:30,37 --> 00:11:39,53
Get away with us now that I'm like you but you never read Iris.

59
00:11:39,77 --> 00:11:55,45
But there you might say she didn't have very right here at the Sunday night was nice to meet a friend of mine down

60
00:11:55,45 --> 00:12:03,25
there with me before. All right. Hotel hall then boy.

61
00:12:03,5 --> 00:12:12,22
Tell me just a little bit more about we would have to cram into the city close to six we would go from we get up to the

62
00:12:12,22 --> 00:12:23,49
route so we didn't pay anything you know later the failures and the child does not come back to you as you see it

63
00:12:23,49 --> 00:12:26,24
and then we walk along the coast to the Capitol.

64
00:12:26,25 --> 00:12:27,92
We went into the California

65
00:12:27,92 --> 00:12:38,42
and you're just expose you get a couple of weeks ago that I have a copy of it's maybe numerals Cleary But we said the

66
00:12:38,42 --> 00:12:44,35
cup of coffee and Joe the waitress and giving us a refill retreated

67
00:12:44,35 --> 00:12:54,32
and that will take us right through to all of our old law from from all that well you know that.

68
00:12:54,33 --> 00:13:02,02
Was I mean then you would drift from table to table you say oh excuse me I did this for my kids every time you trade

69
00:13:02,02 --> 00:13:03,24
your way through all the tables

70
00:13:03,24 --> 00:13:11,45
and you drop your friend there they say there for a while then you see somebody else for the overall a good review was

71
00:13:11,45 --> 00:13:17,97
a real social life you ran from table to table that you contact eventually if your original table then at about ten

72
00:13:17,97 --> 00:13:24,86
o'clock at night believe that we would walk along down William Street again walking down the side of the top.

73
00:13:25,24 --> 00:13:29,87
But being recklessly raised over the heads for nearly two cups of coffee.

74
00:13:30,15 --> 00:13:42,42
We would start the fish shop right sticks a vision everybody knows was really Street and across to we knew we ha ha ha.

75
00:13:42,57 --> 00:13:49,42
And I was six and that was there that I did that week after week after week.

76
00:13:49,6 --> 00:13:58,98
I thought it was mild the sort that was living up to the very you know they're there on the radio runs and.

77
00:14:01,2 --> 00:14:02,99
Running from your career

78
00:14:03,02 --> 00:14:13,13
but what about this time you were the one Mexico where to lay everything you're doing your job that he did he was going

79
00:14:13,13 --> 00:14:24,32
in for he was the one who did it he was a great deal because he was the one do kind of yeah yeah I'm what it was all

80
00:14:24,32 --> 00:14:32,24
the rest of it. Oh while we are on the right road well just around about this time I hear folks.

81
00:14:32,41 --> 00:14:40,77
I just carried you in Sydney. The first time while we're here and I said to this friend.

82
00:14:40,79 --> 00:14:50,61
There's no one I should make this and we have no real way of working here. So he said I wish you could tell.

83
00:14:50,8 --> 00:15:01,68
So I said How are you a story just in the oriental way up today but it was just me until it drops.

84
00:15:01,88 --> 00:15:09,16
Yes but next time and Beryl recently Canberra or it was up the Orient and he came out to set up a jury.

85
00:15:09,19 --> 00:15:15,8
He said to get a number two very thoughtful jury has Mr Garrick and the other of my purse.

86
00:15:15,86 --> 00:15:21,94
So you every bit as if to put this list of the crew here

87
00:15:21,94 --> 00:15:29,18
and I was just to get ready because all of that actually hear what he was about six eight hours was there.

88
00:15:29,18 --> 00:15:31,86
Always a letter. Yes but you know very happy.

89
00:15:31,88 --> 00:15:44,14
I mean I was pretty he was there was debris to get a record there's a buring hung classic was you get your good really

90
00:15:44,14 --> 00:15:56,3
really having a suit or a rest and he was over there were probably. Well I was very caring person.

91
00:16:01,21 --> 00:16:22,74
This was a couple people. No one. Yeah yeah yeah I know you say gay people disagree with you.

92
00:16:23,18 --> 00:16:35,48
This is a shame you need to be family. The right people with any moral issues so to say people aren't around for a bit.

93
00:16:36,06 --> 00:16:44,89
I got a bit worried about summer when you discuss it with your friends I mean you're looking at you

94
00:16:45,68 --> 00:17:05,75
and as you might actually be very good go out there while I'm sitting right there was a little bit little bit so you

95
00:17:06,22 --> 00:17:07,31
hear the truth.

96
00:17:07,69 --> 00:17:23,26
I mean yeah yeah yeah I mean what do you know you hear a guy like that where people hear through this man

97
00:17:23,74 --> 00:17:30,47
but I also think the fans are you a lot of the way that I fly while they're already. Oh yeah.

98
00:17:31,11 --> 00:17:34,79
You told me that they would get up in here

99
00:17:35,07 --> 00:18:00,9
and they would make us a lot of people were just trying to be sort of physical there right here there.

100
00:18:01,67 --> 00:18:03,2
After he left my dream

101
00:18:04,49 --> 00:18:13,91
and part of his US business to this company was much more I just spent a lot of time his company

102
00:18:13,91 --> 00:18:22,29
and I was always full of some left with very little to do and I thought.

103
00:18:23,65 --> 00:18:37,87
I know now about the guys on who knows what drives one with her own life and I stood on the corner.

104
00:18:39,88 --> 00:18:47,1
Well it was because school knew that that was very very nice to stand because that was the most obvious place to stand

105
00:18:47,1 --> 00:18:47,84
where it was.

106
00:18:48,9 --> 00:19:07,14
I know because Russell has slid very long young very young so I was originally you know I don't even know who he did he

107
00:19:07,14 --> 00:19:18,93
says you know myself and he sang lead gets the record

108
00:19:19,72 --> 00:19:23,8
and I very carefully actually read that because he's from looking my way

109
00:19:24,68 --> 00:19:29,08
and I'm very very he went up to it was a whole other target area but I did

110
00:19:30,23 --> 00:19:41,59
and he said oh how he said I was afraid my house was dark and the sight of it had a little higher

111
00:19:41,59 --> 00:19:48,91
and higher come out from Congressman miles driven see her I said well you know if you look at all.

112
00:19:49,22 --> 00:19:51,97
Dolly that he's sort of very already located.

113
00:19:52,27 --> 00:20:00,82
You never really know our youngest son just where he should be and he was.

114
00:20:01,35 --> 00:20:04,54
What should I know is how to handle a case about short and.

115
00:20:05,78 --> 00:20:16,27
A list goes on forever and you missed the foreign tourist he was in another prison like my dad and half life over.

116
00:20:16,69 --> 00:20:17,59
I guess life.

117
00:20:18,28 --> 00:20:21,92
I picked up a bit of rock tried to just come out of his

118
00:20:21,92 --> 00:20:32,16
and what he's done for the night of the best I was that he was a was at his house the best was great and him

119
00:20:32,57 --> 00:20:33,8
and began chatting to me

120
00:20:33,8 --> 00:20:41,9
and then eventually this very seedy Carrie came along with all that much of the world outside Tracy

121
00:20:42,47 --> 00:20:52,44
and I'll say this is my story and I'll resign Rouse rather than tell you that I was around

122
00:20:52,69 --> 00:20:57,99
and we went on to work with mystery man

123
00:21:00,17 --> 00:21:12,38
and players that were rough like it was the latest example there's not a lot of this bone was Joe exactly the first

124
00:21:12,38 --> 00:21:14,31
glance that once saw the picture of the camp.

125
00:21:14,64 --> 00:21:27,57
Oh yes I'm sure and I'm sure she was still there but that was my first introduction to do anything right here

126
00:21:28,15 --> 00:21:40,79
and your magic was right around the forty five sixty three area here. I don't know of another friend.

127
00:21:44,78 --> 00:21:53,14
I mean he didn't cite where would I let me run off quite a bit like it was with Ralph actually

128
00:21:53,14 --> 00:21:59,81
but I left like well the night.

129
00:22:00,99 --> 00:22:36,11
Just brought along with me to carry the bags I love to run right through your place here here here.

130
00:22:37,26 --> 00:22:57,3
The other place was a new restaurant that was right in the right players the other players parties together.

131
00:22:58,27 --> 00:23:34,59
Did you know her well your very soul she talked about why she was just like you really really you do you know you

132
00:23:35,39 --> 00:23:59,68
really really really really really come this year. Roses there she was like that's like a year old just like shopping.

133
00:23:59,78 --> 00:24:10,02
Wasn't it. Feeling like oh late late night shopping shopping at Star Wars when you're exactly right. Probably not yet.

134
00:24:11,23 --> 00:24:17,27
And yeah never said a morning your good reason to worry your sure sure.

135
00:24:17,48 --> 00:24:27,48
Trouble you eat hair right there actually right here got this right here.

136
00:24:27,59 --> 00:24:39,9
So he writes what he writes and says shit he or she cannot go on result she got a lawyer skewed or a really long one.

137
00:24:40,01 --> 00:25:00,13
Yes look it up for a living off course it will help Eastern European countries. Here's a story here.

138
00:25:00,38 --> 00:25:17,4
That was really fun. This is because it was a guy you will. I think it must be she's a bit like life as in the rest.

139
00:25:17,44 --> 00:25:20,98
You know it's obvious you know the I guess a restaurant.

140
00:25:21,09 --> 00:25:25,34
You know how to shoot the gastro try restaurants with the restaurant

141
00:25:25,34 --> 00:25:36,25
and say how do you know it's not the restaurant is going to be quite so good but natural didn't change it.

142
00:25:36,29 --> 00:25:45,75
She sighed because I assumed it was. If you will like the regime. Life is good because people are going to get a lot.

143
00:25:45,82 --> 00:25:57,36
She says there's a visiting a lot of people here that shows up with so that's probably going to just lose a shoe size

144
00:25:57,36 --> 00:25:59,68
was coming out.

145
00:26:01,06 --> 00:26:15,67
It was kind and it with me she said that it took a good French restaurant

146
00:26:18,63 --> 00:26:27,7
but I mean you know French really did she really for all of that said religion gravity is true

147
00:26:27,89 --> 00:26:35,73
and she had a very strong personality and that even though I think Christ.

148
00:26:36,73 --> 00:26:45,04
Yes we get like he was selling the last series she shares in the hours of your French restaurant

149
00:26:45,68 --> 00:27:11,91
and the price was a lot of very well she got very long. Yeah yeah but he was really in there once.

150
00:27:11,91 --> 00:27:28,3
Yes with the gentleman that I was with and if it was so you get there and live up to the rent that the rent.

151
00:27:28,31 --> 00:27:49,31
Here is are probably very sharp to the regulars of course the real world just recently which was a street market street

152
00:27:49,31 --> 00:27:59,67
out to keep the street three hundred was probably the most. So far as it was measured.

153
00:28:01,57 --> 00:28:22,56
The regular proper satellite system we saw that night dances they used to be for you know rooms which was the sort of

154
00:28:22,59 --> 00:28:28,87
well looking back pretty boy. Yeah it was just like a rise here by years old.

155
00:28:28,91 --> 00:28:31,64
Really it was like a very serious just off the wall.

156
00:28:31,67 --> 00:28:36,01
Here you know about you know like Shallow Hal sounds very softly

157
00:28:36,9 --> 00:28:41,38
and nothing exotic nothing it was really very right at the restaurant.

158
00:28:42,65 --> 00:28:58,21
We record here there were very little you know a lot of it was a little bit. I mean what was my son.

159
00:28:59,53 --> 00:29:06,42
Yes right there was mayday call as such or I'm sorry I mean it was just like a little restaurant.

160
00:29:06,63 --> 00:29:17,62
It was a time that matter. Was it you or it was better because it was just tables and chairs very orderly.

161
00:29:17,9 --> 00:29:23,76
But most places were in those days but it was in there as I was in the basement of the G. and G.

162
00:29:24,36 --> 00:29:31,79
So didn't draw walls on the ceiling were probably good because again if they are using they are safely buried which we

163
00:29:31,79 --> 00:29:40,54
are you know you really are in a car and our car people are looking out here and I rather fancy the tables

164
00:29:40,54 --> 00:29:51,62
and chairs the tables are right there with the bright light which was a bit because the headlights didn't reasonably

165
00:29:51,62 --> 00:30:00,9
high sitting up very light because it was based not only cantilever slightly probably are.

166
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:07,58
There's nothing structurally it was all right good here I read the painting the paint you know the interior painting

167
00:30:08,67 --> 00:30:21,78
dominated by the piano player one corner where you will eventually see the Man Who are you sure she said I felt like

168
00:30:21,88 --> 00:30:25,28
something big like we all are

169
00:30:25,28 --> 00:30:33,03
and really only an opera singers a lot of there's a piano to the shop I always raise a baby right here.

170
00:30:35,09 --> 00:30:41,84
So you know you noticed here is not unusual at all for a piano to be a quarter of the room so you're not there yet you

171
00:30:41,84 --> 00:30:47,65
with your heart. That's just your heart or develop nuclear you never did mention love to you.

172
00:30:49,78 --> 00:30:59,78
I didn't think it was a resident Rosalynn nor your Sarah and all the writers and people like that she was really here.

173
00:31:01,87 --> 00:31:07,19
She was there so it was more just it was more than just hear hear us.

174
00:31:07,38 --> 00:31:13,25
We're going to hear a lot more is expected in the it was like there were two of it here.

175
00:31:13,33 --> 00:31:23,46
I did a recent series of little old black and white and theatrical books for you.

176
00:31:23,54 --> 00:31:36,74
Yeah it was all the more the right drugs with Israel rushes to be used to draw you out because there's a theory around

177
00:31:36,74 --> 00:31:50,94
right now you want to hold it like don't do use husband had started the story he had with generic usually not with you

178
00:31:50,94 --> 00:32:00,15
if you know your problems lie then you write this love all.

179
00:32:01,06 --> 00:32:07,21
Just the meals very great for everybody so just me

180
00:32:10,38 --> 00:32:23,99
and you get nothing for about you get coffee with US style because of the DOT say it was more of all right.

181
00:32:23,99 --> 00:32:36,56
It was a very serious issue was the result was we all here really really really had the right.

182
00:32:36,57 --> 00:32:41,3
I mean the kind with the crash of Air.

183
00:32:41,36 --> 00:32:49,17
I was trying to find out about you and you just very sure what you want to do and I love her with you know your

184
00:32:49,17 --> 00:32:57,27
and your letter gram Good gracious and there's some high value and she was apparently way

185
00:32:57,27 --> 00:33:13,23
or did you just say Oh a lot of really good dancers. There used to work on the Wilson's point station.

186
00:33:13,32 --> 00:33:26,75
This would be just sort of through you know run by a man called the rich for fools rich family you know this is the

187
00:33:26,75 --> 00:33:36,51
really nobody can gauge where this should man up and you know

188
00:33:36,51 --> 00:33:45,82
and really hungry Lester you want to marry I want is the way to live.

189
00:33:46,03 --> 00:33:50,36
I guess that's just something you read through this really was younger

190
00:33:50,36 --> 00:34:00,01
but they were you know there is no life from here it is just on the north shore station and you.

191
00:34:03,1 --> 00:34:10,85
Well you didn't like sharks of mission challenging mission before their mission.

192
00:34:14,17 --> 00:34:20,21
Well I think growing drug drug here with growth would all be better off.

193
00:34:20,25 --> 00:34:29,72
Let the last apartment to somebody and that somebody must love source the people.

194
00:34:29,94 --> 00:34:39,61
It's you that's that big computer person three years ago I run sure you used to go out stairs to hear of the accident.

195
00:34:41,21 --> 00:34:52,09
Oh yeah pastoralist Well it was really quite a little over an hour ago long room with a very familiar lover's maze

196
00:34:52,31 --> 00:34:56,91
dance regularly just pretty good because you could go you can dance.

197
00:34:57,1 --> 00:35:08,85
You know man off the wall or you really do and I love you.

198
00:35:08,89 --> 00:35:13,56
Yes the floor go through the always play at dances

199
00:35:13,56 --> 00:35:26,34
and you wear jewelry three days around the piano grounds a couple of ice shelves full of years and years

200
00:35:26,34 --> 00:35:35,93
and well you know the Sundance thing here yesterday right here the most likely they used to be there's every day's have

201
00:35:35,93 --> 00:35:44,52
three street done that was done desk quite popular quite a number of the little coffee drinkers old out of a really

202
00:35:44,52 --> 00:35:50,23
strong nice cheap groceries for their head around as they are normally you would really like that.

203
00:35:50,24 --> 00:35:52,81
If you are right right there.

204
00:35:52,82 --> 00:36:00,16
It's all hands on through to the plant world yours there and here you dance with that for ya.

205
00:36:00,95 --> 00:36:10,76
Life is because your life you dance for my dear girl that you wish she she would do it is that she is ready that's

206
00:36:10,76 --> 00:36:22,96
really really the way fascinating because I know this year I know my risk to go dance or get off with a big win

207
00:36:24,47 --> 00:36:33,67
and that was the drag bit of track there I remember very few on the road. I learned there's a very old man.

208
00:36:33,99 --> 00:36:40,33
There he vested in me here with the black hair because

209
00:36:41,5 --> 00:36:49,73
and I remember he sang resolutely to the set with the folds of my hand very heavy bag

210
00:36:50,82 --> 00:36:59,91
or shawl over this whole Gulf of Pinched of the West Coasters of the oval black sort of dress

211
00:37:00,28 --> 00:37:15,38
and had his that's true yeah true that was all yeah yeah piano player. Get up and go on.

212
00:37:15,42 --> 00:37:22,71
Oh that really is your life

213
00:37:23,4 --> 00:37:33,92
and this is the course to figure out we're right around allowed to dance for all remember this is utterly without

214
00:37:33,92 --> 00:37:45,37
saying one of those maybe a bit lighter of course was over the period with the sun would she say to him for do you

215
00:37:45,37 --> 00:38:03,91
think you can do as you well know well. Oh fuck. Somebody quite clearly but don't you love it.

216
00:38:03,91 --> 00:38:09,67
Rub it in the hole about the fish in the middle of this he said well I was having issues.

217
00:38:10,03 --> 00:38:26,52
I'm sure it's very good for their grief. Oh it was thirty dollars.

218
00:38:26,7 --> 00:38:35,00
Oh I have your prayers pretty good because they said he sell it without really having a good feeling.

219
00:38:35,13 --> 00:38:45,6
There's nothing was ever going up or fluff. But he said very clearly there was something to shift in my life.

220
00:38:45,65 --> 00:39:00,32
Oh yeah probably. You can hardly hear it but it was surprising really he was going to have more people got to know me.

221
00:39:00,62 --> 00:39:13,82
Yes he just got a particular Friday night it was for the house he was telling you the address to give you any right to

222
00:39:13,82 --> 00:39:23,47
say has dissolved in the not the least you know yet. One of those anyway. You must run down really really.

223
00:39:23,54 --> 00:39:34,62
And of course you can go like hell yes God I try to go over something really quickly to people on the course of this it

224
00:39:34,62 --> 00:39:39,11
was so strong I just read a strong western suburbs and that's right.

225
00:39:39,21 --> 00:39:50,33
Less of those little resort suburbs or just being across history rather like places where people are there

226
00:39:50,33 --> 00:40:00,56
and oh yes to go around and very all over your flat tire.

227
00:40:01,06 --> 00:40:13,04
The place where you just like you just want to hear because I'm really upset because your station three he was a very

228
00:40:13,04 --> 00:40:24,52
well always straight to do very well yes I get the recurring answer yourself once I hear the Rex or the car.

229
00:40:25,25 --> 00:40:29,91
Yes I hear. Yeah we genuinely thought you had a child.

230
00:40:29,91 --> 00:40:40,16
Well you know it was then our station yesterday across used to every Sunday night.

231
00:40:40,2 --> 00:40:44,34
Mind you this was getting really really really good role.

232
00:40:44,35 --> 00:40:49,63
This is the night he used to regularly every Sunday

233
00:40:49,63 --> 00:41:04,08
and I still live at his flat in a place just off the flat was in the Victoria Street I'll say Fredricka the regulars

234
00:41:04,08 --> 00:41:15,31

235
00:41:15,33 --> 00:41:17,49

237
00:41:26,18 --> 00:41:30,86
Oh yeah well you do what you like but usually it's right there.

238
00:41:31,01 --> 00:41:39,14
Yeah I think you'd agree especially if you get this yes he got you.

239
00:41:39,15 --> 00:41:49,2
But if you like trying not as I know you have to get their agenda read you can't people like me here.

240
00:41:49,22 --> 00:42:00,35
SILAS You get your reasons you get a good draw where you get to see what sells funny in those days was only worth.

241
00:42:01,51 --> 00:42:10,58
You know it was very early in the wall all over the period over the every day and you get a yes

242
00:42:10,58 --> 00:42:13,14
or is America's America not yet you the Americans

243
00:42:13,89 --> 00:42:23,5
and yet now our this is exactly where you have to give a little you know with all the sixty's OK let's hear like he was

00:42:55,27 --> 00:43:05,48
She says cameras are out to get them that he didn't really notice this reply goes right that I have it is basically

249
00:43:05,48 --> 00:43:11,65
where it was said by some that are just she says cancer out to get Iraq

250
00:43:11,65 --> 00:43:19,11
and yet their prayers are being investigated further they say can't just park your car hit them.

257
00:44:04,36 --> 00:44:09,72
Was not the expression to be he actually tried to get the actual idea to be his brain

258
00:44:10,51 --> 00:44:22,52
and so your people would last for that matter that's why his four sons have people walking on T.V.

259
00:44:22,52 --> 00:44:31,66
and You know this is how we get a picture or a square mile square or a stand up that is that the worst thing

261
00:44:41,71 --> 00:44:43,88
she'd send you out she was dangerous.

262
00:44:45,81 --> 00:44:55,38
This was a real right he's right on the right here before there was another big co-inventor Oh yes

263
00:44:55,38 --> 00:45:06,6

00:45:41,33 --> 00:45:49,58
and it wasn't his fault that someone goes I would rather stay here a lot to help you a little more running along with

270
00:45:49,58 --> 00:45:50,43

277
00:46:37,46 --> 00:46:39,45
and you'll actually get a little bit far away

278
00:46:39,45 --> 00:46:49,48

301
00:50:55,08 --> 00:51:03,46
and intercourse was about drag their camp with.

302
00:51:04,92 --> 00:51:14,59
Yes just war at the start of the show you're in there years and that's another person.

303
00:51:16,19 --> 00:51:25,75
Johnny Hunter who has who is from here is a big star over here looking very pretty good beautiful looking

304
00:51:26,61 --> 00:51:33,31
and very good actress actor but I feel like he's still raw.

305
00:51:33,49 --> 00:51:39,56
He's working for the house

306
00:51:39,56 --> 00:51:48,58
or Johnny hundreds somebody really comes out because I think he's above the law in the last little bit.

307
00:51:48,62 --> 00:51:59,48
He was a little one and we all the girls would come back and he was not there a little love like for about three.

308
00:52:01,08 --> 00:52:24,12
Through years old. President Bush. Well we had to get the business this week and he you feel you know you hear clues.

309
00:52:24,32 --> 00:52:28,92
Well you're right you're matching I mean yes but I was serving.

310
00:52:29,08 --> 00:52:34,33
I was like he was character

311
00:52:34,33 --> 00:52:47,86
but I think like a lot of people thought Bill was more was more the sort of pantomime diary type of big business really

312
00:52:47,86 --> 00:52:50,96
was you know your morals.

313
00:52:51,11 --> 00:53:10,49
Show on Comedy of the Johnny Hunter was the real pretty glamorous he stands on point really about this rather life with

314
00:53:10,49 --> 00:53:21,37
very well that's real the house still living on the whole Well I was thinking Lord of all that he does not hold up

315
00:53:21,37 --> 00:53:28,2
rough John Christie he used to with Ross Jarrett years ago.

316
00:53:28,29 --> 00:53:42,01
It's nice to see it on a mission that he was because he was there with us.

317
00:53:42,03 --> 00:53:53,95
There will be in the ten years following the end of the war because that was their hearing myself I think that's a

318
00:53:53,95 --> 00:54:06,33
charge quite a big way because they voted to enjoy whatever it. They were good for the early years of this.

319
00:54:06,38 --> 00:54:14,17
It was just that they can become really really natural role models.

320
00:54:14,17 --> 00:54:35,08
If your life really good were the only success he would just give you just very rarely see you call

321
00:54:35,08 --> 00:54:39,15
or you would say living like you always this life is a life.

322
00:54:39,2 --> 00:54:43,86
They are very coarse or stuff they run is doing stuff here

323
00:54:43,86 --> 00:54:54,69
and there is a lot of writing poetry with that for all the girls all the right would have their rights for I say who

324
00:54:54,69 --> 00:55:14,15
else was in his life much. We were told he would never feel just it was for the girl and also his court cases so sure.

325
00:55:14,34 --> 00:55:37,3
Barbara Starr Norris charges something like this year around here if you go for your love life

326
00:55:37,3 --> 00:55:47,48
and they're getting the right you know the worst serial that's what characters around that is a very good person.

327
00:55:47,55 --> 00:55:54,68
You know this is why I really like the man but he's doing it with me and still a very good actress.

328
00:55:54,84 --> 00:55:59,64
Let's get straight drunk you remember there's a character around here it just.

329
00:56:03,33 --> 00:56:07,21
Like I just like a price to hear about it.

330
00:56:07,29 --> 00:56:22,72
Finally got me all these years just like players because that's really doc's here here and there's the Duchess.

331
00:56:22,78 --> 00:56:32,94
There's the Duchess the moment where I really pointed out to me I never met my terrible bass player just for the chair

332
00:56:32,97 --> 00:56:42,91
but he must've been a bit sorry. Right. There's a you that's right that's right. They are right.

333
00:56:42,99 --> 00:56:44,1
Little minor celebrity.

334
00:56:44,54 --> 00:56:52,91
Right right before you get a load you get out of all this you know there and do us a little bit younger. We'll be much.

335
00:56:52,96 --> 00:57:08,93
Oh yeah it's a little afraid. All right Larry said it's only like four years and then you sort of like a wish.

336
00:57:08,96 --> 00:57:11,54
Because if it was all set up with Black Monday.

337
00:57:11,63 --> 00:57:16,96
I think are there because I said it was like she knew this already

338
00:57:16,96 --> 00:57:27,28
but it's in those days it was much better various it was a good thing that you didn't like the same people all the

339
00:57:27,28 --> 00:57:40,08
weird how they should actually live the whole run that won't drag shows like they do the right thing.

340
00:57:40,1 --> 00:57:47,65
The jewel box for the first time again very well if you look through the general public whether California where

341
00:57:47,65 --> 00:57:50,6
or what you wish you good night. Rubbish. They're right.

342
00:57:50,61 --> 00:57:58,19
Yes that's really the out there don't you want your boss is one of those places where you wait to see a drag.

343
00:57:58,26 --> 00:58:00,62
Oh well it's a great great hall Nance really.

344
00:58:00,95 --> 00:58:07,28
Under drag things like strip a lesser You know full that you'd have dragged before.

345
00:58:08,08 --> 00:58:15,23
You had people living here is you have this fantastic hole in the sea wall that resort to either this

346
00:58:15,23 --> 00:58:21,09
or a little liaison with more circus type was.

347
00:58:21,14 --> 00:58:28,69
They really went through the circus with Russ just sort of just before the song you're left with all the duplicity

348
00:58:29,48 --> 00:58:39,62
and he was a solo act and everywhere very little kind why don't you just read the news reviews

349
00:58:40,5 --> 00:58:44,99
and with no great profits or jockstraps up for your fellows. That's all right.

350
00:58:45,34 --> 00:58:47,32
But up until they're done before

351
00:58:48,92 --> 00:58:56,53
but it was a single moment so young to old guys like you all you didn't get dragged mess.

352
00:58:56,84 --> 00:59:06,43
It's a big golden era of this sort of transvestite types that have bristled at the resort you put in here.

353
00:59:07,64 --> 00:59:16,95
I did it with three or four story just to look at here very British humor with a new little jokes life.

354
00:59:17,34 --> 00:59:23,24
Well you know very little rock star. Drug like nobody would be in the middle fifty's.

355
00:59:24,42 --> 00:59:36,06
Well I think the like very like what you would do well on life. Oh my God love you. Those kind of.

356
00:59:36,22 --> 00:59:46,06
Oh yes a lot of us yelling was the river. I thought the eggs at the cinema this hospital done right it was hard.

357
00:59:46,12 --> 00:59:49,28
Yet with the similar price

358
00:59:49,28 --> 01:00:00,28
and I thought you got it through the cinema hall Helstar room door a big room with people like that really cold.

359
01:00:02,79 --> 01:00:07,21
First piracy drag this out so I think I remember

360
01:00:07,21 --> 01:00:19,96
when I was really really well we are living across that here that they are signs that said Of course you know where the

361
01:00:19,96 --> 01:00:23,06
truck was you know you guys about two

362
01:00:23,06 --> 01:00:47,82
or three years old this year so I suppose my life was fine unless you're absolutely right.

363
01:00:50,08 --> 01:01:05,66
That's because the old world. There was also is there a horse. I hope you like but there is a book about young people.

364
01:01:07,6 --> 01:01:19,94
They say family you say you knew this car or steal or Michael Vick. They're all good for nothing.

365
01:01:19,95 --> 01:01:26,76
A lot of really they really don't like the jargon that a lot yet raising here here.

366
01:01:26,88 --> 01:01:30,15
Plus appears to be a lot easier

367
01:01:30,15 --> 01:01:42,99
or whatever it was right there something that people here at the wall of silence just actually were just refused to be

368
01:01:42,99 --> 01:02:03,84
OK love you love me love because you know what this is saying get him out there. Right. Famous case it was some man.

369
01:02:03,86 --> 01:02:04,34
It was right.

370
01:02:04,35 --> 01:02:17,82
Well you know I mean it was something like all three of him carrying something they do in that case with a young chap

371
01:02:17,82 --> 01:02:26,82
and you can hear that again that was about you. Yes yes yes oh yes the first draft was.

372
01:02:27,18 --> 01:02:32,24
Yes a little that was given tremendous coverage and with that.
