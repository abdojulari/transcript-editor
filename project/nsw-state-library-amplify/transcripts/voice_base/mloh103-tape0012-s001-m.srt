1
00:00:15,83 --> 00:00:17,41
That's why the.

2
00:00:18,69 --> 00:00:23,82
I don't know those two minutes

3
00:00:24,70 --> 00:00:29,26
or so i don't need to. Limit.

4
00:00:29,67 --> 00:00:35,60
You know why does he turn.

5
00:00:35,62 --> 00:00:41,60
Like. Simon. Simon can.

6
00:00:41,61 --> 00:00:45,99
Serve unless.

7
00:00:46,00 --> 00:00:52,56
They tell me why i didn't
come to the aquarius

8
00:00:52,56 --> 00:00:54,59
festival. I was working.

9
00:00:55,15 --> 00:01:00,61
My name's limit and i've lived
here since permanently in 79.

10
00:01:00,63 --> 00:01:04,44
And i heard about the squarest test for.

11
00:01:05,85 --> 00:01:08,71
I guess there must have been a lot of
advertising or something like that.

12
00:01:10,41 --> 00:01:11,95
Certainly people were talking about it

13
00:01:11,95 --> 00:01:17,50
and i was working in this funky
vegetarian restaurant and.

14
00:01:17,52 --> 00:01:18,93
We closed down so

15
00:01:18,93 --> 00:01:21,96
that people would have the opportunity
to come up for the festival

16
00:01:21,96 --> 00:01:25,10
and i made mine turned
up with some pink rocks.

17
00:01:25,76 --> 00:01:28,56
And that was that there was no choice.

18
00:01:28,58 --> 00:01:31,96
I had been going to hitchhike
up the coast from sydney and.

19
00:01:31,97 --> 00:01:36,28
Camp and so on and i had a
lot of mates from school

20
00:01:36,28 --> 00:01:40,47
and so on who were who were coming
because i'd left school for i think and.

21
00:01:41,75 --> 00:01:44,33
I think it up using drugs.

22
00:01:44,35 --> 00:01:51,17
Copious amounts there are for the the
time that the restaurant was closed and.

23
00:01:51,19 --> 00:01:54,52
Then the restaurant reopened
and i got the sack something

24
00:01:54,52 --> 00:01:58,61
and i think it was the first the first
job that i'd ever had and first.

25
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,90
First consequences of my addiction

26
00:02:01,90 --> 00:02:05,01
but everybody else seemed to have a
really good time at the festival

27
00:02:05,01 --> 00:02:09,21
and i ended up coming
up a few years later.

28
00:02:09,23 --> 00:02:14,94
I think i've done my kid must've been
about eight months old i came up in the

29
00:02:14,94 --> 00:02:16,66
travelling north and.

30
00:02:17,54 --> 00:02:18,58
And we started tumble

31
00:02:19,87 --> 00:02:24,22
and i remember trying to buy milk in the
morning because we'd run out of milk

32
00:02:25,07 --> 00:02:26,06
and i had none. Myself

33
00:02:26,06 --> 00:02:31,92
and i couldn't get anybody to say i'm
not the woman who was in charge of the

34
00:02:31,92 --> 00:02:35,76
fucking cow wouldn't sell me because
it was about a clock in the morning

35
00:02:35,76 --> 00:02:40,33
and she had other shit to do. And i
got so angry i was really pissed off

36
00:02:41,62 --> 00:02:44,89
and i thought this is a really vile place.

37
00:02:46,02 --> 00:02:49,25
And then come back for about four
years and then i moved back up here

38
00:02:49,25 --> 00:02:50,28
and up here

39
00:02:51,41 --> 00:02:57,65
but yet my sort of early experiences in
the world sort of negative in one way

40
00:02:57,65 --> 00:03:03,54
or another even not coming here or
getting pissed off for the lack of.

41
00:03:06,40 --> 00:03:12,26
Monash study. I'm sorry. Simon
cass. I mean the memory.

42
00:03:14,33 --> 00:03:20,68
I came up i was i came up to the festival
in the original aquarius festival i was a

43
00:03:20,68 --> 00:03:25,37
student at monash university
at the time studying economics

44
00:03:25,37 --> 00:03:29,24
and politics.

45
00:03:29,26 --> 00:03:33,02
And i was really studying revolution there
that's the main reason i'm going to

46
00:03:33,02 --> 00:03:38,74
monash a lot lang was there was the
heyday of the entity of the anti-vietnam

47
00:03:38,74 --> 00:03:44,13
and anti conscription
movement and the focus of

48
00:03:44,13 --> 00:03:48,04
that fight seem to be coming
from monash so i went to monash

49
00:03:48,04 --> 00:03:54,52
and i hung in there for a couple of
years and when that came to an end.

50
00:03:57,41 --> 00:04:00,05
That came to an end was
that university choir. Yes.

51
00:04:00,06 --> 00:04:03,58
First of all came up i went and i figured.

52
00:04:03,61 --> 00:04:06,08
Basically i figured this
was the next direction

53
00:04:06,08 --> 00:04:12,04
that the revolutionary was
was headed into the hills.

54
00:04:12,85 --> 00:04:18,84
My career was a bit dicey my drug consumption
was sort of escalating and i thought.

55
00:04:20,27 --> 00:04:25,19
You know the place for me is the
place for health for revolution.

56
00:04:25,21 --> 00:04:30,25
And for the good life and i came up.

57
00:04:30,27 --> 00:04:35,47
Went to the festival.
Went back to melbourne.

58
00:04:35,49 --> 00:04:40,48
Took awhile to organize all
the staff and car girlfriend

59
00:04:41,38 --> 00:04:44,28
and head up for this area
head up to this area and.

60
00:04:46,17 --> 00:04:48,27
Moved in and basically i've
been based in this area.

61
00:04:48,50 --> 00:04:52,66
Ever since couple of years
later i bought a share

62
00:04:52,66 --> 00:04:55,92
and a ton of all lived there for a while

63
00:04:56,65 --> 00:05:03,05
and i moved around lived in this been
based in this area. Ever since then.

64
00:05:03,07 --> 00:05:13,97
To support.

65
00:05:13,99 --> 00:05:20,32
I think jennifer i mean i think if
you're an addict you manifest drugs

66
00:05:20,32 --> 00:05:26,83
like i mean they're you fuel and you
have to do it and that's just reality.

67
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:31,91
And so i mean i just did anything
that i needed to do to get drugs

68
00:05:31,91 --> 00:05:37,43
and i mean in the early days it wasn't a
diet in assessing i didn't have to have

69
00:05:37,43 --> 00:05:39,05
drugs on a daily basis.

70
00:05:39,13 --> 00:05:44,76
I could just you know and occasionally and
so and i just i feel like we can use.

71
00:05:45,28 --> 00:05:51,03
You know be nj. Yes. More like been
issues here and in latter days.

72
00:05:52,09 --> 00:05:55,87
Fortunately street culture and
grown up enough so that one could.

73
00:05:55,89 --> 00:06:00,81
Harass tourists on a daily basis and
and make a quick. No. So it wasn't.

74
00:06:00,83 --> 00:06:06,41
I mean once that it happened it was
that it was a really easy thing to.

75
00:06:06,42 --> 00:06:09,04
To survive in terms of your
addiction but prior to

76
00:06:09,04 --> 00:06:14,10
that everybody just really just is
more erratic leader or you go off

77
00:06:14,10 --> 00:06:19,42
and you get money in the city
and the city or whatever.

78
00:06:19,44 --> 00:06:25,80
Yeah i want to know one of the reasons i
came up here was to get away from from.

79
00:06:25,82 --> 00:06:29,18
Narcotics or so it's hard drugs.

80
00:06:30,42 --> 00:06:34,62
And quite a few of my friends and up
in the hills the same reason. Whereas.

81
00:06:34,63 --> 00:06:41,12
Our ideology equated.
Psychedelics as cool and.

82
00:06:42,40 --> 00:06:44,19
As cool and acceptable

83
00:06:44,19 --> 00:06:48,94
and part of part of the fight against the
established while we did pretty early in

84
00:06:48,94 --> 00:06:54,90
the piece perceived narcotics
and alcohol and barbiturates

85
00:06:54,90 --> 00:07:01,77
and pills as pretty much uncool
uncool as methods for the

86
00:07:01,77 --> 00:07:07,47
establishment to control people. And
in those days we were pretty we want.

87
00:07:07,47 --> 00:07:10,83
I mean we were we knew about the c.i.a.

88
00:07:10,83 --> 00:07:15,50
Smuggling heroin out of there and we knew
all that we knew all the connections

89
00:07:15,50 --> 00:07:20,25
and it was pretty taboo and. Well.

90
00:07:20,68 --> 00:07:25,57
Where as we enjoyed the psychedelics we
we didn't really feel comfortable with.

91
00:07:27,08 --> 00:07:29,73
Using and using their
colleagues and we did

92
00:07:30,74 --> 00:07:33,28
that once again there was a
definite contradiction there.

93
00:07:33,31 --> 00:07:36,63
What that there wasn't
with the psychedelics and.

94
00:07:37,92 --> 00:07:40,73
Yeah that was one of the reasons i
moved up here was to get away from

95
00:07:40,73 --> 00:07:45,63
that whole scene. I actually my
perceptions of melbourne at that time

96
00:07:45,63 --> 00:07:48,15
or actually had i mean it was harder

97
00:07:48,15 --> 00:07:50,87
and harder to get the mind
expanding drugs in melbourne

98
00:07:50,87 --> 00:07:55,90
and more of the hard drugs of coming
in and and we looked upon that as.

99
00:07:55,92 --> 00:08:02,71
You know as. A means of.
Pression a means of.

100
00:08:02,72 --> 00:08:08,43
That weakening the sort of revolutionary
movement we felt was was happening at

101
00:08:08,43 --> 00:08:12,55
that time and i think. I think
it's probably a big part of it.

102
00:08:12,60 --> 00:08:15,87
I think i think you know narcotics
in places like the spike.

103
00:08:15,95 --> 00:08:21,17
I think history proved that you know
those drugs have have affected.

104
00:08:21,74 --> 00:08:28,04
Those elements of the society which are
most likely to be trying to change society

105
00:08:28,04 --> 00:08:38,01
but yes a lot of people can't here
to get away from some hard drugs.

106
00:08:38,87 --> 00:08:44,08
Up here.

107
00:08:45,22 --> 00:08:47,10
A lot of it was.

108
00:08:48,54 --> 00:08:54,56
For me personally is political
to be done well for me it was

109
00:08:55,60 --> 00:09:01,37
basically trying to build to become
separate to become separate economically

110
00:09:01,37 --> 00:09:07,81
politically socially to be independent to
not be dependent on mainstream society

111
00:09:09,07 --> 00:09:09,19
for.

112
00:09:10,57 --> 00:09:16,54
From everything from our basic material
necessities to our to our cultural to our

113
00:09:16,54 --> 00:09:22,60
cultural consumption was to
build an alternative system.

114
00:09:23,76 --> 00:09:29,33
I think we i didn't really i didn't perceive
i didn't perceive any real likelihood

115
00:09:29,33 --> 00:09:32,81
of any violent revolution ever happening
in australia but i really thought

116
00:09:32,81 --> 00:09:39,29
that we could perhaps build
an alternative society which.

117
00:09:40,99 --> 00:09:46,35
Had a lot of those values that that that
i that i for mainstream society lacked

118
00:09:46,35 --> 00:09:52,51
and so basically what we were about was
trying to build. A different system.

119
00:09:52,86 --> 00:09:58,37
You know different schools different
economy. You know not plugged into the grid.

120
00:09:58,58 --> 00:10:02,73
I mean not even. Same food.
I mean self-sufficient.

121
00:10:02,98 --> 00:10:12,31
And independent from it.

122
00:10:13,05 --> 00:10:18,44
Once again i think. Yeah.

123
00:10:18,46 --> 00:10:22,47
I. I think i think grass.

124
00:10:23,79 --> 00:10:28,91
Grass in particular was it was a great help
for a lot of people not all people for

125
00:10:28,91 --> 00:10:33,78
a lot of people to get started up here.
I mean people didn't have any money.

126
00:10:34,20 --> 00:10:37,53
There was no work.

127
00:10:38,29 --> 00:10:40,78
There was no way to get a regular
income people to go away

128
00:10:40,78 --> 00:10:47,19
and get a bit of a grubstake to
get started. That. After that.

129
00:10:47,20 --> 00:10:51,71
That the only thing they could do to
supplement their income was social security

130
00:10:51,71 --> 00:10:56,22
or seasonal work and. And
the extra few dollars that.

131
00:10:56,67 --> 00:11:00,62
That a bit of grass brought in to the
families was enough to get the car the car

132
00:11:00,62 --> 00:11:06,70
registered or the engine the engine
reboard or the tin for the roof

133
00:11:07,43 --> 00:11:10,80
and i think for quite a few
people was a pretty integral part

134
00:11:11,76 --> 00:11:16,90
and it sat at set ideologically it's a
pretty well with people because it was part

135
00:11:16,90 --> 00:11:23,51
once again of building an
economy outside the mainstream.

136
00:11:23,53 --> 00:11:23,79
And

137
00:11:25,94 --> 00:11:37,31
that is.

138
00:11:39,43 --> 00:11:41,38
You know i don't believe
that i don't believe

139
00:11:41,38 --> 00:11:47,92
that you know vested interest became
involved or that you know any people.

140
00:11:47,93 --> 00:11:51,53
Grew large quantities of doubts i mean i
don't think there was ever anything like

141
00:11:51,53 --> 00:11:53,00
the grass castle syndrome

142
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:58,52
that say happening with us because i think
the ideology of the people engaged in

143
00:11:58,52 --> 00:12:03,19
the action. Permeated the results in

144
00:12:03,20 --> 00:12:08,17
that you know nobody wanted
fucking huge castle of anyway.

145
00:12:08,32 --> 00:12:13,58
You know you wanted just some nice little
house in the forest you wanted good

146
00:12:13,58 --> 00:12:19,20
gardens. Nobody wanted mercs nobody
wanted to have you know high tech videos

147
00:12:19,20 --> 00:12:19,77
or anything like

148
00:12:19,77 --> 00:12:26,26
that everybody had a notion of you know
leading a pretty sort of soundly principled

149
00:12:26,26 --> 00:12:32,26
life based on on you know low
iq low economics and so on.

150
00:12:32,28 --> 00:12:37,11
I mean if somebody did manage to pollute
to grow like you know a few pounds of

151
00:12:37,11 --> 00:12:39,68
diodes. I mean nobody
knew what to do with it.

152
00:12:39,84 --> 00:12:44,41
Probably a half of it away as their main
door they i mean everybody smoked a lot of

153
00:12:44,41 --> 00:12:46,95
dope too so people were
sort of or had a party.

154
00:12:47,42 --> 00:12:49,11
You know i think like i mean it was at

155
00:12:49,11 --> 00:12:52,05
that thing of exchange too
like i don't know anybody

156
00:12:52,05 --> 00:12:58,70
that i can think of around here
who who you know got heavy

157
00:12:58,70 --> 00:13:00,97
or grew a lot of diaper or anything like

158
00:13:00,97 --> 00:13:04,58
that like people might have just
built really nice houses but even

159
00:13:04,58 --> 00:13:07,68
that you know like they did
a lot of that themselves

160
00:13:07,68 --> 00:13:13,07
and they might have employed a mate to
do some so for whatever i don't you know

161
00:13:13,07 --> 00:13:18,28
nobody ever sat around up here
in their patches with rifles or.

162
00:13:18,29 --> 00:13:21,88
You know rabbit traps or anything like
that it was and i mean i think that

163
00:13:21,88 --> 00:13:23,14
that sort of language has been.

164
00:13:23,46 --> 00:13:26,63
All that sort of discourse has been
engaged in that i don't believe

165
00:13:26,63 --> 00:13:30,09
but i just think that that
people would like to imagine

166
00:13:30,10 --> 00:13:32,08
that sort of thing
happening up in the hills

167
00:13:32,08 --> 00:13:33,30
but it's certainly not been my experience

168
00:13:33,30 --> 00:13:37,96
and i've known you know a lot of
people growing dope for a lot of years

169
00:13:37,96 --> 00:13:41,86
and it just seemed the people who were
talked about as you know inverted commas big

170
00:13:41,86 --> 00:13:47,97
doug rose are just people living in shacks
who maybe sit on a pound of dope for a

171
00:13:47,97 --> 00:13:52,86
year and that's their smoko for the whole
year they tournaments on and so on.

172
00:13:53,07 --> 00:13:56,32
I never perceived it as
a big growth industry.

173
00:13:57,12 --> 00:13:59,83
Other than you know a
sustainable kind of trip.

174
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,51
Four people to just live on simply
you know the sylvania waters type of

175
00:14:06,85 --> 00:14:11,58
millionaire process
that's for sure. I mean.

176
00:14:12,16 --> 00:14:17,01
Just the whole nature of the land up here
and the amount of people means that.

177
00:14:17,59 --> 00:14:23,40
Basically people can't get away with large
with large plantar the nature of the

178
00:14:23,40 --> 00:14:28,02
land and the amount of people around
here and people can't get away.

179
00:14:28,14 --> 00:14:33,21
You know i mean people don't grow large
crops i mean they they grow in south

180
00:14:33,21 --> 00:14:36,14
australia a couple of all the griffith.

181
00:14:36,36 --> 00:14:43,19
I mean that's i mean large quantities and
have been busted up here i mean you know.

182
00:14:44,08 --> 00:14:48,18
Dollar drug busts like somebody
got bought trays of seedling side

183
00:14:48,18 --> 00:14:50,20
and some seedlings like
two inches high and

184
00:14:50,20 --> 00:14:52,63
that i mean they've never ever
to be a full grown plant.

185
00:14:52,82 --> 00:14:55,13
There's never been the plantations

186
00:14:55,13 --> 00:14:59,29
that they've found in other areas where
there's never been the organisation i mean

187
00:14:59,29 --> 00:15:02,96
the people up here all bunch of
anarchists i mean really about

188
00:15:03,67 --> 00:15:07,33
that everything we ever managed to organise
with the defence of the forests move in

189
00:15:07,33 --> 00:15:10,99
that i mean was very ad hoc going
to really had a hawk and and

190
00:15:10,99 --> 00:15:13,41
that made it work to you
know like we were able to do

191
00:15:13,41 --> 00:15:17,91
that so well because everybody could
just you know run around in the forest

192
00:15:17,91 --> 00:15:18,60
and be crazy.

193
00:15:18,74 --> 00:15:23,70
Basically i mean there was never about
a very sort of crime to be not there.

194
00:15:23,70 --> 00:15:28,18
Made out the only sort of crime you ever
got up here was totally disorganized crime

195
00:15:28,18 --> 00:15:33,67
you know on a really small
on a really small scale.

196
00:15:33,70 --> 00:15:36,51
I mean even the kind of crime

197
00:15:36,52 --> 00:15:39,95
that occurs in towns like i don't
think there's ever been many here

198
00:15:39,96 --> 00:15:44,59
or there are people running around
stealing people's videos or anything like

199
00:15:44,59 --> 00:15:46,02
that and i mean you could probably argue

200
00:15:46,02 --> 00:15:51,08
that because of this is a bit of a dope
economy you know people can say in terms of

201
00:15:51,08 --> 00:15:53,47
addiction support their habits here

202
00:15:53,47 --> 00:15:57,77
and they don't need to sort of go
around with you know people's property

203
00:15:57,77 --> 00:16:04,28
or anything like that. Yes. So. So yes.

204
00:16:04,54 --> 00:16:09,75
By the driver further up.

205
00:16:09,77 --> 00:16:13,22
The good doesn't happen
the drug problem it's a.

206
00:16:13,24 --> 00:16:15,75
Well that's a drug problem
as i perceive it.

207
00:16:15,82 --> 00:16:16,50
They say think

208
00:16:16,50 --> 00:16:20,68
that the drug problem is you know a few
sort of really skinny looking ferals

209
00:16:20,68 --> 00:16:25,34
and that you know that. Writer.

210
00:16:25,36 --> 00:16:27,77
I think people see the drug problem.

211
00:16:28,47 --> 00:16:32,46
As very singular like it's just you know
if you skinny ferals hanging around

212
00:16:32,46 --> 00:16:33,75
outside the rainbow cafe

213
00:16:33,75 --> 00:16:37,83
and that's a really horrific drug problem
whereas in fact nobody's being burgled.

214
00:16:37,85 --> 00:16:39,96
You know nobody's videos are being taken.

215
00:16:41,65 --> 00:16:46,92
It's just that we have one street cullen
street with a couple of offshoots.

216
00:16:47,59 --> 00:16:52,20
And people sit on the street outside
the rainbow or outside the museum.

217
00:16:53,01 --> 00:16:56,24
Or outside the tomato sauce
and sometimes they're pissed

218
00:16:56,24 --> 00:17:00,91
and sometimes they're on the nod and
i'm not saying it's a pretty sight.

219
00:17:02,08 --> 00:17:06,95
But it's it's a very small time drug problem
it's it's not anything particularly

220
00:17:06,95 --> 00:17:10,11
serious and often you know i think
that the people aren't even on the nod

221
00:17:10,11 --> 00:17:12,13
or pissed they're just sitting
there looking minutes.

222
00:17:12,49 --> 00:17:15,82
And that would probably give the
kids a lot of pleasure to sort of be

223
00:17:15,82 --> 00:17:17,20
that menacing and

224
00:17:17,20 --> 00:17:20,64
and i know it must be really hard to be a
little old lady with a shopping trolley

225
00:17:20,64 --> 00:17:21,73
walking down the street.

226
00:17:22,79 --> 00:17:25,77
And having to walk through that little
bottleneck in front of the rainbow and.

227
00:17:27,10 --> 00:17:30,88
I've actually recently suggested
that we extend the streetscape so

228
00:17:30,88 --> 00:17:33,98
that there's several bottlenecks
there rather than just the one and

229
00:17:33,98 --> 00:17:36,43
that way people can move
at random through it but

230
00:17:36,43 --> 00:17:39,14
and it must be really scary
because they don't know

231
00:17:39,14 --> 00:17:43,41
that you know this kid's just an 18
year old and he's just a goof head

232
00:17:43,41 --> 00:17:47,51
or whatever you know they just see him
as a as a dirty threatening person and

233
00:17:47,51 --> 00:17:53,01
that must be really hard but i mean they're
not they're not. It's not kings cross.

234
00:17:53,62 --> 00:17:54,25
You know

235
00:17:54,25 --> 00:17:58,88
and i'm also i think the dope problem is
just this catch phrase used to describe.

236
00:18:00,87 --> 00:18:07,85
Runaway kids homelessness poverty psych
patients who have been kicked out

237
00:18:07,85 --> 00:18:10,06
of halfway housing we've
got nowhere to go.

238
00:18:11,68 --> 00:18:15,62
It's people we don't like it's the drug
problem is the drug problem are the other

239
00:18:15,62 --> 00:18:19,24
that is the drug marginalised and
who haven't got anywhere to go and

240
00:18:19,24 --> 00:18:21,33
that we don't want here in our nice town.

241
00:18:21,61 --> 00:18:26,60
You know we want town to be a
fairly sanitary type of place.

242
00:18:26,62 --> 00:18:29,01
And they wrecked so the
landscape architecture

243
00:18:29,01 --> 00:18:32,82
and people don't see it in terms
of economics of a poverty

244
00:18:32,82 --> 00:18:35,85
and homelessness they said in
terms of the drug problem.

245
00:18:35,92 --> 00:18:38,60
You know whereas a lot of those
people have got a drug problem

246
00:18:38,60 --> 00:18:41,71
and they just sitting there could
have got nowhere else to bloody sit

247
00:18:41,71 --> 00:18:42,50
and nowhere else to go

248
00:18:43,66 --> 00:18:46,88
and they've got i mean they may not have
much in their lives from our perspective

249
00:18:46,88 --> 00:18:48,38
that.

250
00:18:48,40 --> 00:18:50,62
You know like you don't have
to have much in your life

251
00:18:50,62 --> 00:18:53,08
when you're 18 you just want
to hang out and hang around

252
00:18:53,08 --> 00:18:58,07
and people people see all that and
rather than looking at the real issues.

253
00:18:58,10 --> 00:19:02,86
The fundamental issues because of
all the needier high because of.

254
00:19:02,88 --> 00:19:06,99
Because of you know the issues
of the vested interests.

255
00:19:07,49 --> 00:19:13,19
The vested interests a pushing in this
town all these these complex social issues

256
00:19:13,19 --> 00:19:17,01
that are occurring everywhere over the
whole western eastern world these days not

257
00:19:17,01 --> 00:19:19,98
just nim and just come under
that the tidy problem.

258
00:19:20,07 --> 00:19:24,11
The tide is heading of
the drug problem and.

259
00:19:25,05 --> 00:19:28,38
I mean i think that's the hardest thing
because people do use do seen in as

260
00:19:28,38 --> 00:19:30,65
separate as a different place and

261
00:19:30,66 --> 00:19:34,39
that we shouldn't have these sort of problems
here we should have some kind of idea

262
00:19:34,39 --> 00:19:40,51
leak kind of resolutely and model
of acting pastoral life you know

263
00:19:40,51 --> 00:19:41,91
and it's ridiculous.

264
00:19:41,92 --> 00:19:46,43
Like we have the same kind of
problems that that every you know.

265
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:49,31
Western capitalist nation has

266
00:19:49,31 --> 00:19:52,66
and i mean we're just we're just a
microcosm of the tiny problems.

267
00:19:53,04 --> 00:19:56,27
That other places have and i mean
why shouldn't it be any different.

268
00:19:56,68 --> 00:19:59,56
I mean that's something that really
irritates me. Actually what i.

269
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:01,92
Private p'tite is it.

270
00:20:01,97 --> 00:20:07,02
I think people have this notion that
nimbin is this fucking wonderful place and

271
00:20:07,02 --> 00:20:09,55
and should be this sort of dream.

272
00:20:10,69 --> 00:20:13,87
And that we're not we're just really
ordinary people and and the problems

273
00:20:13,87 --> 00:20:18,21
that we have a ordinary problems like
you know mundane things like alcoholism

274
00:20:18,21 --> 00:20:18,95
and drug addiction

275
00:20:18,95 --> 00:20:22,12
and i mean they happen everywhere
they happen in i don't know cholera

276
00:20:22,12 --> 00:20:24,45
and they happen in collins street and.

277
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:27,02
That's just the way it
is and i mean i think

278
00:20:27,02 --> 00:20:28,25
that there are really positive things

279
00:20:28,25 --> 00:20:31,77
that we can do about it you know
such as you know halfway houses

280
00:20:31,77 --> 00:20:37,17
and drug education i think it's really
important to have drug education for teenage

281
00:20:37,17 --> 00:20:40,31
kids and you know workshops for them and

282
00:20:40,31 --> 00:20:44,51
and i think it's important to have a lot
of other things for our teenage kids were

283
00:20:44,51 --> 00:20:50,04
a society here. That is is going to
have a baby you know like my kids 18.

284
00:20:50,18 --> 00:20:54,03
He's in the older age category. My
brothers girlfriends. Twenty two.

285
00:20:54,38 --> 00:20:57,96
She's one of the first set of
kids that went through and more

286
00:20:57,96 --> 00:21:02,46
and more like around the 14 year old age
group where my nephews are we have a lot

287
00:21:02,46 --> 00:21:04,67
of a lot of kids coming up and i think

288
00:21:04,67 --> 00:21:09,48
that we need to sort of provide facilities
for them not just you know in regard to

289
00:21:09,48 --> 00:21:12,98
sort of drug and alcohol
education or anything like that

290
00:21:12,98 --> 00:21:15,12
but i mean like we've
got the youth club and

291
00:21:15,12 --> 00:21:18,28
that needs funding i mean
kids in any country town.

292
00:21:18,53 --> 00:21:22,06
Need a lot of things to do and again you
know i mean this is no different in

293
00:21:22,06 --> 00:21:25,43
that and perhaps we can address
things in a more creative manner.

294
00:21:25,77 --> 00:21:28,08
Than other country townsman we
can give them better things

295
00:21:28,08 --> 00:21:29,60
and snooker tables you know but.

296
00:21:31,08 --> 00:21:32,77
It's certainly something we're
going to have to look at

297
00:21:33,66 --> 00:21:37,84
and i don't think you know that our
kids are going to be any different.

298
00:21:38,11 --> 00:21:41,90
Most of our kids are going to will leave
most of our kids want to going to going to

299
00:21:41,90 --> 00:21:44,47
want to you know live in the
cities and do the things

300
00:21:44,47 --> 00:21:50,52
that city kids do most
sickly sort of in this

301
00:21:52,03 --> 00:21:57,39
way. Well i think that
the nimbleness is is one

302
00:21:57,39 --> 00:21:59,88
that is carried in the
hearts of many australians.

303
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,05
It's of the post 70s generation i
mean the call went out. Didn't it.

304
00:22:05,14 --> 00:22:08,95
The call went out to. Those of us who'd.

305
00:22:09,30 --> 00:22:14,02
You know grown up in the
60s and and many answered

306
00:22:14,02 --> 00:22:18,17
that call you know people came
to him and i mean i think grown.

307
00:22:18,71 --> 00:22:23,41
And joined a pretty good job of public
publicity and i mean i missed out.

308
00:22:23,44 --> 00:22:29,41
Unfortunately but that was my own choice
probably. And i mean people came and.

309
00:22:29,43 --> 00:22:31,17
And i think people had
a fucking good party.

310
00:22:31,29 --> 00:22:34,57
They had a great party and that's
probably all it was i mean i think

311
00:22:34,57 --> 00:22:37,18
that there's this this self importance

312
00:22:37,18 --> 00:22:41,38
that takes place you know you know in
people's minds where they where they have to

313
00:22:41,38 --> 00:22:42,70
sort of.

314
00:22:42,72 --> 00:22:46,40
Build up their used to make it
meaningful or something like that and

315
00:22:47,66 --> 00:22:52,52
and particularly you know like those who
left those who just came for the party.

316
00:22:52,79 --> 00:22:54,90
They went away and they wanted to see

317
00:22:54,90 --> 00:22:58,83
that they took place in something
meaningful for once in their damn lives and

318
00:22:59,71 --> 00:23:01,28
and so you know this miss about nym

319
00:23:01,28 --> 00:23:05,62
and girl offers as you know the repository
of failed dreams or not you know

320
00:23:05,62 --> 00:23:09,25
and i mean i think it's really difficult
for those of us who actually live here

321
00:23:09,25 --> 00:23:12,84
because people expect us to sort
of behave in in a certain way.

322
00:23:13,12 --> 00:23:19,45
You know to be some kind of
you know visionary society

323
00:23:20,32 --> 00:23:23,13
to live out those ideals of the 70s

324
00:23:23,13 --> 00:23:26,87
and i mean basically it's the 90s i don't
i don't see why i should have to live out

325
00:23:26,87 --> 00:23:28,92
anybody's vision. Other than my own

326
00:23:28,92 --> 00:23:32,75
and you know my own vision is as you
know fairly small time and personal

327
00:23:32,75 --> 00:23:34,71
and i like living here
it's a great place to live

328
00:23:34,71 --> 00:23:40,26
but i certainly don't see it in any in any
noble terms and i don't see it in any.

329
00:23:40,28 --> 00:23:43,74
You know particularly idealistic
terms i mean i do think that.

330
00:23:44,10 --> 00:23:46,41
I do think that the
personal is political and

331
00:23:46,41 --> 00:23:49,15
that you know you live out
your politics in your life.

332
00:23:49,55 --> 00:23:52,81
And you can only do that in a
really really small way in effect.

333
00:23:54,19 --> 00:23:57,18
Those that are really close to you and.

334
00:23:57,20 --> 00:23:59,88
I don't know i mean i think
something really weird went on.

335
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:00,32
Nimbin

336
00:24:00,32 --> 00:24:07,12
and people who were
probably really good at at

337
00:24:07,13 --> 00:24:07,74
publicity

338
00:24:08,79 --> 00:24:12,25
and i mean we've all got sort of fairly
public skills you know people who sort of

339
00:24:12,25 --> 00:24:14,94
were trained in the sort of seventies and

340
00:24:16,52 --> 00:24:20,23
and i guess we've got the
numbers too i think that

341
00:24:21,29 --> 00:24:27,58
that people kind of did develop a myth
about what mean and was and and its place.

342
00:24:27,61 --> 00:24:30,88
I mean i think it it occupies
a lot a much larger need.

343
00:24:31,27 --> 00:24:36,13
Then it then it could you know
possibly ever kind of feel i think

344
00:24:36,13 --> 00:24:41,07
that it looms large in people's minds really
unnecessarily you know like it's just

345
00:24:41,07 --> 00:24:42,17
a place where people live.

346
00:24:42,25 --> 00:24:46,36
It's a country town and i mean most of
us a fairly well-educated who live here.

347
00:24:46,64 --> 00:24:51,40
I mean there was you know a real element
of of of people who were very bright

348
00:24:51,40 --> 00:24:53,41
and very middle class kind we live

349
00:24:53,41 --> 00:24:57,19
and so we've probably got in terms
of brain the top heavy town

350
00:24:57,19 --> 00:25:00,02
but you know that's that's about it.

351
00:25:00,05 --> 00:25:03,68
I don't i don't think there's anything else
going on here other than you know a few

352
00:25:03,68 --> 00:25:06,27
bright people sitting around
having fun and living their lives

353
00:25:06,27 --> 00:25:11,11
and there's still that focus. I guess
it's you know it's good for publicity.

354
00:25:11,30 --> 00:25:12,56
It was good for the p.r.

355
00:25:12,56 --> 00:25:16,20
In the 70s when it happened in that
you know there were a few naked tits

356
00:25:16,20 --> 00:25:17,33
and bottoms around

357
00:25:17,33 --> 00:25:23,42
and you know we're still bearing ourselves
to the national psyche god for v.

358
00:25:25,70 --> 00:25:29,83
Our time bill that people have to
fucking listened of people about sex.

359
00:25:29,90 --> 00:25:35,03
What do you still we all die.

360
00:25:35,04 --> 00:25:38,06
But i think it's part of the limits goes
both agree what of people come here.

361
00:25:38,71 --> 00:25:40,46
They've taken the women mr ha.

362
00:25:40,67 --> 00:25:45,14
My come here and always expectations
about what they expected to be

363
00:25:45,14 --> 00:25:51,57
when it doesn't live up to their their
expectations their dreams their allusions i.

364
00:25:52,19 --> 00:25:57,92
They blame in i've blown in the
north. I blame. Dramas like i blame.

365
00:25:59,26 --> 00:26:00,61
All this. I think that happens

366
00:26:00,61 --> 00:26:04,05
when people you know say couples
for example move to the country

367
00:26:04,05 --> 00:26:06,80
and think again the going to have
this you know we so in model.

368
00:26:08,47 --> 00:26:11,09
So start they have to spend
24 hours a day together.

369
00:26:11,35 --> 00:26:13,92
The kids are at home with them often.

370
00:26:14,01 --> 00:26:16,43
You know the sexually vision
of labor comes into play

371
00:26:16,43 --> 00:26:19,93
and then their lives fall
apart and they split up

372
00:26:19,93 --> 00:26:22,88
and they did back to the cities
having had a ghastly time and

373
00:26:22,88 --> 00:26:26,26
and again they blame whatever.

374
00:26:26,28 --> 00:26:31,65
But i mean we've lived here with those
ideals and those ideals of change.

375
00:26:31,67 --> 00:26:34,53
I mean we came here with a
lot of those original ideals

376
00:26:34,53 --> 00:26:36,65
and we've had to put those
ideals in the practice

377
00:26:36,65 --> 00:26:42,35
and what we've come up with now 20 years
down the line is as a result of putting

378
00:26:43,15 --> 00:26:48,43
those ideals into practice and they've
changed considerably and reality

379
00:26:48,43 --> 00:26:54,22
and the reality of living here the
reality of the changing economic times

380
00:26:54,22 --> 00:26:57,16
and social times and growing
older and children.

381
00:26:57,45 --> 00:27:02,42
We don't use tobacco leaf toilet paper
anymore dinner has changed. I mean.

382
00:27:02,44 --> 00:27:05,85
You know we came here we have
these ideals originally as well

383
00:27:05,85 --> 00:27:10,07
and i mean we're just adapted to
reality and. I mean life goes on.

384
00:27:10,33 --> 00:27:13,36
I mean you've just got to live a normal
life and i mean you can do that.

385
00:27:14,67 --> 00:27:17,05
You know with the practice
of change happening to you

386
00:27:17,76 --> 00:27:21,62
and just because i feel just because
the way we live. These days doesn't.

387
00:27:21,86 --> 00:27:28,42
Doesn't coincide with a lot of people's 70s
illusions about what i'll turn his life

388
00:27:28,42 --> 00:27:33,22
should be and because i see you know.

389
00:27:33,24 --> 00:27:38,31
They're all savages and not noble
savages on the side nimbin i mean

390
00:27:38,31 --> 00:27:42,67
that they then they then think
that the whole dream is filed

391
00:27:42,67 --> 00:27:44,67
and the whole thing as a disaster

392
00:27:44,67 --> 00:27:49,38
but really it's just it's just changed i
think that the fact that it's gone on

393
00:27:49,38 --> 00:27:53,30
and i think that it and turn
it has adapted basically prove

394
00:27:53,30 --> 00:27:55,69
that it's still alive and
well and it's still growing.

395
00:27:56,01 --> 00:27:59,77
You know that changes fashion
because 70s fashion is velvet.

396
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,02
It's and flowing locks is
really what people are used to

397
00:28:03,02 --> 00:28:06,86
and then you know it a bit surreal
staggering jury comes out people find

398
00:28:06,86 --> 00:28:11,11
that really confronting like i was listening
to somebody the other day going on

399
00:28:11,11 --> 00:28:14,21
about some some girl had
a bone in their nose

400
00:28:14,21 --> 00:28:18,21
and it was just like i was so horrified
i really profoundly disturbed by it

401
00:28:18,21 --> 00:28:22,61
and again it's just like that is exactly
the same as we were 20 years ago

402
00:28:22,61 --> 00:28:24,21
and i mean that's great. I love that.

403
00:28:24,30 --> 00:28:27,43
But that you know life can
evolve and that kids.

404
00:28:27,54 --> 00:28:30,87
I mean our kids have got something new
to do rather than wearing you know.

405
00:28:31,48 --> 00:28:34,81
Boring velvet and. Like you.

406
00:28:36,78 --> 00:28:40,35
You know. You know diction and.

407
00:28:40,73 --> 00:28:44,51
The fact that.

408
00:28:44,53 --> 00:28:53,97
You can i think you know i think.

409
00:28:53,99 --> 00:28:57,45
The statement. Yeah. Yeah well.

410
00:28:57,93 --> 00:29:02,55
Drugs are a very large part
of my life of for the first.

411
00:29:04,59 --> 00:29:09,60
12 or 13 years that i lived
here and. On every level.

412
00:29:09,83 --> 00:29:13,58
You know socially economically.

413
00:29:15,25 --> 00:29:17,96
They were they were a large part and.

414
00:29:17,98 --> 00:29:24,88
And i think i think i
needed you know i don't

415
00:29:24,88 --> 00:29:28,46
regret those days i think there
was good times and bad times

416
00:29:28,46 --> 00:29:35,30
and there was tragic times but. I think
that was what i needed to go through to to.

417
00:29:37,50 --> 00:29:41,61
To spiritually grow to evolve i mean
that whole drug thing something

418
00:29:41,61 --> 00:29:43,90
that i needed to go through and
come out the other end and

419
00:29:44,71 --> 00:29:46,66
and really it's something
that i had to experience

420
00:29:46,66 --> 00:29:53,51
and it's it's no good you know
counselors or judges or parents

421
00:29:53,51 --> 00:29:57,04
or anyone telling me what was
right and what was wrong

422
00:29:57,04 --> 00:30:02,29
and what was going to happen. Basically
on. I had to go through it and.

423
00:30:02,31 --> 00:30:04,12
I went through it and
came out the other end.

424
00:30:04,29 --> 00:30:08,14
Probably a lot stronger
and better off for it.

425
00:30:09,38 --> 00:30:13,39
Other people had and i mean other people
died along the way i was lucky i think.

426
00:30:13,91 --> 00:30:20,49
I think compared to a lot of my friends who
stayed in the city. I think living in.

427
00:30:20,50 --> 00:30:21,25
Living in this environment

428
00:30:22,03 --> 00:30:27,55
and in this community we're issues
were a lot more open and discussed

429
00:30:27,55 --> 00:30:30,39
and.

430
00:30:31,32 --> 00:30:36,30
Yeah i think i think i probably survived
my addiction a lot better than a lot of my

431
00:30:36,30 --> 00:30:38,90
friends in the city did and i think.

432
00:30:38,92 --> 00:30:43,60
You know on all levels on
particularly health wise.

433
00:30:43,62 --> 00:30:50,41
Emotionally i wasn't as i
wasn't isolated in the

434
00:30:50,41 --> 00:30:55,48
community here because of my diction
and i was i was taken for who i was

435
00:30:55,48 --> 00:30:58,86
and what i did not the fact that i
was just an addict. You know it.

436
00:31:00,72 --> 00:31:05,32
As time went like now you know addicts
are vilified pretty much and but.

437
00:31:05,82 --> 00:31:10,93
In the general society but in the
alternative community over the years

438
00:31:10,93 --> 00:31:17,07
when i was using. Not so much you are
basically if you're an addict i mean that

439
00:31:17,07 --> 00:31:21,78
that that came second to who
you were and how you acted.

440
00:31:21,79 --> 00:31:24,51
And so yeah i think.

441
00:31:26,48 --> 00:31:29,34
I think i was definitely better off
being an addict in the country

442
00:31:29,34 --> 00:31:30,47
but i was in the city.
