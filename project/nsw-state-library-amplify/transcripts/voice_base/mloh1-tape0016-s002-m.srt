1
00:00:03,80 --> 00:00:07,20
If you remember the
apprentices do you have

2
00:00:07,20 --> 00:00:13,99
a few one black i know in areas. He lives
in maria and the room or rather you know

3
00:00:14,71 --> 00:00:21,39
like named kennedy. Do you remember. Any

4
00:00:21,40 --> 00:00:28,30
anything amusing that used to go on
around there. Not really i don't think

5
00:00:30,58 --> 00:00:35,81
i don't think i did because i kept the
mostly to me suffer my girlfriend. We never

6
00:00:35,81 --> 00:00:42,00
talked about much yet together we use our
dances every friday night and all of the

7
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:46,25
time you know really good night because i
don't even that nineteen of the twenty

8
00:00:46,25 --> 00:00:52,23
you know and. The scotts a great one
for the thing and the answer is

9
00:00:52,23 --> 00:00:56,41
a play for girls occasions and we get the
name of the other things they support on

10
00:00:56,41 --> 00:00:58,89
the you know better. Ball or whatever
the ball over time that night on

11
00:00:58,89 --> 00:01:02,34
a friday night everybody. Know it and
they get on the grog just like there's

12
00:01:02,34 --> 00:01:07,88
a back home brew y bit but it was wine or
whiskey or something like that would be

13
00:01:07,88 --> 00:01:11,78
ok but you know he was going all right.
Really good night. So they raised him and

14
00:01:11,78 --> 00:01:15,22
that settled everything up. They
cut it all out then you know he's

15
00:01:15,22 --> 00:01:20,29
a bloody classic that night

16
00:01:22,54 --> 00:01:29,21
. You know then at the turn itself the
dancers used to play the fiddle. Yeah yeah

17
00:01:29,21 --> 00:01:34,58
yeah. And where do you find the rest of the
band where no fiddle player there where

18
00:01:34,58 --> 00:01:36,40
the piano. There they come
from there and they had

19
00:01:36,40 --> 00:01:40,34
a drum of their i don't know with anyone
else what else they had because i can't

20
00:01:40,34 --> 00:01:43,94
think back that far. I know that
it's about the fiddle and there's

21
00:01:43,94 --> 00:01:48,72
a play but i think you know but by jeez
i tell you what we're some nights. Good

22
00:01:48,72 --> 00:01:54,51
nights. Do you remember the the crushing
of the aggregate. How was that done.

23
00:01:57,95 --> 00:02:02,70
What's that. Well you know the stone
waste was crushed for for metal for the

24
00:02:02,70 --> 00:02:09,22
concrete and that while i don't i don't
think that done that down there. I don't

25
00:02:09,22 --> 00:02:14,04
remember that back in the crushing public
trashing plant there could have been one

26
00:02:14,04 --> 00:02:18,54
that used to take it. I think they brought
out the breakwater maria breakwater out

27
00:02:18,54 --> 00:02:21,92
of the way stuff that came from
there. There must have been

28
00:02:21,92 --> 00:02:26,30
a crushing machine because it used to go
in the bottom these to put it all the all

29
00:02:26,30 --> 00:02:31,36
the aggregate in the bottom of the of the
ships. Yeah i don't remember that that

30
00:02:31,36 --> 00:02:34,01
part of it because i didn't take much
notice of that one interesting part of it

31
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:37,71
that could be done at the back.
But i never remember of it. Of

32
00:02:37,71 --> 00:02:42,52
a crashing plane could have been on there
and when you finished or how did you

33
00:02:42,52 --> 00:02:48,12
finish up there. Well i got
hurt on the foot there i went i

34
00:02:49,43 --> 00:02:52,38
got right i just left and
come back to sydney against

35
00:02:52,38 --> 00:02:56,14
a worldly it was the end of the job and he
was nearly cut people out and would have

36
00:02:56,14 --> 00:02:59,97
been there much many more months because
that was the last of it all the other part

37
00:02:59,97 --> 00:03:06,49
of you done. Did you get a job again
in sydney i came to sydney. Did i get

38
00:03:06,49 --> 00:03:13,40
a job in sydney now thirty one. Well i

39
00:03:13,40 --> 00:03:18,66
can't. When now i think
things was a bit bad that was

40
00:03:18,66 --> 00:03:23,91
a depression and i see you to get
little jobs in my get a week

41
00:03:23,91 --> 00:03:28,85
a year around i pretended i gained on
doing freestone something like that until

00:03:28,86 --> 00:03:33,16
things got a bit better later
on then i buy them if i get

43
00:03:33,16 --> 00:03:36,61
a couple of years you've got lucky to get

48
00:03:55,53 --> 00:04:01,04
realize you were on the dole yourself. No
i couldn't get it because ultimately home

49
00:04:01,04 --> 00:04:04,25
. I just got a week's
work out your parent had

50
00:04:04,25 --> 00:04:06,57
a keeper couldn't get the phone not want

52
00:04:10,41 --> 00:04:14,78
me your father working there.
What was he working as

53
00:04:14,78 --> 00:04:19,11
a dairy farmers isn't tied to the horses
the dairy farms. Was it round here round

54
00:04:19,11 --> 00:04:24,89
a basket. Down there and i could if i got

55
00:04:24,89 --> 00:04:30,34
a job later on i got plenty of work
after worked on the i got onto the to

56
00:04:30,35 --> 00:04:34,39
a place called this down yard over here.
I used to go over there and work at

57
00:04:34,39 --> 00:04:40,17
different times when you want to me like i
might i might not get no pay it when you

58
00:04:40,17 --> 00:04:44,38
sold us. We sold a stone or sold some
stuff i'd get a pay out of it then my get

59
00:04:44,38 --> 00:04:49,61
a dollar to dollar something like
that and then it. We got got

60
00:04:49,61 --> 00:04:53,95
a job it can be around the i think
it was the lot. The. And that was

61
00:04:53,95 --> 00:04:56,86
a war museum all the
flagging for it. I think was

62
00:04:56,86 --> 00:05:02,87
a museum in nineteen that come
later or nineteen coming to 1940.

63
00:05:03,96 --> 00:05:10,45
Was forty. Cause i was married
and then i started then because

64
00:05:12,59 --> 00:05:18,10
after that graving dock came on the garden
island driving dock and of course we

65
00:05:18,10 --> 00:05:22,62
were i was in the army for about two weeks
taken out to go into the dock because

66
00:05:22,62 --> 00:05:25,83
that was more important. I reckon
and that was of was with with

67
00:05:25,83 --> 00:05:30,28
a broomstick or actually or something to
remember who was in charge of the grabbing

68
00:05:30,28 --> 00:05:36,91
the. No there are four firms out it

69
00:05:38,07 --> 00:05:42,15
seems but i was told that james muir who
was in charge of the sydney harbour bridge

70
00:05:42,15 --> 00:05:43,42
that was on it. I had

71
00:05:43,42 --> 00:05:49,44
a name familiar. You could have been but
i i didn't i was in the yard see and act

72
00:05:49,44 --> 00:05:53,26
and in i was in we were i would act and
they are here. Estonia used to be here.

73
00:05:54,24 --> 00:06:00,74
That was when it works. There was they be
acton's in alexandria. There were so and

74
00:06:00,74 --> 00:06:06,47
does that. Pain to know

75
00:06:07,66 --> 00:06:12,74
and love and hutchins up lewisham they were
forum at that set up between them. Well

76
00:06:12,74 --> 00:06:18,25
after all the stones that were similar to
the similar work to the to the to the to

77
00:06:18,25 --> 00:06:23,37
the parlance. But there wasn't much rough
inner. Rough work but all faced when done

78
00:06:23,37 --> 00:06:26,92
by sorting it then it will be will
be about to get a stone about

79
00:06:26,92 --> 00:06:28,26
a ton you cut in about four and

80
00:06:28,26 --> 00:06:31,30
a half time of the time to be cut down
and checked out and finished for the one

81
00:06:31,30 --> 00:06:34,94
that was all i'm going to work with bevels
there and gauges and strategies. That'll

82
00:06:34,94 --> 00:06:40,87
be perfect watertight gateways not the
keeping on the top as well. Right. After

83
00:06:40,87 --> 00:06:44,57
that was all finished they were checked
by inspectors every week your tools are

84
00:06:44,57 --> 00:06:49,01
used straight edges and squares were all
checked every week and when it was all

85
00:06:49,01 --> 00:06:55,71
completed they spat all fit perfect. And
when i went down to the when it and i said

86
00:06:55,71 --> 00:06:59,02
it all up on the dock. They took a check

87
00:06:59,02 --> 00:07:01,11
a sight of my again or some might
have been an eighth of an inch

88
00:07:01,11 --> 00:07:05,97
a quarter inch out and weary face all
those down on the job in the dock itself

89
00:07:05,97 --> 00:07:08,100
that's where the gates go along and
they float and i come down out of

90
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,96
a perfect. No water have

91
00:07:11,81 --> 00:07:15,18
a face on there and what are going
to be no good because the right dog

92
00:07:15,18 --> 00:07:17,29
a flood. So that'll be a strategy put

93
00:07:17,29 --> 00:07:20,29
a strategy all along and you
look right down or you put

94
00:07:20,29 --> 00:07:24,23
a cigarette paper down between the back.
Well that's out perfect it had to be. And

95
00:07:24,23 --> 00:07:28,86
we were then if about nine months on those
that been set in already before it was

96
00:07:28,86 --> 00:07:32,78
used and that's like that big gates along
flood i mean they bring them all and i

97
00:07:32,78 --> 00:07:34,91
find they've got champers
on their they go like

98
00:07:34,91 --> 00:07:41,10
a bull no no. Top you know come along and
champion and coming straight down to join

99
00:07:41,10 --> 00:07:41,57
me to get

100
00:07:41,57 --> 00:07:46,67
a nice reverse side and then they fit it
drops the gate. Comes along when the water

101
00:07:46,67 --> 00:07:53,34
is there and they flood that down minutes
when that thing is set down they pump the

102
00:07:53,34 --> 00:07:59,57
water out and it's the dry dock that's out
has to be perfect it was that was the

103
00:07:59,57 --> 00:08:04,92
work more exacting or just about the same
as how it was it was more exacting but

104
00:08:04,93 --> 00:08:09,37
the bridge was near it was it was pretty
purp because you had all these bubbles to

105
00:08:09,37 --> 00:08:12,69
go boy to go by all these people's and
that the different size fourteen foot as i

106
00:08:12,69 --> 00:08:16,46
said before forty one fall into fourteen
trees and that's all you've ever goes up

107
00:08:16,46 --> 00:08:21,58
so you get different stones different you
know to get them so they come in. I don't

108
00:08:21,58 --> 00:08:25,40
see that any trouble in there when they
set them. Well it was only to masons the

109
00:08:25,40 --> 00:08:31,79
side two two on the north pole and two
in the south. I don't know them well

110
00:08:31,79 --> 00:08:36,30
i've got their names and there's none of
them alive and well i think there's one of

111
00:08:36,30 --> 00:08:40,45
them alive. If i knew their names i might
have known them but i wouldn't have known

112
00:08:40,45 --> 00:08:45,21
in those articles as i say i just come
out of my time and they'd be probably

113
00:08:45,21 --> 00:08:49,55
a lot of our base i mean they'd be some
you never see that right around one time.

114
00:08:50,32 --> 00:08:55,84
Tell me when you in your time. How long
was your apprenticeship five years. And

115
00:08:55,84 --> 00:09:01,12
during the procedure. During the apprenticeship
how did you start. I started by and

116
00:09:01,12 --> 00:09:06,84
abilities first and us then after
about running around i give you

117
00:09:06,84 --> 00:09:10,41
a bit of stone to make around
with a hammer a punch around not

118
00:09:10,41 --> 00:09:14,75
a bit often you do something else and after
about twelve states that you know then

119
00:09:15,58 --> 00:09:19,56
and then they give you. We don't. The first
job that i worked on in the stone game

120
00:09:19,56 --> 00:09:24,14
was the other government in the bank as
i told you before all that it'll called

121
00:09:24,14 --> 00:09:27,83
around the top water in the top but other
than you. I mean there must be two or

122
00:09:27,83 --> 00:09:32,09
three hundred guys right around the top
and we that was our i got fighters i mean

123
00:09:32,09 --> 00:09:37,78
the you'd like to see them signing when
you're ready and then we started off then

124
00:09:38,56 --> 00:09:42,51
you get on to other work then
as you progress and seen a job

125
00:09:42,51 --> 00:09:45,84
a job you made them but you've got better
and better and better and that's how you

126
00:09:45,84 --> 00:09:52,64
you move on. Do you end up cutting large
blocks to you on the graving dock

127
00:09:52,64 --> 00:09:59,03
and but on these other the
other job down here the the

128
00:10:01,39 --> 00:10:05,03
way i caught the tech station department
oppose what they call that place now that

129
00:10:05,03 --> 00:10:06,22
was all done by swords and

130
00:10:06,22 --> 00:10:10,85
a lot that were done by machinery but some
some stones they were never worked on in

131
00:10:10,85 --> 00:10:14,67
the six weeks to make it six weeks to polish
some of those ones to get over the top

132
00:10:14,67 --> 00:10:21,48
those grow and weeks go and. There anything
you. Else that you comes to mind about

133
00:10:21,48 --> 00:10:28,43
the career maria on the harbor
bridge work. I know i'd only

134
00:10:28,43 --> 00:10:28,66
put

135
00:10:28,66 --> 00:10:34,10
a car over there. I can't take this girl
to batemans bay one day and one of these

136
00:10:34,10 --> 00:10:35,10
pac ads i think was

137
00:10:35,10 --> 00:10:41,33
a packard. Or one between those days to be
you know again and not down the road to

138
00:10:41,33 --> 00:10:42,72
well until you put up with

139
00:10:42,72 --> 00:10:45,73
a ben record that would have been not
talked about for up and then come back

140
00:10:45,73 --> 00:10:50,95
they're going to make million from batemans
bay tomorrow it will make. Even i don't

141
00:10:50,95 --> 00:10:54,84
know about ninety you know i do any experience
in country roads and down the quarry

142
00:10:54,84 --> 00:10:58,58
a few times or sloppy and you get that mad
and you know you've got to get out of it

143
00:10:58,58 --> 00:11:04,23
and i say turn the car and then the
other part you play of as i did use

144
00:11:04,23 --> 00:11:08,65
a plaintiff in the football team
then oh yeah but they called

145
00:11:08,65 --> 00:11:09,43
a scratch game went on

146
00:11:10,15 --> 00:11:15,42
a soccer. I would know soccer from rugby.
If i played it but we had to go get our

147
00:11:15,42 --> 00:11:19,36
long tree and the quarry and it versus the
stonemasons everything was in boots and

148
00:11:19,36 --> 00:11:25,89
all in the long. That's an hour race course.
Where was the race course still down

149
00:11:25,89 --> 00:11:31,95
south in the morale of the town. So we're
used to play soccer there. Now that's

150
00:11:31,95 --> 00:11:33,40
where we used to go. Not all the time

151
00:11:33,40 --> 00:11:36,02
a few to and we tried you know
when they when they declared us on

152
00:11:36,02 --> 00:11:42,20
a weekly they won boots on
or in any cricket match.

153
00:11:43,41 --> 00:11:43,55
What

154
00:11:43,56 --> 00:11:47,100
a good enough for them. It sounds of the
scots or in charge their socks. I were in

155
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,92
charge of everything they were

156
00:11:49,92 --> 00:11:56,26
a great team of people great what was soccer
in the dancing really good really good

157
00:11:57,18 --> 00:12:04,14
