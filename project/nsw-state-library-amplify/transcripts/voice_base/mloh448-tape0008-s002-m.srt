1
00:00:01,74 --> 00:00:10,00
Now I had all I've been doing my famous party tree. What I'm going to brother.

2
00:00:10,95 --> 00:00:17,88
Today was my original one by Jane Fonda to Jane Pyle doing today.

3
00:00:17,91 --> 00:00:25,73
Now to get your smug done done done as it then went to always something they didn't know me

4
00:00:26,2 --> 00:00:35,67
but I I done that big number with Johnson's baby had it on my face at politics but just thought yes.

5
00:00:36,39 --> 00:00:42,69
Were any of them were any of the bills that ended up with these photos used to do some of the shows in the social plus

6
00:00:42,69 --> 00:00:51,43
guns as you know it isn't done kind of the devil and all that came out of us to the Germans

7
00:00:51,43 --> 00:00:52,47
and relentless to fearful

8
00:00:52,47 --> 00:00:59,95
and he was soon duty to my knowledge I would be very surprised if edition don't sneak missile that was used in the

9
00:00:59,95 --> 00:01:08,65
ninja Dozier daytime knows a bit about some of the votes and some of the stuff for the been some.

10
00:01:09,34 --> 00:01:15,74
Some of the well the parties of most of these things which but that I'm going to go back to the fifty's.

11
00:01:15,8 --> 00:01:20,2
It was the doing yes well at that time NY.

12
00:01:20,46 --> 00:01:26,34
My knowledge of drag being was totally confined to hearing stories

13
00:01:26,34 --> 00:01:33,12
and only once going to the office pool where Carol when you beat him drifts in and beat dress with Tracy.

14
00:01:33,26 --> 00:01:41,86
The wind in a beat him just increment in the pen take the can G.'s to run and that was all great great great fun too.

15
00:01:41,87 --> 00:01:48,75
What if the year it was the scientists of the soldiers or whatever it was kind and the queen stuff to get bashed

16
00:01:48,75 --> 00:01:54,98
or you don't it will still be obvious full yet squish that sadist softens a what if it was

17
00:01:54,98 --> 00:02:02,42
and they just fade away then this is what it got so I want to know the. Early early early.

18
00:02:03,74 --> 00:02:13,88
This is quite the drag balls like fifty's I think all sixty set was day with the end it was what once a year up it is

19
00:02:13,88 --> 00:02:17,03
sure those girls would see that would be they would come home in that seat here

20
00:02:17,03 --> 00:02:25,52
and they'd be taken for prevail you know sort of thing and that was my first carom is in drag.

21
00:02:25,99 --> 00:02:33,74
They are going to those sort of outfits and still and then be going to those outfits and going to parties in drag

22
00:02:33,74 --> 00:02:42,23
and people getting dressed up to go to parties and dress lace raiding and steroids but you know having you know.

23
00:02:44,01 --> 00:02:49,55
Music is good for the know it's the Queen's improved isn't being good.

24
00:02:49,63 --> 00:02:58,46
I did in the famous stories cabinet apart and meat and the place about utility. Yes I mean there are a lot.

25
00:02:58,49 --> 00:03:06,21
Cindy criminal types and so just sell not substance side as they are and done.

26
00:03:06,6 --> 00:03:13,02
The woman was there with the baby Sunday afternoon putting her to it's usually done by just part of the day we then get

27
00:03:13,02 --> 00:03:15,47
into by good friends a C.

28
00:03:15,47 --> 00:03:24,52
Would put a head in somebody with transit officers they could use you know just I'm just whipped through the day.

29
00:03:24,54 --> 00:03:30,09
Don't ya know I'm something that they used to rape they know I mean

30
00:03:30,09 --> 00:03:39,09
and I remember them writing of a canned fruit of being eighteen especially nineteen coming out of the back fence

31
00:03:39,09 --> 00:03:49,51
and going down the end of events when it starts in St it more. No that was said in the US So where was the bond.

32
00:03:49,52 --> 00:03:56,4
I could loose street you know there was a part of a job. The group cleans the offices of age.

33
00:03:56,6 --> 00:04:00,82
I need to know is what doing stand stays up there was some.

34
00:04:01,79 --> 00:04:08,88
I got at that stage I guess property and it's realized the queens are pretty good tenants except for those days

35
00:04:09,17 --> 00:04:14,79
but if they can get all Queens. You can without with police.

36
00:04:14,86 --> 00:04:24,95
Really acting suspicious of their noise complaints and and you know they wouldn't know the uterus.

37
00:04:25,27 --> 00:04:30,83
By then they'd go once and see the main drag will see that there is a mirror.

38
00:04:30,85 --> 00:04:34,89
I don't know what they arrest them and charge them for I'm not sure.

39
00:04:35,05 --> 00:04:41,7
Lex with that they just arrested them took them to the station Kuntz them up to whatever I don't know what they charged

40
00:04:41,7 --> 00:04:42,02
him for

41
00:04:42,02 --> 00:04:53,17
or if in fact any charges were laid there it is going to the fifty's was a great theory was to lose in the process you

42
00:04:53,17 --> 00:04:56,59
know use his that was a very and he could lose sieges alone.

43
00:04:56,73 --> 00:05:03,93
And as a recast was Mr Justice Minister for sure if they did they charged him.

44
00:05:04,01 --> 00:05:10,97
I'm not I'm not sure what the charge what they did to the people they used to they used to work

45
00:05:10,97 --> 00:05:18,32
but it's very well it's a different kettle of fish like being picked up on a big you could be just a defensive Caviezel

46
00:05:18,32 --> 00:05:20,43
yeah whatever you want to party.

47
00:05:20,6 --> 00:05:26,18
You know I don't like that of course it was like everything in those days we would just points just didn't know

48
00:05:26,18 --> 00:05:31,58
and the place where really that's thirty feet at the day they aren't anymore.

49
00:05:31,77 --> 00:05:36,79
You know when they have somebody sitting on Steven's related again the other night or something

50
00:05:36,79 --> 00:05:43,13
and I still I think that's pretty good i hope more rights happen because the queens are now just getting east of the

51
00:05:43,13 --> 00:05:43,57
place ready.

52
00:05:43,77 --> 00:05:49,81
Instead of being the great shock cause they're just the same as stand out years

53
00:05:49,81 --> 00:06:07,23
and years they've never bothered me is nice to see the other. Stink bombs around town and they do again real gains.

54
00:06:08,15 --> 00:06:15,32
You see little Tyler two for three norms amount of trouble with police writing again and again and again

55
00:06:15,32 --> 00:06:17,55
and again he stopped selling booze but kept writing.

56
00:06:18,06 --> 00:06:23,75
It's a marker for anyone who works in to they just presumed he wasn't shelling out the extra money for the young you

57
00:06:23,75 --> 00:06:28,95
know protection to get Neil Taylor in to the barracks at the same time.

58
00:06:30,22 --> 00:06:34,14
Yes Dylan's of ours and the other players there with no licenses.

59
00:06:34,24 --> 00:06:38,88
Yeah well he hasn't got any of those losses you know what I mean is if you've got somebody who's operating on those

60
00:06:38,88 --> 00:06:40,35
levels if they don't pay for that

61
00:06:40,92 --> 00:06:49,26
or was a great young as well if they just know that the combination is yes yes I think that would be like I just think

62
00:06:49,26 --> 00:06:54,13
that's a bit of beeches arithmetic said that they were down on the state does that I do.

63
00:06:54,57 --> 00:07:04,18
I doubt that any steam about these money if you put Leigh careen Yes fun. Yes that's true that's different.

64
00:07:04,5 --> 00:07:06,29
Yes but if you don't have makeup.

65
00:07:06,33 --> 00:07:13,23
I do doubt that any of them pay on a bus level with just you're a person

66
00:07:15,5 --> 00:07:28,16
when I was in the parking spots to yeah it would be easy to but not of the knights

67
00:07:28,16 --> 00:07:36,88
and to the civil carry stuff that was the second step. Yes the storms of the games.

68
00:07:36,92 --> 00:07:42,05
I started that are going to be seen through the course of this because I just get so sick again as we should do nothing

69
00:07:42,65 --> 00:07:47,66
really to most of the next ten trying to do this I could see how much money was being made

70
00:07:47,66 --> 00:07:57,71
and you know you just need a plane there. Asheville is just go go go. And I can read it can absolutely. And you know.

71
00:07:58,42 --> 00:08:08,00
And fortunately the brand with the. So wasteful. It was too far and it wasn't well done and if it's case.

72
00:08:08,39 --> 00:08:18,91
Well it was a very big lesson and fortunately at that time I was able to negotiate to buy that building

73
00:08:20,56 --> 00:08:29,08
and having bought that building. You're insane. It's wrong and I was able to read The Lord Mayor. You know his name.

74
00:08:29,31 --> 00:08:36,83
It wasn't a good. There's no no and no name and straight.

75
00:08:36,93 --> 00:08:40,01
Yeah yeah yeah that's it really say here

76
00:08:40,01 --> 00:08:48,52
and what they were quite aware of what was over they just what they were what they inject into it went through trust

77
00:08:48,52 --> 00:08:53,31
but objected to on the grounds that there was no parking facilities here.

78
00:08:53,59 --> 00:08:55,27
And finally I went to him

79
00:08:55,27 --> 00:09:04,61
and say look I'm conducting a business in your municipality all I'm doing it is moving it from one six into another you

80
00:09:04,61 --> 00:09:08,59
can all children hold me up I said I hope that building.

81
00:09:08,59 --> 00:09:16,97
I'm ready to go even use it in the past so you really haven't read what's going on and on the Net Not much.

82
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:24,73
Now it was you know he says he even said to me it would be nearly seventy two

83
00:09:24,73 --> 00:09:32,87
or late seventy one that I didn't because I was there for about a year and then I came down

84
00:09:32,87 --> 00:09:37,85
and we actually came down here this was still running as the book on the net had been derelict for us to be

85
00:09:37,85 --> 00:09:43,6
and this is why I know was I able to get it through because he pointed out that this guarantee building that was being

86
00:09:43,6 --> 00:09:47,2
inhabited by drunks and their things sending if you buddy.

87
00:09:47,26 --> 00:09:54,61
While I was prepared to do something with that and that's how we actually got through it. I wasn't there.

88
00:09:54,79 --> 00:10:01,11
The comedian didn't understand that's it and I said no no no it's it's like it's always had a dreadful repeated.

89
00:10:01,88 --> 00:10:03,4
As a kind of sexual home.

90
00:10:04,75 --> 00:10:11,4
I understand in the nation from a professor of you know this duty stuff was called Radcliffe who lives around his son

91
00:10:11,98 --> 00:10:22,34
and he's always done that about you from time to time that I just retired I think in the last two years at phoning

92
00:10:22,34 --> 00:10:26,54
myself like you know people think this is just wonderful.

93
00:10:28,5 --> 00:10:34,69
Well we know he's not we don't isolate the outside world for the Yes You know nothing father anybody who's a face would

94
00:10:34,76 --> 00:10:41,57
just think they didn't they knew everything couldn't be all you could get a council meeting saying

95
00:10:41,71 --> 00:10:47,82
and Professor read from the University of New South Wales gathered up that this hideous place seniors attracting our

96
00:10:47,82 --> 00:10:55,32
young people and you know things like when you do whatever they thought you going to claim holds up for the company.

97
00:10:57,98 --> 00:10:59,12
I suppose to all intents

98
00:10:59,12 --> 00:11:06,35
and purposes see to get into rand week at Rand week I had taken out a legitimate health studio that's the only way I

99
00:11:06,35 --> 00:11:14,52
could get it. I suppose I feel studio. That was already established as a studio here but it's like you.

100
00:11:14,52 --> 00:11:18,09
They've made it there. You're just transferring is just existing operating a studio.

101
00:11:18,21 --> 00:11:28,79
Then it was free from the film going to whoever would find out about it about what if what they never found out

102
00:11:28,79 --> 00:11:38,66
and ran because they would never be transferred and I don't know how they got a buck when they were robbed on Monday

103
00:11:38,66 --> 00:11:45,71
and the detective came in just in what you already have some cases like that's where it's gone to see what your point

104
00:11:45,71 --> 00:11:53,76
here but I remember I witnessed it five years ago I would say to Steve driver.

105
00:11:53,99 --> 00:12:02,43
You know and you know the work I think we did that I never did that there either. It changes with weights.

106
00:12:02,85 --> 00:12:19,41
I don't just said you know but he just called that really is to say oh you know even lots of good people.

107
00:12:19,69 --> 00:12:28,44
This is a bunch of guy who is at the end I was very lucky to be out here in Kensington because of the three of us to

108
00:12:30,04 --> 00:12:43,29
see his days as to what it is. It'll be but I think I may be lucky as a city in this case on Monday.

109
00:12:43,32 --> 00:12:49,41
I think is different. Somebody with you and I I don't employ straight.

110
00:12:51,58 --> 00:13:06,58
It's a little soft and you think that was the best time and they got into a German boy called down on son Chance

111
00:13:06,58 --> 00:13:13,44
and showed us what you can do you think you know as well as not

112
00:13:13,44 --> 00:13:20,36
and so we don't know what we're supposed to sing like in the fifty's and in those three huge cuts.

113
00:13:20,45 --> 00:13:28,39
It would have been Wilson Yes the ricks was the highlight place that was with the rock

114
00:13:28,39 --> 00:13:35,14
when I was eighteen I didn't sort of know that camp until I was eighteen and somebody picked me up

115
00:13:35,14 --> 00:13:41,29
and took me up to do it just to that stage I was the only eighteen year old in there with little

116
00:13:41,29 --> 00:13:47,57
and went up to the Greeks and it was off to the rate she would by the bottles of booze

117
00:13:47,57 --> 00:13:52,29
and go to the pound Chiles Black was about his days

118
00:13:52,29 --> 00:13:59,05
and he would sort of say that he's just he's mother father the way he says you can't say that you were black

119
00:13:59,05 --> 00:13:59,71
or anything.

120
00:14:01,8 --> 00:14:06,41
Well can they you know a story becomes a vacuum that's just going to get around in the kids

121
00:14:06,41 --> 00:14:15,21
and it is going to be because it's a very it's going to give a sense of the rights of the place where we will go say.

122
00:14:15,7 --> 00:14:23,88
And you're like my father that he was easy going to then he had everybody under russian their beaks hottest goals

123
00:14:23,88 --> 00:14:29,77
slamming him taxis would be you know that was with apologies.

124
00:14:30,75 --> 00:14:43,07
In fact you never in the fifty's identi gave an organized party because she just needed everybody says yes that's right

125
00:14:43,07 --> 00:14:49,11
and you need to organize the party in your own place because she just knew that it would be up to fix in ten minutes

126
00:14:49,14 --> 00:14:56,72
and you could expect the only time that they had hockey is I think the parties that I've been to were sort of like long

127
00:14:56,72 --> 00:15:04,63
weekends where you eat all the way down to Newport and it was it rented cottage and all that interposed.

128
00:15:04,97 --> 00:15:13,24
Is this idea of what we did but I think they would Rickson rage or whatever their names were on the station

129
00:15:13,34 --> 00:15:19,01
but just we went to the ice to get instant in your hotel then it was called the centennial

130
00:15:19,32 --> 00:15:24,87
and Bruce form of would be playing there and lined up to say listen to the rough numbers

131
00:15:24,9 --> 00:15:32,86
and we used to have wildly hole their tempi and they used to hot he used to hog the whole day they listen.

132
00:15:32,89 --> 00:15:34,77
Is that you know they all the talking.

133
00:15:35,09 --> 00:15:39,24
Oh I was so yeah just Sinton then and they all used to get back there

134
00:15:39,24 --> 00:15:42,29
and Bruce would take the band back to their land and would cost a treat.

135
00:15:42,29 --> 00:15:54,16
I was getting that was where Office came in contact again we rough a numbers where up until then I had no concept that

136
00:15:54,16 --> 00:16:01,22
square now this would get off if you know all that it's we know this would be attractive to news.

137
00:16:03,41 --> 00:16:06,39
The next step up from the day when criminals will say this

138
00:16:06,39 --> 00:16:13,75
or whatever they would that push the next step up was the drag queen syndrome where those tough little boys from

139
00:16:13,75 --> 00:16:16,4
Paddington needed to do things

140
00:16:16,97 --> 00:16:27,12
and from then on square trade's just being sort of I thought a little bit as if their luck that it got seeps through to

141
00:16:27,12 --> 00:16:30,94
the queen's that just because they persuade didn't mean they wouldn't be so I don't know.

142
00:16:31,23 --> 00:16:36,85
We'll see this from my mother who works at two five three says nearly thirty defeats regular KLEIN You know her

143
00:16:36,85 --> 00:16:43,73
sexually married me who you know I don't like coming here for dates so old guy six run.

144
00:16:44,53 --> 00:16:50,96
So there's a bonus points for the people who use six Lot guy six lives you've done the work in Michael's part secrecy

145
00:16:51,18 --> 00:16:57,88
and Yes Well it's nice to think that Steve does not always film that is there for the smoothness of having to get all

146
00:16:58,02 --> 00:17:06,09
your receiving which suppose for most of the rest of the most of the books is in the east

147
00:17:06,09 --> 00:17:11,6
and so was this that loosens up so let's study at the start.

148
00:17:11,63 --> 00:17:17,74
It's more countries to try to he makes a point that most of the guys doing stuff with their strike

149
00:17:17,74 --> 00:17:23,16
or heterosexual here and he was clever about he and someone else they sat outside

150
00:17:23,16 --> 00:17:25,73
and took a number plate to the cause of it

151
00:17:25,73 --> 00:17:30,47
when there's a kind of encrypted light wrongly for to their children best to go to the government it's kind of that

152
00:17:30,47 --> 00:17:35,25
they didn't attend the retreat this together because he was a sociologist of university

153
00:17:35,25 --> 00:17:38,44
and they were doing the whole study that was doing this. No study of me.

154
00:17:38,52 --> 00:17:41,92
You're just here to tell the addresses and shove them in as well.

155
00:17:42,16 --> 00:17:44,29
I didn't have nothing to do with the study

156
00:17:44,29 --> 00:17:50,31
but it was a way of getting find out you know that you know the fact is situations it's always been there was a huge

157
00:17:50,31 --> 00:17:56,59
drop out there then was everybody did afterwards going to the gun interview always played with the Course to go to

158
00:17:56,59 --> 00:18:01,09
digest to get a bit of being such a gentleman here. It was a huge row about it because people said he was.

159
00:18:01,38 --> 00:18:08,95
What is he doing at Humphrey's because it really is wonderful books I used to go into the toilets of course I'd stand

160
00:18:08,95 --> 00:18:09,33
at the door

161
00:18:09,33 --> 00:18:14,12
and just watch because it was always somebody if it was just me from the police would I see a store stand

162
00:18:14,63 --> 00:18:21,24
and just this is my story and there are one point where he got a risk to stand up to the standing watches

163
00:18:21,24 --> 00:18:24,21
and the police took him back to the police station and he's and something

164
00:18:24,21 --> 00:18:26,2
or another he got all these you know just me

165
00:18:26,76 --> 00:18:31,51
and he said I'd like you to call my wife I'm going to come down the aisle and they say

166
00:18:31,64 --> 00:18:38,95
but because he was you know it was a freak the place up tight with a sign you know get the wife down a year ago she

167
00:18:38,95 --> 00:18:45,23
knew exactly what he was doing well I don't know that she did because it was about five is after that that he did this

168
00:18:45,23 --> 00:18:47,83
is a here in volume I have not had to do doing research.

169
00:18:47,92 --> 00:18:49,73
So that's why I was hanging around to be sure

170
00:18:49,73 --> 00:18:55,36
but I don't think I think in truth that he was good enough governance I mean I just this raised a badly kind played on

171
00:18:55,36 --> 00:18:55,73
news.

172
00:18:55,83 --> 00:19:06,51
You know you didn't take that piece of roots down I'm not questioning if we were discussing us like James face facts.

173
00:19:06,83 --> 00:19:08,01
Does he run

174
00:19:08,01 --> 00:19:17,8
and beat was an apprentice at Down Yonder he deceived him it was an apprentice at the sun here we're going to think it

175
00:19:17,8 --> 00:19:25,1
and then it was it printed at the whatever that thing is and he said during the strike. Sue in the first place.

176
00:19:25,17 --> 00:19:32,16
Yes at during the strikes those boys always sleep there and James used to come down

177
00:19:32,16 --> 00:19:40,76
and I said Well no I don't believe that's just friendship testing Genesis to show that that I think we Gentry's always

178
00:19:40,76 --> 00:19:46,53
advisable as whatever he was managing director of Fairfax to be talked to on the editorial lines was

179
00:19:46,53 --> 00:19:49,66
or no human policy.

180
00:19:49,8 --> 00:19:55,57
Yes I've only met him once I was I was introduced in the trade rather for trade back in seventy two

181
00:19:55,57 --> 00:20:01,11
and he well he was managing director of it but.

182
00:20:01,3 --> 00:20:10,04
He used to talk about Sid No I didn't describe the rest of the job of checking up about reducing what I printed which I

183
00:20:10,04 --> 00:20:13,4
said was nothing that he said oh no that's not true and I said Look.

184
00:20:13,54 --> 00:20:19,76
OK you got shipped with ivory because you got a lot of the things I missed so he went to the trouble of taking these

185
00:20:19,76 --> 00:20:21,08
like the writing that C.G.

186
00:20:21,08 --> 00:20:28,7
Did drugs and since then I've corresponded to the point where if I send letters in that they don't get published.

187
00:20:28,79 --> 00:20:35,36
I usually send the copy of it in the eyes of the I'll just drop even though it's a good thing still out of hearing you

188
00:20:35,36 --> 00:20:41,34
know but you know yes in the end he just you know the issue of those who sort of kept in touch to that one.

189
00:20:41,4 --> 00:20:47,33
I've been waiting to go back and have another talk to people is the situation really was getting ludicrous.

190
00:20:47,41 --> 00:20:55,4
But of course in the last year or so the Herald is finally cracked and is is running stuff for us

191
00:20:55,4 --> 00:21:02,97
but we all got to talk to them because with these bill comes back up to the next election.

192
00:21:03,42 --> 00:21:06,61
Our years see the times come

193
00:21:06,61 --> 00:21:14,6
and I see that considered seriously their will to run for president of the ordeal at the crucial time

194
00:21:14,6 --> 00:21:25,9
and we'll talk about it. Yes. It cannot deny. I was telling DADE I don't mean it.

195
00:21:25,98 --> 00:21:30,86
James he would know the people I mean

196
00:21:30,86 --> 00:21:38,66
and I have been around in that situation in connection with that line that always at the time he gave me the impression

197
00:21:38,66 --> 00:21:45,51
that he was a approachable about things like He's very shy as you know

198
00:21:45,51 --> 00:21:50,26
and very charming as far as meeting people on a personal scale is going to consent

199
00:21:50,26 --> 00:21:57,14
but I always felt that he really was prepared to stick around and be within the Herald in the editorial section

200
00:21:57,14 --> 00:22:00,67
or in the political I don't know that he is I think what.

201
00:22:01,3 --> 00:22:02,33
Not to shut you up

202
00:22:03,45 --> 00:22:10,91
or think what Susie's he's been doing since each of those which is not so he said as managing director is he's been

203
00:22:10,91 --> 00:22:16,52
busy moving the and apart from the fact that fortunately a number of people who were very much.

204
00:22:16,56 --> 00:22:23,12
The problem for the other indices for have got areas of all retarded in that period

205
00:22:23,12 --> 00:22:30,8
and he's deliberately been moving in much more liberal people I see Novick Carroll who's now the issues of X.

206
00:22:30,8 --> 00:22:34,22
Such as assume it's Ritchie for the whole group

207
00:22:34,22 --> 00:22:39,69
and he's been deliberately bringing in much more liberal they will see the whole paper has changed

208
00:22:39,69 --> 00:22:46,37
and I think he's going to be that way rather than what gets us out of the managing director and you'll do the.

209
00:22:46,49 --> 00:22:52,61
This is what I'm doing everything was right and they don't do that. I see it's feels like it means.

210
00:22:52,64 --> 00:22:58,24
Whereas I don't think James. I mean I don't know I didn't get a feel.

211
00:22:58,24 --> 00:23:04,17
I would ask those times will be most likely because most newspaper writers are on any issue very lies to move in

212
00:23:04,17 --> 00:23:10,00
and say this this and this must be written so you can try and put in people who they can trust

213
00:23:10,00 --> 00:23:14,67
and then give them that degree because that's the whole truth that they're all about

214
00:23:14,67 --> 00:23:21,93
and I think he's trying to do it that way so it probably get told to him a balanced

215
00:23:21,93 --> 00:23:29,46
but the upshot of that may be Carol you know it's good.

216
00:23:29,55 --> 00:23:36,25
Yes I see we're in a dead heat make that Carol connection and then ranking up to it

217
00:23:36,25 --> 00:23:41,81
and saying I was just speaking to all of me will be that I can go and talk to James and he

218
00:23:41,81 --> 00:23:49,54
and he would say you know I don't mind I'm going to go into town or why don't you go

219
00:23:49,54 --> 00:23:52,15
and talk to exude makes such will Carol.

220
00:23:52,28 --> 00:23:55,73
If he comes up on a mission of but I'm not going to go and

221
00:23:55,73 --> 00:23:59,97
or he probably would tell me how he's in the few months to do it.

222
00:23:59,99 --> 00:24:01,19
He knows another thing

223
00:24:01,19 --> 00:24:08,56
but he made the background sufficiently And have you gotten this Is there anything else you want to ask me on that

224
00:24:08,56 --> 00:24:13,65
because I'd like to ask you about the status of the because another of the knowledge here. Is there a bit.
