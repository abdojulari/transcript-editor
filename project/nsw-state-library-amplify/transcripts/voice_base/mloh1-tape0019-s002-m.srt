1
00:00:04,14 --> 00:00:11,09
Consequently all goods travelling by
who have been shipped by train had to

2
00:00:11,09 --> 00:00:16,01
be trained shipped at
all. Bris. Conversely.

3
00:00:17,78 --> 00:00:20,05
Goods fruit etc.

4
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:20,75
. Used to be

5
00:00:20,75 --> 00:00:26,43
a lot of bananas and pineapples and tropical
fruits coming down from queensland and

6
00:00:26,43 --> 00:00:31,99
northern new south wales going to be
toria they also had to be train ship.

7
00:00:33,65 --> 00:00:36,35
My was coming from or

8
00:00:36,35 --> 00:00:42,37
b most of them travelled by train in those
days and they also to be transit and

9
00:00:44,54 --> 00:00:46,24
. Work there was on

10
00:00:46,24 --> 00:00:53,03
a casual basis we used to have
to assemble on the railway

11
00:00:53,04 --> 00:00:59,87
platform in the early hours of the morning
in the winter the frost would be thicker

12
00:00:59,87 --> 00:01:06,37
on the ground and on the rails. And if you
were fortunate enough you'd get an hour

13
00:01:06,37 --> 00:01:12,37
or two's work at i think about one and ten
pounds per hour. At that time so they

14
00:01:12,37 --> 00:01:18,63
were really tough days but you
know we kept going and it was

15
00:01:18,63 --> 00:01:25,12
a good experience. In that way that it
tough and you were up to conditions and

16
00:01:25,88 --> 00:01:32,88
. Also formulated. A lot of ideas
about society in your mind.

17
00:01:33,66 --> 00:01:39,11
If you were going to be any work at
all that you did you lose you do.

18
00:01:40,53 --> 00:01:43,16
Well there was

19
00:01:43,16 --> 00:01:49,74
a limit. I think to which you
could. Go in earnings you

20
00:01:49,74 --> 00:01:53,98
step to make it. And when you presented
yourself for the dole you'd have to make

21
00:01:53,98 --> 00:01:56,70
a declaration or

22
00:01:56,70 --> 00:02:03,41
a statement as to whether you do and
any money through the week. But if the

23
00:02:03,41 --> 00:02:09,12
work was available casual work. Well we
would always prefer to have that then

24
00:02:11,13 --> 00:02:16,71
going down for the dole because as i told
you it was always at the police station.

25
00:02:16,73 --> 00:02:18,40
And you know it's

26
00:02:18,40 --> 00:02:22,87
a certain degree of indignity about lining
up to the local police station and the

27
00:02:22,87 --> 00:02:27,27
local policeman asking for dialogue if
we could do without it. If we could find

28
00:02:27,27 --> 00:02:31,34
jobs here for the harvesting was on
we'd go out into the bush and get

29
00:02:31,34 --> 00:02:38,27
a job. Then when things were really bad and
there was no work at all to be obtained

30
00:02:38,27 --> 00:02:45,26
the dole was the last resort for us. Do
you remember the activities of the dole

31
00:02:45,26 --> 00:02:51,96
inspectors. Well i do to some
extent but they were more

32
00:02:51,96 --> 00:02:57,57
active in the city than they
were in the in the country.

33
00:02:58,97 --> 00:03:03,74
I had no actual experience with them.
I've had reports of and they were

34
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,98
pretty tough prying intruding
sort of blokes that. Always

35
00:03:12,98 --> 00:03:19,19
seemed to have the ject eve of depriving
someone of the dole in his days. I didn't

36
00:03:19,19 --> 00:03:24,77
have an experience i was in the country
towns during all that time. When you get

37
00:03:24,77 --> 00:03:30,20
eunuchs working you trued.
Well it was some time later.

38
00:03:31,79 --> 00:03:37,27
I stopped in or read till about 1940.

39
00:03:38,76 --> 00:03:45,69
I came back to sydney at that time
and my first job back in the trade

40
00:03:45,69 --> 00:03:51,04
was in the randwick tramway
workshops where they'd

41
00:03:53,32 --> 00:03:59,10
convert at the shop to war production
and i start at there again as

42
00:03:59,10 --> 00:04:04,100
a boilermaker and we were making the
platforms for the eighteen pounders Â£18 guns

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,97
and that was my first experience back since
leaving the bridge. Thank you mr jones

44
00:04:10,97 --> 00:04:11,38
room.
