1
00:00:13,47 --> 00:00:17,95
I haven't been to women
that often recently. But.

2
00:00:17,97 --> 00:00:21,15
Like the kids that i grew up
with that are still there.

3
00:00:21,48 --> 00:00:26,96
You know i think it's lost a lot of magic
in the in it's still a very good far out

4
00:00:26,96 --> 00:00:28,78
place but just the period

5
00:00:28,78 --> 00:00:32,76
that we grew up just you know after queer
stress filled it was just something about

6
00:00:32,76 --> 00:00:38,40
it that just the era of kids and
adults that you know grew out of

7
00:00:38,40 --> 00:00:39,99
that experience is incredible

8
00:00:39,99 --> 00:00:45,85
and you know it's it's be hard to
reproduce you know i think just a one off

9
00:00:45,85 --> 00:00:55,33
incredible time.

10
00:00:56,32 --> 00:00:57,22
From.

11
00:00:59,98 --> 00:01:04,51
Well i've got some friends who live
in a community is still not in

12
00:01:04,51 --> 00:01:10,76
but nearby they come here they're doing
wonderful the same really good kids really

13
00:01:10,76 --> 00:01:16,59
close this some i mean of a few friends
they're getting they're still the drug

14
00:01:16,59 --> 00:01:21,78
scene of course one of the reasons. When
the change came to move to the beach.

15
00:01:21,81 --> 00:01:25,41
I'm glad that i kind of
moved from the image there.

16
00:01:25,50 --> 00:01:28,58
I mean you can't deny that
there is a drug scene in them

17
00:01:29,60 --> 00:01:31,70
but it was controlled around us as kids.

18
00:01:31,98 --> 00:01:33,34
It was never a problem at all

19
00:01:34,15 --> 00:01:38,86
but i mean few of my friends you know
sure they're into the drug scene a bit

20
00:01:38,86 --> 00:01:39,88
but i mean.

21
00:01:40,04 --> 00:01:41,89
But then there's the kids who aren't

22
00:01:41,89 --> 00:01:44,03
and they're doing wonderful
things who are still there.

23
00:01:44,16 --> 00:01:50,53
You know so i mix you know i think that.

24
00:01:50,54 --> 00:01:55,59
It is that even the
kids who have moved out

25
00:01:55,59 --> 00:01:59,55
and need to see mean spread
out. Everywhere really.

26
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:05,07
I have to say most really happy like.

27
00:02:05,09 --> 00:02:09,65
Really i mean i can say
to be one person one kid.

28
00:02:09,77 --> 00:02:13,99
So called he's probably not a kid
anymore but really one person he was

29
00:02:14,80 --> 00:02:17,01
and happy i mean i will
be absent there and.

30
00:02:17,62 --> 00:02:22,13
But yeah it was just i think it produced.

31
00:02:22,15 --> 00:02:27,23
A group of kids who are
growing up to be optimists.

32
00:02:27,26 --> 00:02:30,86
I mean you know bad things
happen and we get in bad need

33
00:02:30,86 --> 00:02:33,55
and we all think all the whole
world's going to former top of this

34
00:02:33,55 --> 00:02:36,99
but in comparison to when elsewhere.

35
00:02:37,45 --> 00:02:41,61
Most the time we can discuss how we can
handle this problem. You know it's.

36
00:02:41,63 --> 00:02:45,54
I know i mean it might just be me and i
might have you know there's always i will.

37
00:02:45,54 --> 00:02:49,38
I would have turned out the same anyway.
But i really don't think i would have.

38
00:02:49,86 --> 00:02:54,30
I just yeah it's like there's always
the branding i'll the hippie kids

39
00:02:54,30 --> 00:02:58,47
that grew up poor them you know. The
nat period their life was wasted.

40
00:02:58,51 --> 00:03:00,37
But i don't now they're
living in suburbia.

41
00:03:00,44 --> 00:03:04,82
Ok we can reform them where i think it's
the opposite. You know like you'll see.

42
00:03:04,94 --> 00:03:07,46
You can pick them out the kids
that grew up with that lifestyle

43
00:03:08,36 --> 00:03:10,53
and they're the real there's a
vibrant they're the leaders.

44
00:03:10,67 --> 00:03:15,61
You know that none of this or that a dud
ones are just in the corner smoking

45
00:03:15,61 --> 00:03:18,31
and stuff you know they're they're
really magic kids you know like.

46
00:03:18,91 --> 00:03:21,47
A lot of kids i know have
moved away from them

47
00:03:21,47 --> 00:03:27,05
and they're doing wonderful things in the
city like really outgoing leadership

48
00:03:27,05 --> 00:03:31,56
stuff you know academically
art everything you know

49
00:03:31,56 --> 00:03:35,07
and to whereas people saying oh you know
they grew up on a farm there you know

50
00:03:35,07 --> 00:03:36,05
parents were hippies

51
00:03:36,05 --> 00:03:39,84
and stuff you know they probably won't
make it as far as if they'd go up there.

52
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:40,69
I think it's the opposite.

53
00:03:41,14 --> 00:03:46,15
I think just the way we look at life
is totally different like just.

54
00:03:46,71 --> 00:03:51,40
Our upbringing has made us have a totally
different perspective of life which i

55
00:03:51,40 --> 00:03:52,32
think is really good

56
00:03:52,32 --> 00:03:58,00
and it's just benefiting me fully in high
school in everything around me. You know.

57
00:03:58,02 --> 00:04:02,80
It's really just in. Every i
run again and muses me no end.

58
00:04:03,15 --> 00:04:06,20
People say oh you know.

59
00:04:06,21 --> 00:04:09,90
Do you feel that those years were
wasted or you know people think that

60
00:04:09,90 --> 00:04:13,59
that was you know the poor hippy
kids what a waste. I mean.

61
00:04:15,12 --> 00:04:19,29
It really isn't really because i have
to say it's the total opposite they see

62
00:04:22,16 --> 00:04:25,48
it was just a she was so it's
hard to express i mean really.

63
00:04:25,69 --> 00:04:27,19
They were just totally amazing

64
00:04:27,19 --> 00:04:31,08
and it was like as anything now i'm wasting
my time getting in a chair say i should

65
00:04:31,08 --> 00:04:36,28
be out there doing it. I mean realistically
i don't know that's another story.

66
00:04:36,51 --> 00:04:41,37
But you know i'm doing what i'm doing and
i'm happy doing it. So that's fine but.

67
00:04:41,39 --> 00:04:47,40
I have to say that waste is
not even a word i mean it's.

68
00:04:47,42 --> 00:04:51,45
You couldn't even you couldn't even think
of saying oh yeah wasted years as a joke

69
00:04:51,45 --> 00:04:56,58
you know being sarcastic. If you just
couldn't really because it was just.

70
00:04:57,50 --> 00:05:01,96
Basically was just an amazing time
and living in it. We decide i am.

71
00:05:01,97 --> 00:05:05,28
This is really cool and haven't
heaps of fun but reflecting back on

72
00:05:05,28 --> 00:05:06,23
and i think it's just

73
00:05:06,23 --> 00:05:12,23
when you really get blase of a way i really
think because we've had so much fun as

74
00:05:12,23 --> 00:05:13,25
a kid i can't live our lives.

75
00:05:13,55 --> 00:05:16,48
So my free for you know they
said you know it's really now

76
00:05:16,48 --> 00:05:19,55
that you're hearing other kids
stories and their upbringing

77
00:05:20,30 --> 00:05:25,04
and realizing what how i was you
know that that an incomprehensibly

78
00:05:25,04 --> 00:05:26,31
that i was even applicable.

79
00:05:26,67 --> 00:05:31,05
I had a totally different lifestyle as
thank god i did you know it was wonderful.

80
00:05:31,22 --> 00:05:36,12
Like you know he kids how they grew up and
today dada. And you think how boring.

81
00:05:36,32 --> 00:05:38,75
You know you think wow i
just think when i was

82
00:05:38,75 --> 00:05:42,99
that age i was off camping i was of learning
how to make a boomerang as throw it.

83
00:05:42,99 --> 00:05:46,16
I was off our learn how to make our
own paper and things like that.

84
00:05:46,27 --> 00:05:50,95
You know you think that those kids they
don't have and they might not never have

85
00:05:51,73 --> 00:05:58,14
and it's like i'm just so thankful but
i'm also thankful in a way that the time

86
00:05:58,14 --> 00:05:59,87
that i spent nimbin was real.

87
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,60
Good but now then i'm out i'm glad

88
00:06:02,60 --> 00:06:08,41
that i'm like work i'm free to use the
knowledge that we've had since we're kids

89
00:06:08,41 --> 00:06:10,37
but go along in the lifestyle

90
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:14,80
that we are here away from nimbin
that's always a part of us you know.

91
00:06:14,82 --> 00:06:20,25
It's like i think if i still in nimbin now
you know i'd be totally different scene

92
00:06:20,25 --> 00:06:24,03
there might be you know i might be
doing wonderful things in nimbin

93
00:06:24,03 --> 00:06:25,82
but i also there's the drug side.

94
00:06:26,10 --> 00:06:30,29
You know as things on the time i
spent nimbin was just incredible

95
00:06:30,29 --> 00:06:36,56
and i'm really thankful that i grew up
there was this incredible experience.

96
00:06:38,68 --> 00:06:40,26
For.
