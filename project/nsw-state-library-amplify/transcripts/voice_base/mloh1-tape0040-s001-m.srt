36
00:03:56,06 --> 00:03:56,69

00:04:05,53 --> 00:04:10,56
and Berry Street_ Waddingtons and the projectionist was Sir R.

39
00:04:10,56 --> 00:04:19,79
I remember awesome me out the explorer and their what yields were we talking about on about nineteen hundred

40
00:04:19,79 --> 00:04:31,35
and the meal worked that out to about nineteen fifteen/ ninety fourteen projection Mosimann is those well really was

41
00:04:31,35 --> 00:04:37,46
all know I never saw saw them then that my mother told me that he was at one time up there earlier, police,

42
00:04:37,46 --> 00:04:40,28
there was another little picture theatre which no one remembers.

43
00:04:40,28 --> 00:04:48,06
I spoke no one living today ever feel right now that the military post office called the Empire picture theatre,

44
00:04:48,06 --> 00:04:53,08
which is a little tin shed and I remember going to my father when I check in hand,

45
00:04:53,08 --> 00:05:03,59
watching the pictures are with terminal via Murano are no know there was in the Orpheum round those days at the first

46
00:05:03,59 --> 00:05:09,36
Orpheum was down opposite where the bridge comes out now in no logical Junction Street,

47
00:05:09,36 --> 00:05:14,32
and that was started by some people by the name of the Governor,

48
00:05:14,32 --> 00:05:23,17
who had a fruit shop up in North Sydney Mount Street and at the first or free and it was originally at ten shared,

49
00:05:23,17 --> 00:05:32,18
but then are rebuilt again in later years to more or less a modern one and you could see the richer are from

50
00:05:32,18 --> 00:05:35,3
when it was a modern one known later on,

51
00:05:35,3 --> 00:05:42,45
when looking down from the roof of the template you know Mal Wellington turned it down because on the same level,

52
00:05:42,45 --> 00:05:48,66
but it said work going on from their super tram didn't go by AMP rocket Jamil.

53
00:05:48,66 --> 00:05:56,09
What error of the First World War, well very little very little in they because our dome ear is warrior oh one

54
00:05:56,09 --> 00:05:59,19
and oh seven nine hundred and fourteen night I didn't.

55
00:05:59,19 --> 00:06:05,01
I can remember this, but the people now in amber sendoffs and we are to go down the waterfront

56
00:06:05,01 --> 00:06:07,95
and just watch the year trip ships go out

57
00:06:07,95 --> 00:06:17,84
and the people waving waving the in a letter to attract their men friend elderly relatives with a big sheet to

58
00:06:17,84 --> 00:06:20,33
something so they could be seen and not a little flag

59
00:06:20,33 --> 00:06:24,88
but something I can remember that another member on the return home in our street.

60
00:06:24,88 --> 00:06:31,15
The couple of the people came back and then there they welcome home signs of put on the houses

61
00:06:31,15 --> 00:06:37,8
and the party that regular motors have a fortunate comeback at a cost of only seven years of age at the time

62
00:06:37,8 --> 00:06:43,77
but taken them well on them in the left over from the party all the kids on the street would be given the left over the

63
00:06:43,77 --> 00:06:51,17
next eight what you remember every year of your father well remember him.

64
00:06:51,17 --> 00:06:58,00
He is he was English laundromat there many year ago. I understand that term was a London police force.

65
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:01,34
I think it was the black sheep of the family from what they can gallop

66
00:07:01,34 --> 00:07:06,35
and that he finally become basin securely mounted a text on the wall.

67
00:07:06,35 --> 00:07:11,79
The CO2 effects are much so he got to know a very famous old Prime Minister Australia.

Emma told that term average Billy Hughes and the he call my father Ben and my father called him Billy,

70
00:07:20,34 --> 00:07:23,68

00:07:33,24 --> 00:07:35,54
noted, I was in Exeter time I learn each year,

73
00:07:35,54 --> 00:07:42,74
but I think he told mum affair little stories that she could relate to seek to be some little mystery there that he

74
00:07:42,74 --> 00:07:51,11
overheard something and but today is pretty sick about those things are and what would we develop working.

75
00:07:51,11 --> 00:07:57,19
He was working on the walls of the security as security years and your mother body of her Byron

76
00:07:57,19 --> 00:07:59,41

and if seventy I to the five years I shows Q R I looked after in later life. Yes much electoral.

78
00:08:06,85 --> 00:08:12,58

which is well known

81
00:08:21,51 --> 00:08:27,54
and it's on the back fence on the back of the agenda LeMay challenging your people personally on the back of that

82
00:08:27,54 --> 00:08:32,98
and she still looked wonderful stories of those people who can you relate any of a story.

83
00:08:32,98 --> 00:08:39,35
Yes, I can relate one of them. One of the sad day when I got it under a magnifying classical are small.

You know, and when early days we were kids, Ghana, her Christmas holiday from school.

105
00:10:39,75 --> 00:10:48,47
when I realise now that building about her chappie, which is bad. Of course, now Jerry is very now. Now they never use.

106
00:10:48,47 --> 00:10:54,45
First, no matter how they might hear some mine, but I remember going to an old country dance ones,

107
00:10:54,45 --> 00:10:56,36

144
00:14:36,22 --> 00:14:39,94
I do not know that the real problem but

145
00:14:39,94 --> 00:14:44,96
but these are a funeral had the money which wasn't I spoke to sound a lot these days, but

146
00:14:44,96 --> 00:14:49,73
when I see the price of meat pianos and player pianos, the ours was worth a read.

147
00:14:50,04 --> 00:14:54,02
Call the PMO are the others player pianos that is a difference.

148
00:14:54,02 --> 00:15:01,02
I sounds a bit high for less money, but that we are those open over at stray name penile it was out the first,

149
00:15:01,02 --> 00:15:05,49

153
00:15:23,73 --> 00:15:30,95
I done everything roundabout the place and you are later offer are laid off less clear, well, things are not bad.

154
00:15:30,95 --> 00:15:38,66
I sell my are with another chappie but then it's folded up the piano you got jobs local jobs found the place

155
00:15:38,66 --> 00:15:47,61

203
00:20:22,77 --> 00:20:27,07
and eyes are standard in the dangerous jobs which are others would deal with.

204
00:20:27,07 --> 00:20:35,63
I enjoyed very much indeed at reserve the present great experience for cinema bosses killed on the breeds

205
00:20:35,63 --> 00:20:38,17
and there was that an average Campbell.

208
00:20:52,02 --> 00:21:01,44
and that he was a marble only went down to do especially jobless down some attempting girders Amber this serve little

tripod that Jewish help Malouf now media drop in cattle for the stuff from our other East rattled down that kicked out.

210
00:21:09,25 --> 00:21:16,18
Then he went right from the top down, hit being light stanchion to the sleepers of the rail lines

211
00:21:16,18 --> 00:21:22,17
and finish up in the middle of the year pile on.

I could go and the shirt off trickle about Janelle come choice about his funeral.

00:21:37,49 --> 00:21:43,29
that I would like to assure you well as I was not that a further serious

00:22:05,4 --> 00:22:11,68
I hear someone makes a cry from colonialism less bloody day and that should assure shift,

220
00:22:11,68 --> 00:22:17,45
but she has brought out their main classes was available. They must up the crows nest.

221
00:22:17,45 --> 00:22:26,79
They match up to craziness and down, then. Cars up and down from the cars we went up in the current course.

when we got up to the cemetery added before the chairman tournament belt had been buried.

They all need to forget that cars all jumped out how they ran like madly fat what's going on here when I got there,

226
00:22:54,19 --> 00:22:56,11
there was little toilet block.

227
00:22:56,11 --> 00:23:00,6
Well, I suppose, by the timing of their there was enough round for Lumley, so they all went down

228

231
00:23:23,71 --> 00:23:31,73
and all these fellas still half drunk some of them in one fell over a year has some went on,

232
00:23:31,73 --> 00:23:34,06
he went to light a cigarette.

This is true what I'm just now and I, if only good record on camera in later life,

234
00:23:39,03 --> 00:23:45,14
and this telephone the other side to this end, but it end up doing mouth

235
00:23:45,14 --> 00:23:50,49
and the other fella must say to not describe because several deftly out

236
00:23:50,49 --> 00:23:53,81
or at that stage that we sought is asking for a cigarette,

237
00:23:53,81 --> 00:23:59,82
so we take his back cigarettes Jack's older grey biology to the other fella who could come and

238
00:24:00,43 --> 00:24:05,21
or is nearly collapsed they could not believe what could happen well.

239
00:24:05,21 --> 00:24:13,88
Anyway, that rewrite the Melbourne overall abortion via the big shots your bedroom barrel at the funeral course

It has been lowered so gems nearest friend and a kind of thing 's name: think his name is Carl anyway,

243
00:24:41,35 --> 00:24:44,8

244
00:24:44,8 --> 00:24:52,66
He picks up a bit of a clay to them in the risk in respect to know he got a bit cautious that had to cough anoint

245
00:24:52,66 --> 00:24:59,29
bulbul well at all these rough are many good time that they are all sincere they thought this is part

246
00:24:59,29 --> 00:25:02,64
and parcel of the main relate all picked up a better clay

247
00:25:02,64 --> 00:25:11,41
and near with as/ four hundred being allowed in with a one-month bank bank closer worse of claim are coming from

248
00:25:11,41 --> 00:25:20,98
everywhere. Similarly, could contest to. I'm not tell hello I I saw it and if I only record it F. C.

Jim is feasible and he would have loved to have seen it because it's a type of for me was that he would have a laugh,

250
00:25:27,7 --> 00:25:33,37
a would of had last hasn't been let down, it was a looked up if they have a glass further top of the coffin.

00:25:37,29 --> 00:25:42,65
You remember Pope 's being murdered people only and no, I don't remember when exactly,

253
00:25:42,65 --> 00:25:44,55
but I understand later on that

254
00:25:44,55 --> 00:25:51,68
and the plight are the pipes played the on the way after crazed scientist can't recall the pipes,

255

00:26:08,68 --> 00:26:12,75
He was one that was laying the final master is about.

258
00:26:12,75 --> 00:26:18,31
I remember one occasion on the beach where a cooler size young and eating beef.

He cannot BT baptised always keen on the condition

260
00:26:22,35 --> 00:26:27,98
and by the analyst also took on roundup in yet another bitter rational.

261
00:26:27,98 --> 00:26:40,1
In my younger days in diameter wrestling and the my Little form nowhere to go round with the year he was threatened,

262
00:26:40,1 --> 00:26:41,61

00:26:55,16 --> 00:27:04,84
You are known only to gamble no another sub is be your only was an offside at a gym and that if England are in panic

266
00:27:04,84 --> 00:27:11,08
and not, as measured by the yet and is marketed at a walk round with me. I thought it was. I have nothing happening.

269
00:27:25,07 --> 00:27:29,65
when everything killed off and owes a minder to the famous Don Bradman,

270
00:27:29,65 --> 00:27:32,26

273
00:27:43,94 --> 00:27:48,12
I suspect some of your body said we got Don Bradman play with us and look,

274
00:27:48,12 --> 00:27:56,43
here's where it is claimed he can never get down to the treaty because he was God naturally never anyone tried a pat on

275
00:27:56,43 --> 00:27:58,99
the back, get their autograph and he could walk to the wicket.

276
00:27:58,99 --> 00:28:07,66
No coming back to I stand by nine I was just the way to have those days, not these data bases aid so only love them.

277
00:28:07,66 --> 00:28:11,61
I had to set by him when he walked down to the year gate.

278
00:28:11,61 --> 00:28:17,32
I let him in and the push of men, women and children out of the way and
