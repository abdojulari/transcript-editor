1
00:00:19,34 --> 00:00:27,3
Identification. This is Station three and it's the second side of tape three.

2
00:00:27,32 --> 00:00:50,08
And if you became a few seconds and got it. What happened after better just.

3
00:00:51,06 --> 00:00:59,1
I was a better story for quite a long time. Brings back beautiful memories because the locals were so good.

4
00:00:59,48 --> 00:01:12,19
They were wonderful to us and on Sunday afternoon. They'd fight between themselves to have us for. Scums cream and tea.

5
00:01:13,76 --> 00:01:20,71
So I left with a little regret I have to say I found it very difficult least because so because it was so beautiful.

6
00:01:22,08 --> 00:01:29,68
And one thing I want to say about that castle one of them some local family had an eighty two grand piano for the uses

7
00:01:29,68 --> 00:01:37,46
for the girls to use. And the coach was a very good pianist. But she could also play J.S.

8
00:01:37,46 --> 00:01:48,49
So at the end of the day and a half to dinner at night we'd dance feet of each other in the ballroom.

9
00:01:48,51 --> 00:02:02,08
So then I came back to Sydney and had some leave but I want to tell you. About being at the irrigation here.

10
00:02:03,66 --> 00:02:11,42
And I don't really ever learnt about the irrigation area when I was at school and how the canals were built

11
00:02:12,2 --> 00:02:21,66
and opened every so often. And these great massive orchards. Fruit watered.

12
00:02:23,17 --> 00:02:31,22
And I often thought that if they could do that in that raid. On the irrigation area.

13
00:02:31,95 --> 00:02:44,15
They could have done it in the center of Australia I suppose. But anyhow. I wanted to pertain to pick grapes. And.

14
00:02:44,17 --> 00:02:54,29
Griffith. And we were OK I'm to a huge old Costello right in the heart of the town really.

15
00:02:54,62 --> 00:03:05,84
And it took two hundred women. And my first job of course or most of us were all working picking grapes.

16
00:03:05,86 --> 00:03:10,73
And the grapes would go to the William winery or was it painful.

17
00:03:10,75 --> 00:03:16,95
But Williams I think well of course you had all of these young sophisticated women.

18
00:03:17,22 --> 00:03:24,27
Picking grapes and there at the end of the day he having a little drink at the winery.

19
00:03:25,8 --> 00:03:28,55
And the bosses would always say have one for the road.

20
00:03:28,59 --> 00:03:43,18
You know don't have one for the road and sometimes turn up the choir I believe in kept. So I enjoyed working there.

21
00:03:43,19 --> 00:03:52,31
There was one particular Italian family. Which employed quite a number of girls and they had a son.

22
00:03:54,04 --> 00:04:01,67
I can't remember his name but he came knocking on the door the door in a farmhouse came to us

23
00:04:01,67 --> 00:04:05,19
and he came knocking on the door. One Saturday afternoon.

24
00:04:05,2 --> 00:04:10,01
And I asked the officer in charge if he could see me and she said Oh yes I suppose.

25
00:04:10,63 --> 00:04:15,14
You know I think they're pretty easy. By then. Incidentally we were in uniform.

26
00:04:15,14 --> 00:04:23,11
We had for her a year or eighteen months by. And in uniform. But anyhow this young man had some books.

27
00:04:23,12 --> 00:04:25,53
And he said Faith.

28
00:04:26,09 --> 00:04:28,19
I thought you might like to borrow some of my books

29
00:04:28,19 --> 00:04:32,41
and I said I'd love to because there was never anything to read around the place

30
00:04:32,41 --> 00:04:36,89
and we wouldn't even newspapers we couldn't get the Herald anything like that

31
00:04:36,89 --> 00:04:42,5
and we both very dependent on radio while us as we called it

32
00:04:42,5 --> 00:04:52,5
and we had this little while as we'd all flock around to hear the news. Well I rather work men bringing me to.

33
00:04:53,17 --> 00:05:04,91
Good looking guy. Books to read for a few days past and I thought I'd better have a look at them and one was.

34
00:05:04,93 --> 00:05:14,72
The origin angles origin of the family and the other was Mark's hand to poke on capital.

35
00:05:15,84 --> 00:05:25,64
And I got stuck into things and I thought oh yeah I reckon there's something good in it. Anyhow.

36
00:05:26,82 --> 00:05:33,73
You know why it was regretful but do you know why it was goaded I began the interview with.

37
00:05:34,92 --> 00:05:36,94
A lot of do a lot of singing.

38
00:05:38,26 --> 00:05:49,64
And I was doing a lot of practice with the local who would take me and the music you know they were very good.

39
00:05:49,66 --> 00:05:55,59
This was while you were in the land me. Oh yeah sure. Griffith and Laden. Yes.

40
00:05:55,97 --> 00:06:12,39
And I also did a couple of terms of piano. And shorthand. So when I was able to do that you know in the Land Army.

41
00:06:12,9 --> 00:06:17,77
But the demand for me to sing quite considerable that.

42
00:06:17,95 --> 00:06:23,5
Been singing like you know having lessons for quite some years and.

43
00:06:23,52 --> 00:06:24,82
And I rather enjoyed this

44
00:06:24,82 --> 00:06:32,73
but usually I would be asked to sing by the farmers near the family were mainly Welsh for the morrow.

45
00:06:33,39 --> 00:06:38,33
They were very big. And they were the kindest people ever.

46
00:06:38,57 --> 00:06:44,75
They'd sing of course in Welsh what language the world doesn't matter. They sing it. Well.

47
00:06:45,06 --> 00:06:51,32
And I had a choir that move would move around from place to place and I'd go to church

48
00:06:51,32 --> 00:06:55,31
and had a wonderful choir in the local church one of the local churches.

49
00:06:55,54 --> 00:07:00,74
So I got involved with this lot and it was wonderful. I'd sing when I get married.

50
00:07:01,05 --> 00:07:12,76
I would sing when I sing in the churches. And then one night I was singing at one of the local churches in little.

51
00:07:12,99 --> 00:07:20,21
And a man in the. Soldier's uniform came up to me afterwards.

52
00:07:20,23 --> 00:07:25,82
And he said I'm on leave at present and visiting friends here but would you come over

53
00:07:25,82 --> 00:07:28,88
and sing to the boys over at Kapooka.

54
00:07:28,9 --> 00:07:40,09
And I said What is Kapooka army came past side of Warga Oh I couldn't think of anything better. So I said.

55
00:07:42,45 --> 00:07:48,81
In a few weeks a few weeks after that I asked the officer if I could have leave to go over because I had this

56
00:07:48,81 --> 00:07:55,81
invitation to go over to work. And she said Now you know that you're working on Sundays now to get the apricot.

57
00:07:55,83 --> 00:08:04,93
And afraid not. Well I want to have you. Together with two others and and they were so desperate for us.

58
00:08:04,94 --> 00:08:09,88
They wouldn't punish us you see because they needed us on the field. You know to pick.

59
00:08:09,99 --> 00:08:17,14
So we knew we could get away with it. So three of us set off. And we got the train from little to do you need.

60
00:08:18,75 --> 00:08:25,75
And at uni. The blokes came and met us in an Army truck. And said they said hello.

61
00:08:25,91 --> 00:08:33,79
We're not supposed to be meeting you in an Army truck because you've got. Do you mind if we throw this rug.

62
00:08:34,01 --> 00:08:44,6
When we go through the gate to the camp. So you don't mind. So they took it to the hotel booked us into things.

63
00:08:44,74 --> 00:08:52,52
And they were looking after the camp at Kapooka and to get through the gate. The guards would have a look.

64
00:08:53,46 --> 00:09:02,64
Not where all. And so they mainly through the. Big Army top pole and so for us in the back and.

65
00:09:02,66 --> 00:09:13,69
So we went into the camp. One they prepared a feast for us they had a captain who was a very good.

66
00:09:16,47 --> 00:09:23,94
Element until I was hoarse and I kept.

67
00:09:23,95 --> 00:09:32,51
And I got them singing with me and they cry just saying and every time we were with Home Sweet Home

68
00:09:32,51 --> 00:09:39,00
and the tears would fall. And there was great sorrow the joy.

69
00:09:41,01 --> 00:09:49,32
You wouldn't sing a little bit before you sang that night that completely completely you know what you don't know if

70
00:09:49,32 --> 00:10:01,77
that but and so there was a man they had the name. Norton who are so nervous. And. Rather liked him.

71
00:10:02,6 --> 00:10:07,53
So of very rich romance developed and this went on for quite some time.

72
00:10:07,72 --> 00:10:17,56
So I kept going and he come over and it was absolutely wonderful and I take my mates. And I cook wonderful meals and.

73
00:10:19,39 --> 00:10:30,92
It was great. So anyhow. I mentioned that man's name because I will deal with him in some detail in the book.

74
00:10:30,94 --> 00:10:40,19
And not to forget. Mind you doesn't let me forget because when I was actually doing some work in commission in Sydney.

75
00:10:41,16 --> 00:10:53,19
After forty years he popped up. As a habitat planning for. But that's another story. And that's something into that.

76
00:10:54,18 --> 00:10:56,39
Did this singing.

77
00:10:56,41 --> 00:11:06,56
You did you did you ever consider it as a career you obviously love performing I had no ambitions whatsoever none

78
00:11:06,57 --> 00:11:11,26
whatsoever. But this person Norton.

79
00:11:11,66 --> 00:11:18,7
Had access to the office mates which was in the big I think Commercial Hotel in Walker.

80
00:11:19,28 --> 00:11:29,37
And everything was just laid on this. So he would take me there. With his captain. And I had a piano.

81
00:11:29,39 --> 00:11:44,62
And I'd sing for the blokes and one thing. Someone said look at them. We will talk to the friend and.

82
00:11:44,64 --> 00:11:56,91
Hundreds of people below. I want to move her and they started making their requests and they were calling out singing.

83
00:11:57,66 --> 00:12:11,14
And I stood on the veranda and I sing to them. And I sing to please sing some. They were shouting.

84
00:12:11,16 --> 00:12:16,46
And I just stood there and saying to them. And they were throwing flowers up onto the.

85
00:12:18,04 --> 00:12:20,74
And I believe they are practically the whole evening.

86
00:12:21,33 --> 00:12:28,59
And what it's like in country towns news passes around you see I've not been singing to the Blacks in.

87
00:12:29,82 --> 00:12:42,7
In they miss in walking around you had a reputation. I had a reputation. I did indeed.

88
00:12:42,71 --> 00:12:56,74
But they will because I left working out in the open. And the air would be Chris. And I would sing all day in the tree.

89
00:12:57,98 --> 00:13:05,2
Whatever it was. It makes me think in fact if your father and mother will.

90
00:13:05,97 --> 00:13:08,62
Your mother at any rate who sang around the house all day.

91
00:13:09,85 --> 00:13:13,09
I sang around the house are saying around the camp all day

92
00:13:13,86 --> 00:13:23,55
or wherever I was I had great friends in the in the women were some women are just so beautiful and lovely and kind.

93
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:33,09
And yeah I'd sing all day when I was working out in the fields and. Help to make the day go by.

94
00:13:33,26 --> 00:13:44,75
But it wasn't you know it wasn't all that you're waiting carrot very backbreaking. And we'd be given a carrot.

95
00:13:44,77 --> 00:13:57,64
For two months or three months just carrots backbreaking and you know it was eighty and ninety.

96
00:13:57,66 --> 00:14:15,75
So I wanted it if it's still in my very first experience of singing around the place. But if the.
