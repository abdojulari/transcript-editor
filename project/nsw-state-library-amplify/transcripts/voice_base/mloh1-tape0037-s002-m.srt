1
00:00:02,16 --> 00:00:08,38
And no way is you can say you remember

2
00:00:09,27 --> 00:00:16,23
. Roger butler and i was obvious to china
from john saw him on the doors point.

3
00:00:16,64 --> 00:00:22,81
And this newspaper photographer
timeline took our photograph

4
00:00:22,81 --> 00:00:24,77
horrify the next day to save

5
00:00:24,77 --> 00:00:30,64
a fight. But this was very early in
the piece i think it was right at the

6
00:00:31,68 --> 00:00:35,95
sun. I mean the contract right at the end
of those point do you remember any of the

7
00:00:35,95 --> 00:00:40,80
other to remember the public works for
toggle for a very well very well he was

8
00:00:40,80 --> 00:00:46,03
a friend of mine and when
he was commissioned to

9
00:00:48,01 --> 00:00:51,97
prepare their stock photographic documentary
evidence of the building at the bridge

10
00:00:51,97 --> 00:00:57,32
. It just for him to walk all over the job
of going to different places here and

11
00:00:57,32 --> 00:01:01,54
there when i had the job of going with him
because of the job needed and so was he

12
00:01:02,64 --> 00:01:08,64
the bob that's right. Band members
assistant brindle which is

13
00:01:08,64 --> 00:01:14,19
a bill brindle. He left during the during
the building of the bridge and went to

14
00:01:14,19 --> 00:01:20,01
work for the newspapers. I have probably
better him but i also got to know after

15
00:01:20,01 --> 00:01:25,61
they are left he got he had an assistant
who took over and i used to go with him he

16
00:01:25,61 --> 00:01:27,03
could have been starting

17
00:01:27,03 --> 00:01:33,24
a flood or something like that. No
hard it can't be sure. You know

18
00:01:33,24 --> 00:01:35,55
we did you ever there was

19
00:01:35,55 --> 00:01:42,03
a photograph taken of the placing of the
last stone in the pylon on the bridge

20
00:01:42,76 --> 00:01:46,87
. And there's a photographer there and
his photographer is out on the end of

21
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:47,56
a good or

22
00:01:47,56 --> 00:01:53,12
a piece of. And he's taking the photo this
photograph of this and i. There was one

23
00:01:53,12 --> 00:01:57,75
copy of the photograph of the photographer
taking the photograph which i have i was

24
00:01:57,75 --> 00:02:02,25
wondering who he was because he's right
in the middle. You know over space. Well

25
00:02:02,25 --> 00:02:07,74
this is how he used to do this sort of thing
is to go the most amazing places. And

26
00:02:07,75 --> 00:02:12,36
if i if i make

27
00:02:12,36 --> 00:02:16,15
a guess i'd say it would be bound because
he'd be about the only bloke i know i do

28
00:02:16,15 --> 00:02:23,04
think to you. Particular remember
robert byrd and yes he. Well i was

29
00:02:23,04 --> 00:02:28,53
asked to go with him when he was taking
photographs showing all around and if you'd

30
00:02:28,53 --> 00:02:32,68
ever question first who he was there was
somebody there to vouch for him but i

31
00:02:32,68 --> 00:02:38,20
recall that. I want to kasian that he wanted
to take some pictures of the building

32
00:02:38,20 --> 00:02:44,49
of the southern approach where and he
decided to go up on top chimney at the

33
00:02:44,49 --> 00:02:50,97
royal the mining these in there and i found
his way up and took pictures from the

34
00:02:50,97 --> 00:02:53,58
top of it which is about as

35
00:02:53,58 --> 00:02:59,99
a long way to go. And you never went up
there with nothing to do after the fact

36
00:02:59,99 --> 00:03:04,91
that the one you were was did you see any
other photographers wandering around did

37
00:03:04,91 --> 00:03:11,53
you ever see only mallard no i don't recall
seeing any of. I think bradfield had

38
00:03:11,53 --> 00:03:13,05
arranged with him to take

39
00:03:13,05 --> 00:03:18,64
a photograph movie photograph for the
institution of engineers. Well i wouldn't be

40
00:03:18,64 --> 00:03:24,13
where i would know it at
all. Put there was somebody

41
00:03:26,05 --> 00:03:32,48
recollection now who is either associated
with the north sydney north shore

42
00:03:33,37 --> 00:03:38,83
grammar school and he used to take
pictures from the grammar school of the

43
00:03:41,41 --> 00:03:46,09
progress of the bridge and don't want to
kasian he distinguished himself by taking

44
00:03:46,09 --> 00:03:50,07
photographs during a fog sydney
harbour when the bridge was

45
00:03:50,07 --> 00:03:55,56
a merging from the fog lie and you could
see the you could see the two creeper

46
00:03:55,56 --> 00:04:00,83
crimes in the top sections of each
side of the arch. But i remember

47
00:04:00,83 --> 00:04:05,53
a photograph like that taken by frank
cash the. That's the name of the chap you

48
00:04:05,53 --> 00:04:07,52
spoke. He was the clergyman at

49
00:04:07,52 --> 00:04:14,40
a christchurch and i said that's
right. Well after that reminds me

50
00:04:14,40 --> 00:04:19,37
but couldn't recall is nine. Do you ever
meet him. Frank cash. No not that i can to

51
00:04:19,37 --> 00:04:22,85
go. Do you. You did quite

52
00:04:22,85 --> 00:04:28,01
a lot of work other than for the bridge
for bradfield didn't you. Yes but not

53
00:04:28,01 --> 00:04:34,95
during office hours. But this was done
mostly in the evening when i had an

54
00:04:34,95 --> 00:04:38,67
office or a room with jason
to his office and by

55
00:04:38,67 --> 00:04:45,50
a mutual understanding because
he explained before things

56
00:04:45,51 --> 00:04:52,27
the idea settle down into. And to

57
00:04:52,27 --> 00:04:58,10
establish that he couldn't
pay me. So perhaps

58
00:04:59,19 --> 00:05:05,92
in some ways reagan. He can give
something back or in some return.

59
00:05:06,22 --> 00:05:12,37
We want to go to dinner and much
more hotel but which is close handy.

60
00:05:12,80 --> 00:05:19,77
And many and many occasions.
We would go up there.

61
00:05:19,78 --> 00:05:26,61
Haven't we all. And then their return
to the office and perhaps leave leave

62
00:05:26,61 --> 00:05:32,57
the public works department say about half
past eight or nine o'clock at night and

63
00:05:32,58 --> 00:05:38,73
matter fact you see that picture up here.
For some reason rather he gave me that it

64
00:05:38,73 --> 00:05:42,32
was richer by colder. One
of the of the arches

65
00:05:42,32 --> 00:05:48,53
a desire not got the person design.
I think was had been painted by

66
00:05:49,36 --> 00:05:54,07
. I think it was possibly one of the staff
i'm not sure where i can't recall his

67
00:05:54,07 --> 00:05:59,55
name now. But that somehow
or other. Is it's

68
00:05:59,55 --> 00:06:02,97
a cult original in that. No it's
not original is a photograph

69
00:06:02,97 --> 00:06:06,91
a color photograph. Which
that's right. Called

70
00:06:06,91 --> 00:06:13,21
a color that. But that would
probably get that about

71
00:06:15,14 --> 00:06:20,80
you know i can't 1930 see that it is
that he said but he didn't confine his

72
00:06:20,80 --> 00:06:27,20
interests to near south wales. He
was also interested in queensland

73
00:06:27,93 --> 00:06:31,12
. The story bridge. And he is

74
00:06:31,12 --> 00:06:37,97
a state he was quite interested
only in the turning back the rivers

75
00:06:37,97 --> 00:06:44,65
in queensland to fly west for now regained
the western plains of new south wales.

76
00:06:44,67 --> 00:06:49,96
And south of us south us to queensland.
Did you work on any of the any of the

77
00:06:49,96 --> 00:06:55,45
drawings for him for that very likely
probably will probably be baps or some sort

78
00:06:55,45 --> 00:06:56,87
of. And that would be

79
00:06:56,87 --> 00:07:00,91
a 1933 to it. Well it would have been before
and you thirty to it it right because

80
00:07:00,91 --> 00:07:07,75
i just had together my nerves and. And
what about the story bridge did you

81
00:07:07,75 --> 00:07:09,40
complete help him with

82
00:07:09,40 --> 00:07:16,39
a preliminary drawings on that. Yes. There
is some designs that would many designs

83
00:07:16,39 --> 00:07:23,20
actually prepared but it was based on the
actual environment there and whether. I

84
00:07:23,20 --> 00:07:29,84
can't recall whether the final
design was very much like

85
00:07:31,94 --> 00:07:37,06
the earlier designs which we looked at and
then. And what would he. What would he

86
00:07:37,06 --> 00:07:41,87
do he say i want something like this. Will
you work work out what how did he get it

87
00:07:41,88 --> 00:07:46,55
. He can give you the general idea what he
what he's thinking and then hand it over

88
00:07:46,55 --> 00:07:51,62
here and you see what you come up with i
remember all that would different ideas

89
00:07:52,51 --> 00:07:56,69
and different methods of approach
on both sides which involve the

90
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:05,79
topography of the place but the
same thing happened to all the.

91
00:08:06,17 --> 00:08:13,14
The railway which is designed. Into the
northern suburbs of the coastal areas

92
00:08:13,14 --> 00:08:20,11
here. There were many poor taken
across middle harbour. At the spit

93
00:08:20,11 --> 00:08:23,49
bridge and preparation to
building a bridge across

94
00:08:23,49 --> 00:08:30,12
a little harbour. From sea fourth of
beautiful and somewhere over there. Did you

95
00:08:30,12 --> 00:08:34,39
control the positioning of
those poor boys. Well up to

96
00:08:34,39 --> 00:08:38,93
a point you probably suggest someone get
his agreement. And you go and do some

97
00:08:38,93 --> 00:08:44,53
surveying on it. Well only
mostly yes i did so i did level

98
00:08:45,51 --> 00:08:52,06
a level all the way from the oval to
manly and back but. But the plans were

99
00:08:52,07 --> 00:08:58,54
the route plans were trying to start
or drawing on the plans of the area

100
00:08:58,54 --> 00:09:05,24
official when. Did he give you anything to
do regarding you know i understand that

101
00:09:05,24 --> 00:09:09,56
when the wearing a railway was dropped as

102
00:09:09,56 --> 00:09:12,60
a project. He also proposed

103
00:09:12,60 --> 00:09:18,03
a worrying highway and i notice that this
paper's in the national library of her in

104
00:09:18,03 --> 00:09:21,04
her mongst his papers. Re wearing

105
00:09:21,05 --> 00:09:24,45
a roadway. Did you have to use do with it
though i'm less along you're speaking oh

106
00:09:24,45 --> 00:09:28,82
. Matter fact they even got so far as to
build some of it you know because the

107
00:09:28,82 --> 00:09:34,84
takeoff wish to avoid. All the northern
side of mawson is station from the existing

108
00:09:34,84 --> 00:09:40,76
tunnels and they turned away again
north side turned away to the right.

109
00:09:41,32 --> 00:09:45,19
Underground under the hill and
surfaced somewhere up near

110
00:09:45,19 --> 00:09:51,87
a neutral base of what i can recall the
two years ago for much. Now i see that

111
00:09:51,87 --> 00:09:58,12
no sydney uses them for no sydney university
use them for tagging bats too for

112
00:09:58,13 --> 00:10:04,85
tagging bats. Do they know i don't know
that last i heard they were going much yes

113
00:10:06,32 --> 00:10:10,56
but i was talking later on when the railway
was dropped the proposal was hit one of

114
00:10:10,56 --> 00:10:11,53
his proposals was for

115
00:10:11,53 --> 00:10:18,33
a roadway to wording. Now i don't doubt.
I don't recall anything else that.

116
00:10:20,41 --> 00:10:24,43
What about the low level bridge the design
of that did you see that over how did

117
00:10:24,43 --> 00:10:30,23
you have anything to do with it. Where
over middle harbour no bridges that i can

118
00:10:30,23 --> 00:10:36,62
recall high level bridges. With. I think

119
00:10:37,94 --> 00:10:44,53
the orion or i was at the lower
half of the bridge and the

120
00:10:44,53 --> 00:10:51,05
roadway was above on the top right on
the top. Is only actually seen one

121
00:10:51,05 --> 00:10:52,00
one was on

122
00:10:52,00 --> 00:10:55,96
a slide which was done of dr bradfield slide
which the department of main roads had

123
00:10:56,69 --> 00:11:01,05
which are now in the state archives.
It's a design for a bridge it's

124
00:11:01,05 --> 00:11:04,47
a fairly well it was to design is
actually one is a high level and one was

125
00:11:04,47 --> 00:11:09,33
a low level. No i don't remember anything
of the lower level of intelligence could

126
00:11:09,33 --> 00:11:13,20
have been done is the idea was that it would
be chill awful lot cheaper to make it

127
00:11:13,20 --> 00:11:17,82
a bit lower. You know and the query was
that what large shipping would need to go

128
00:11:17,82 --> 00:11:23,11
in middle harbour anyway. No you'd think
so there's not much out there now. Other

129
00:11:23,12 --> 00:11:29,88
ferries. Do you remember any other extraneous
work that you did for the documentary

130
00:11:29,88 --> 00:11:36,81
you know whenever.

131
00:11:36,82 --> 00:11:42,92
During the building of the bridge. Did you
ever go over the bridge looking at the

132
00:11:42,92 --> 00:11:49,42
work going on there is anything you remember
particularly. I had over many. But if

133
00:11:49,42 --> 00:11:49,70
you're in

134
00:11:49,70 --> 00:11:55,18
a hurry to get to know certainly prefer
to walk over the bridge. Rather than wait

135
00:11:55,18 --> 00:11:59,57
for the ferry and get across that i did you
walk over the arch at all. Oh yes many

136
00:11:59,57 --> 00:12:04,34
times i even went up on well it was just
you know all the answers met. I remember

137
00:12:04,34 --> 00:12:10,84
going to climbing up onto the end of the
creek. You know and taking photographs day

138
00:12:10,84 --> 00:12:14,100
out of the water and it was a whale of

139
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:21,73
a thousand to show the whale so under
the bridge. He still got their

140
00:12:21,73 --> 00:12:28,66
photograph. Oh possibly i've got
photograph here i haven't looked. Prius it

141
00:12:28,66 --> 00:12:33,25
could probably answer that is probably yes
it's you. The second person that's wrong

142
00:12:33,25 --> 00:12:35,36
about that while there
i met on one occasion

143
00:12:36,21 --> 00:12:39,61
a launch of stannard was taken out by
some photographers chasing it around the

144
00:12:39,61 --> 00:12:44,03
place and it came up under the under the
launcher. Now i don't know i think about

145
00:12:44,03 --> 00:12:46,50
it all this is one of the
fellows who was working as

146
00:12:46,50 --> 00:12:48,91
a holder up on the arts. He told

147
00:12:48,91 --> 00:12:55,24
a story. Now i don't know anything about
it but one thing and i don't know whether

148
00:12:55,24 --> 00:13:01,80
it's been mentioned at all but from
trucks and time. People visitors will be

149
00:13:02,54 --> 00:13:08,62
taken or asked to go over the arch one
side to the other. Well when you get up.

150
00:13:08,64 --> 00:13:14,42
It's not much to hang onto you know and
they lose their nerve. And they get to the

151
00:13:14,42 --> 00:13:21,39
stage where they were actually
physically helpless to accommodate by

152
00:13:21,40 --> 00:13:26,20
and take them down to the lower arch put
them down inside the lower arch and then

153
00:13:27,06 --> 00:13:33,79
get back to the back to the.
Down. All of the surface again

154
00:13:34,60 --> 00:13:38,89
by inside the arches themselves. I thought
that they didn't join up all the way

155
00:13:38,89 --> 00:13:42,34
through they did they could actually walk
right through and so much as you could

156
00:13:42,34 --> 00:13:47,69
walk right through. I said you could never
dropped off you could walk through it

157
00:13:47,69 --> 00:13:53,35
but i think i still recall photographs
of gordon stuckey when he was taking his

158
00:13:54,47 --> 00:13:59,73
check measurements with extra i think
they called extend someone xed so much as

159
00:14:00,45 --> 00:14:05,81
measuring the stresses in the in the members
themselves by the difference in length

160
00:14:06,61 --> 00:14:09,77
and i can well remember
seeing photos. I had some as

161
00:14:09,77 --> 00:14:11,95
a matter of fact but they were all with

162
00:14:11,95 --> 00:14:16,79
a national library people there. Yes i seen
the photographs of gordon stuck inside

163
00:14:16,79 --> 00:14:17,17
it was

164
00:14:17,17 --> 00:14:23,31
a one another engineer with him constant
kind of which when it was no i don't know

165
00:14:23,31 --> 00:14:28,21
who it would be i mean you weren't involved
in that at all. No no i was principally

166
00:14:29,94 --> 00:14:33,55
on both approaches in some detail and

167
00:14:37,45 --> 00:14:43,26
helping general to bradfield generally
on you know it alls usual things that i

168
00:14:44,55 --> 00:14:48,27
did when you were you said you were you
were up the top of the creeper crane when

169
00:14:48,27 --> 00:14:53,00
before the arches were joined tell me did
was there an impression of the two halves

170
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:57,35
swaying around at all. No i never felt
like i don't never up them very windy

171
00:14:57,35 --> 00:15:01,61
weather with that sort of thing i think
and as people reckon they used to sway

172
00:15:01,61 --> 00:15:08,33
slowly sometimes with the changes in
temperature at different. Yes that was. That

173
00:15:08,33 --> 00:15:14,60
was. In all in the actual joy of the two
arches you see they were both unsupported

174
00:15:14,60 --> 00:15:21,36
except right back up there that the
arch fins and get the conditions right.

175
00:15:21,54 --> 00:15:28,00
Did you have you been told about the holes
in. Oh i know you know all about it. So

176
00:15:28,00 --> 00:15:33,27
how they had to select the day when it was
the temperature was uniform the whole

177
00:15:33,27 --> 00:15:39,29
structure was the right temperature
before i can know when so they can make

178
00:15:39,29 --> 00:15:45,100
a drive the way just. And also to
determine to join it from my three

179
00:15:46,01 --> 00:15:46,74
hinged to

180
00:15:46,74 --> 00:15:50,57
a two hinged arch that was the day when
it had to be correct. Wasn't it. Yes yes

181
00:15:50,57 --> 00:15:56,93
that was right the upper section was
put in after the last two halves admit

182
00:15:58,09 --> 00:16:04,49
. Was there any other particular occasion.
Do you remember when are you. If you

183
00:16:04,49 --> 00:16:07,64
have the joining of the arch do you have
it. Were you up there that i wasn't there

184
00:16:07,64 --> 00:16:12,45
i member of the i knew it was happening.
What was going on and i don't purpose and

185
00:16:12,45 --> 00:16:19,20
maybe there were others then plenty
during the opening of the bridge. Oh yes.

186
00:16:19,22 --> 00:16:26,02
We were the right and i have an effect
on my mother and wife and i were there

187
00:16:27,31 --> 00:16:34,15
. I. With bill eyes had the
job of put in the river and

188
00:16:34,15 --> 00:16:35,86
position. There was

189
00:16:35,86 --> 00:16:42,53
a joke about this because it will be several
british reviews. One. I don't exactly

190
00:16:42,53 --> 00:16:46,32
would want to cite one in the
middle and some down the south and

191
00:16:51,81 --> 00:16:56,74
i well i. I brought them home. Here

192
00:16:58,89 --> 00:17:04,47
to someone not here now. It was for the
population of forget where i am and

193
00:17:06,20 --> 00:17:11,77
. Noticed they had been put together by
another wife of one of the other members of

194
00:17:11,77 --> 00:17:17,51
the staff and they had been
very closely say it onto

195
00:17:18,27 --> 00:17:24,76
a couple of sections of pipe. A copper
pipe about half an inch diameter

196
00:17:24,76 --> 00:17:31,36
outside diameter probably the stitching had
been paul very very tightly so that in

197
00:17:31,36 --> 00:17:36,76
the event we realized in the event of any
considerable for the stitching were just

198
00:17:36,76 --> 00:17:42,92
ripped and the rebels would fall off the
two fastenings and. This wasn't discovered

199
00:17:42,92 --> 00:17:49,56
until we got to work to put them out. I
thought gosh what if it blows hard during

200
00:17:49,57 --> 00:17:51,13
the morning and i start

201
00:17:51,13 --> 00:17:57,44
a flapper what'll happen is the stitching
or pull out and then and then the remoras

202
00:17:57,45 --> 00:18:02,70
will come adrift completely. So there's
nothing we could do. It had the timetable

203
00:18:02,70 --> 00:18:08,22
was fixed. You know as far as we were
concerned. So what was done was to put the

204
00:18:08,22 --> 00:18:15,03
remains that we hand in position at
the places there were one or two

205
00:18:15,03 --> 00:18:21,87
spare ribbons which anticipation
of trouble later on. Were down in

206
00:18:21,87 --> 00:18:28,60
the hole and. Down in the tollbooth.
We'd taken the precaution to

207
00:18:28,61 --> 00:18:35,44
have some what did what. What do you mean

208
00:18:35,44 --> 00:18:39,97
dissipation in some trouble later on. Do
you expect trouble. Yes yes it was well

209
00:18:39,97 --> 00:18:44,36
known going to be the chance i
would somebody or other this was

210
00:18:44,36 --> 00:18:48,100
a good deal of the new guard particularly
that was likely to create some difficulty

211
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,99
. So this has been far as we were
concerned we did what we could were i

212
00:18:55,99 --> 00:18:57,27
can explain to you. So

213
00:18:57,27 --> 00:19:04,09
a couple of things that howard.
Eventually yes indeed. But we had

214
00:19:04,09 --> 00:19:10,84
chaps. At the river. Whose job it was
once the agreement had been cut by when

215
00:19:10,84 --> 00:19:17,50
they had. To return with the reverends
that they were looking after there was no

216
00:19:17,50 --> 00:19:24,38
chance of anybody else so they were changing
and they had to bring all. The room in

217
00:19:24,38 --> 00:19:26,54
all the full length
back and we had that as

218
00:19:26,54 --> 00:19:32,83
a troll only well i however that
he got all he hasn't gone. And

219
00:19:35,11 --> 00:19:37,62
. We met

220
00:19:37,62 --> 00:19:44,53
a fact it was me who had the job
of designing the the first link

221
00:19:44,53 --> 00:19:45,62
which was was

222
00:19:46,37 --> 00:19:51,41
a reuse on the southern side of the
bridge just south of the tollgate. To

223
00:19:51,41 --> 00:19:57,84
accomodate their official
yes you know. The

224
00:19:57,85 --> 00:20:03,08
trestle was struggling or sitting it was
just immediately south of the bridge

225
00:20:03,08 --> 00:20:08,56
across there to be used by the premier
and in the opening of the bridge. I'm

226
00:20:08,56 --> 00:20:08,82
getting

227
00:20:08,82 --> 00:20:16,55
a bit wet like browsing.
And i was fortunate in

228
00:20:16,56 --> 00:20:23,46
being able to arrange quite good
seats for the opening my wife and my

229
00:20:23,46 --> 00:20:30,13
mother and i had the three top corner seats
overlooking the overlooking the british

230
00:20:30,13 --> 00:20:33,76
are the river in itself. And with

231
00:20:33,76 --> 00:20:39,54
a strict instruction that if anything
happened in the way of the british the river

232
00:20:39,54 --> 00:20:45,57
and being cut then hambone like and i were
to go down into the tol barad get the

233
00:20:45,57 --> 00:20:49,79
spare room and run it across in place
of the wonders why we now are just.

234
00:20:52,27 --> 00:20:59,09
While this was all going
on and. The guy who was

235
00:20:59,09 --> 00:21:04,20
you know to get to good. Whom
we saw and noticed. Was on

236
00:21:04,20 --> 00:21:11,03
a horse and one of the who was started
and this he and my wife knows

237
00:21:11,03 --> 00:21:14,63
about it more and i when
i do. He started to

238
00:21:18,16 --> 00:21:20,15
disturb his horse here and there's

239
00:21:20,15 --> 00:21:25,17
a horse champing around and we heard somebody
say in the name of something or other

240
00:21:25,17 --> 00:21:31,50
and good the group then with an upward
stroke cut. The room and he was

241
00:21:32,43 --> 00:21:38,26
quickly apprehended by policies of
detectives that were all over the place and

242
00:21:39,62 --> 00:21:40,53
carried he was only

243
00:21:40,53 --> 00:21:44,79
a little ma'am they got him under his arm
to his feet were about six inches off the

244
00:21:44,79 --> 00:21:50,44
ground and they carried him in the across
the roadway down into the tailgates and

245
00:21:50,44 --> 00:21:56,85
then from where behind us. And
or to somewhere were their own

246
00:21:57,68 --> 00:22:04,26
their own come presumably.
But another section.

247
00:22:04,28 --> 00:22:08,52
The electrical people had
also been asked to design

248
00:22:09,31 --> 00:22:14,15
a device. But in the event of
the river and having been cut.

249
00:22:15,79 --> 00:22:21,64
Nothing else would happen because associated
with the cutting of the bridge there

250
00:22:21,65 --> 00:22:26,100
were airplanes were to fly around to be

251
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:33,78
a procession over there were some pride
on the harbour or sort of it. Flags

252
00:22:33,78 --> 00:22:40,40
to fly under the actual cutting
operators all this once. So the

253
00:22:42,20 --> 00:22:46,41
chap. It was

254
00:22:46,41 --> 00:22:52,71
a row electrician who did the hadley hadley.
That's a do you know whether they had

255
00:22:52,71 --> 00:22:58,60
a minute walk down he was watching the river
and doing and he could only throw the

256
00:22:58,60 --> 00:23:00,70
final switch. I'm just

257
00:23:00,70 --> 00:23:07,03
a moment before the rules cut itself. Well
fortunately the device the precautions

258
00:23:07,03 --> 00:23:10,84
operated quite well. Nothing happened. So
what do you do then you go and get the

259
00:23:10,84 --> 00:23:15,46
other one. No we didn't know me there. So
well somebody else came up and joined it

260
00:23:15,46 --> 00:23:20,97
in the middle of the motive who are they
were i don't know that they were so yes

261
00:23:20,97 --> 00:23:23,91
berryman's weren't used. I got

262
00:23:23,91 --> 00:23:29,98
a bit. I showed you after this. But actually
what happened with the spirit was not

263
00:23:29,98 --> 00:23:34,83
a good deal demand for spare rooms and

264
00:23:36,46 --> 00:23:40,85
a few days later the river
and that were used to

265
00:23:40,85 --> 00:23:46,53
a cut in the links that also included
some of the spares and handed

266
00:23:46,53 --> 00:23:52,28
a most politicians and other other
prominent people who or i found i found

267
00:23:52,28 --> 00:23:56,81
a bit of myself for the other matter fact
i've probably got it out here and. Just

268
00:23:56,81 --> 00:23:57,85
so it probably was

269
00:23:57,85 --> 00:24:04,26
a nut revenues rich right across the whole
region. I don't think i don't think any

270
00:24:04,26 --> 00:24:11,07
of the review that we cut was on the bridge
at the time there. But. They wasn't the

271
00:24:11,07 --> 00:24:17,51
years. Yes there were stirring times what
happened to you then after the bridge.

272
00:24:17,58 --> 00:24:22,52
We were transferred from
my node and then. Oh

273
00:24:25,51 --> 00:24:26,53
i would say within a matter of

274
00:24:26,53 --> 00:24:31,59
a few months i was transferred to work on
the south western division straight to

275
00:24:31,59 --> 00:24:33,33
them for

276
00:24:33,34 --> 00:24:37,87
a number of years. Were you. Designing
bridges down there or what are you doing.

277
00:24:37,98 --> 00:24:44,84
Yes but not quite the same size it
is designing bridges there were

278
00:24:44,84 --> 00:24:51,21
prints of ridding out making standard
drawing fit into the enviro into the design

279
00:24:52,01 --> 00:24:55,98
now than the other way around. Do you
remember who standard drawings those were

280
00:24:57,08 --> 00:25:03,65
standard. They would be just departmental
departmental design department

281
00:25:03,65 --> 00:25:09,69
lead design bridges. Whether they
could they could be called green

282
00:25:10,64 --> 00:25:17,41
timber. Or. Just concrete. I suppose
we some steel registry would

283
00:25:17,41 --> 00:25:22,58
we didn't worry about new steel bridges
and so was division. I just happened to

284
00:25:22,58 --> 00:25:27,02
notice that looking through the department
of main roads standard design of the

285
00:25:27,02 --> 00:25:31,90
period that some were done by bradfield
and some were done by harvey day there.

286
00:25:34,53 --> 00:25:38,50
No. Well they were old ones anyway they
were mainly timber the ones i thought they

287
00:25:38,50 --> 00:25:43,21
would probably be all these old the old
standard public works department bridges

288
00:25:43,21 --> 00:25:50,09
which was the usual thing. Up until
advent of the vital moment you were

289
00:25:50,09 --> 00:25:54,88
there and bradfield went redesigned all
the standard designs at one stage in the

290
00:25:54,88 --> 00:25:58,38
proceedings to upgrade the ones. Well there
wasn't really upgrading what they were

291
00:25:58,38 --> 00:26:02,30
doing is likening the design previous to
that they had they had to use gigantic

292
00:26:02,30 --> 00:26:06,65
heavy timber and what they did was lighten
the design up to use smaller standard

293
00:26:06,65 --> 00:26:11,61
sizes of timber in well that might well
i think but i wouldn't be aware of that

294
00:26:11,61 --> 00:26:14,09
because i wasn't there and. I saw

295
00:26:14,09 --> 00:26:18,38
a standard design of bradfield as
well. Dated nineteen zero two. It was

296
00:26:18,38 --> 00:26:23,51
a small concrete ring all that
was probably was the real use

297
00:26:23,51 --> 00:26:29,26
a lot of they were made out of the money
of pipes. And with walls with we were also

298
00:26:29,26 --> 00:26:36,19
then. And you remained you remained
on the on the department main roads

299
00:26:36,19 --> 00:26:42,19
for many years did you. Oh no no no. Weather
department main road i i i was there

300
00:26:42,19 --> 00:26:46,81
six years but. I had

301
00:26:46,81 --> 00:26:50,63
a lot of things. Personally as wouldn't be

302
00:26:50,63 --> 00:26:54,45
a little bit of interest. Yeah. They were
very tough people who work very very

303
00:26:54,45 --> 00:27:01,29
tough and they were under the
control of rely very largely

304
00:27:01,29 --> 00:27:07,47
a lot of clique you know amongst the
engineers themselves and to be forced

305
00:27:08,33 --> 00:27:14,54
to join the department staff by methods
which i have already tell you about. It

306
00:27:14,55 --> 00:27:20,28
through us and into discard they were
not readily accepted. So all of you.

307
00:27:20,29 --> 00:27:22,05
Engineers that came in from the
railways were not accepted.

308
00:27:31,16 --> 00:27:32,91
I seem to recall that there was

309
00:27:32,91 --> 00:27:37,14
a possibility that some of the staff would
not be accepted by the bottom line or

310
00:27:37,14 --> 00:27:42,53
whether this was ever put into effect. I
don't know but you never sort of prospered

311
00:27:42,53 --> 00:27:47,26
in the department was that it. You know i
don't never possibly know i didn't like

312
00:27:47,26 --> 00:27:53,89
that until many engineers are maintained
and the questions of seniority. And and

313
00:27:53,90 --> 00:27:59,61
even there are there are their
appointment status on appointment was

314
00:28:01,67 --> 00:28:03,88
really in question times. It wasn't

315
00:28:03,88 --> 00:28:08,21
a very happy union it was no happy marriage
put it that way but it worked itself

316
00:28:08,21 --> 00:28:12,96
out largely by the staff who didn't like
the place getting out and you were one of

317
00:28:12,96 --> 00:28:19,53
them. Where did you go. I went i
went to the wrong road transport and

318
00:28:19,53 --> 00:28:26,06
family traffic and also on how
do you go there. I finished up

319
00:28:26,06 --> 00:28:32,81
a traffic engineer but. That was
after belies weld i was there.

320
00:28:33,33 --> 00:28:39,89
Chief there chief traffic engineer and i
followed his eyes but i that's where i

321
00:28:39,89 --> 00:28:46,79
retired. So they're resigned
