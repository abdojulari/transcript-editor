1
00:00:05,27 --> 00:00:06,64
They didn't start this is mr.

2
00:00:06,64 --> 00:00:08,64
Hugh dunn who worked as

3
00:00:08,64 --> 00:00:15,25
a riveter on the sydney harbour bridge for
dorman and long back in in the twenties

4
00:00:15,25 --> 00:00:20,19
when the bridge was being built. Will you
tell us about those times which today.

5
00:00:20,21 --> 00:00:24,16
What would you like you know what could
you tell us first about the process of

6
00:00:24,16 --> 00:00:30,60
riveting up on the arch. Well i'll
say this much. It was as good

7
00:00:30,60 --> 00:00:35,97
a job as is ever been on your wonderful
stagings were beautiful suited you lovely.

8
00:00:36,58 --> 00:00:41,56
And i was very happy. He was going to bridge
but that's one thing it struck me very

9
00:00:42,58 --> 00:00:48,06
polished think about it too was when i got
the job first. I got the squad together

10
00:00:48,06 --> 00:00:52,66
and the tools and by this
time the panel that was

11
00:00:52,66 --> 00:00:59,65
a six panels. And the go on

12
00:00:59,65 --> 00:01:02,06
the launch. That it is
actually what they call

13
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:08,57
a working punk kids come down and got
here in the cage. And that we went

14
00:01:09,80 --> 00:01:14,20
and as we went up and sydney ferries were
getting smaller and smaller and smaller

15
00:01:15,48 --> 00:01:19,79
and i thought crash i'm never going to stop.
But as soon as i stepped on the court

16
00:01:19,79 --> 00:01:24,61
. I lost my fear and that no more
fear from that day on it was

17
00:01:24,61 --> 00:01:29,45
a really terrific job. My
hold up the fellow was

18
00:01:29,45 --> 00:01:33,97
a hold up. When there was another
piece of the bridge. Coming up.

19
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:38,18
Like

20
00:01:38,19 --> 00:01:46,12
a temporary light inside the court the
court going to use to waggle around and

21
00:01:46,12 --> 00:01:50,35
never ever week. My whole access. Daddy as

22
00:01:50,35 --> 00:01:54,63
a call on the bus regularly usually asking.
Daddy who is going to be safe enough.

23
00:01:54,73 --> 00:01:58,81
You know i never had a moment's
fear that's honest. But got

24
00:01:58,81 --> 00:02:03,93
a wonderful film to work for. And you
are partly a scottish firm as well as

25
00:02:03,93 --> 00:02:09,56
a middlesbrough one weren't they not. I
know is that true. I mean as well along

26
00:02:09,56 --> 00:02:10,14
also had

27
00:02:10,14 --> 00:02:14,21
a steel mill in another. Well there's
something i didn't know but there would i

28
00:02:14,21 --> 00:02:19,87
tell you what they were good they were very
good machines were good. All right. The

29
00:02:19,87 --> 00:02:26,34
list. It was the best deal you can to
get ever get and. Well i had to be

30
00:02:26,34 --> 00:02:33,28
first class when you put you out of it.
So i'm. Inspector humor long tested them.

31
00:02:33,96 --> 00:02:39,04
At least had to come up again and then and
tell you that but whatever it was was

32
00:02:39,04 --> 00:02:45,28
perfect. It was really good. Can you
describe for the listeners. The process of

33
00:02:45,28 --> 00:02:48,78
riveting because riveting is long gone.
You know welding is taken over and people

34
00:02:48,78 --> 00:02:52,70
don't know about it these days. Can you
just describe the process from the from the

35
00:02:52,70 --> 00:02:59,70
looker on through. Well-aired
their oil fires and. That

36
00:02:59,70 --> 00:03:06,46
these. Blow pipe and the cooker
would burst blood pretty well

37
00:03:06,46 --> 00:03:12,17
just under the weight. You know and it was
shut them up to hold it up was that in

38
00:03:12,17 --> 00:03:17,94
a compressed air line. Yes and hold it
up within that have it in a hole and put

39
00:03:17,94 --> 00:03:24,26
a machine on it. And i would not give it
up. You know they all say that there live

40
00:03:24,26 --> 00:03:28,57
. It down. What exactly do you mean by not
believe it then it came out of the hole

41
00:03:28,57 --> 00:03:34,12
a vote or two in a quite
wrenches. And you had

42
00:03:34,12 --> 00:03:38,43
a snap on your machine and you
compress it down. It made

43
00:03:38,43 --> 00:03:41,75
a nice glow and you know i think it is

44
00:03:44,31 --> 00:03:50,09
a solid conservative really. It's funny
that people have difficulty describing that

45
00:03:50,09 --> 00:03:55,58
and we have you know many years later have
difficulty visible i think it. Can you

46
00:03:55,58 --> 00:04:00,32
remember the you mentioned rigor. They used
to call daddy on the on the south side

47
00:04:00,32 --> 00:04:04,56
was he the foreman regular was his no
proper name so i said yes. No i don't know

48
00:04:04,56 --> 00:04:08,86
its name was it. That's all i can remember
is everybody column daddy. You know jack

49
00:04:08,86 --> 00:04:14,11
harris then you. Yes he was on the other
side. Yes he was an outside light harris's

50
00:04:14,11 --> 00:04:19,11
. I've also heard him called the
little man with a big mouth and i used

51
00:04:19,11 --> 00:04:25,81
a girl in the human fly. What he
was capable man. Very careful man.

52
00:04:25,92 --> 00:04:30,01
But you don't know that the bloke's name
these tickled that he was the rigger can

53
00:04:30,01 --> 00:04:33,42
save the little fellow but my god he was
good not tell you something happened to

54
00:04:35,05 --> 00:04:41,43
their stedding like the card was too. And
when it came up then up to strap covered

55
00:04:41,43 --> 00:04:45,83
eyes to back and it was
a steady maintained for

56
00:04:45,83 --> 00:04:51,71
a spell it out of it. And it
would finish this particular end

57
00:04:53,24 --> 00:04:58,64
and they were going to swing the staging
ground to the next one and the two regular

58
00:04:58,64 --> 00:05:05,31
said daddy will write it round.
She's not you want. Come on off

59
00:05:06,28 --> 00:05:12,08
so they came off. Daddy went to the
green they would it matter. Right.

60
00:05:13,75 --> 00:05:19,04
Next thing the stage in break down and the
water the lost control of the drum in

61
00:05:19,04 --> 00:05:24,95
the top way you know it stagings
it funny pranks ever inch and

62
00:05:24,95 --> 00:05:31,86
a half. So it was smashed
up so that he would.

63
00:05:33,38 --> 00:05:39,78
Hear. Can you remember any accidents
working on the bridge. Yes. In fact i was

64
00:05:39,78 --> 00:05:40,24
working on

65
00:05:40,24 --> 00:05:46,16
a job. On i was on the opera house set at
the bridge and that's fellow vic kelly.

66
00:05:46,38 --> 00:05:53,36
He was in the same job as me and others
say it. And i didn't see him fall

67
00:05:53,36 --> 00:05:59,52
actually back so i'm just when
he went into the water. You know

68
00:06:00,43 --> 00:06:01,86
that i mentioned before there was

69
00:06:01,86 --> 00:06:06,76
a these working puns. Well there was one
from associate and one cannot state and

70
00:06:06,76 --> 00:06:13,29
maintain that bridge was getting pretty
well over. If kelly it a felony mining it

71
00:06:13,29 --> 00:06:15,48
a fellow know one of these
that work in punk from

72
00:06:15,48 --> 00:06:22,43
a shop but it was gone he fell in
the water and i saw him come up and

73
00:06:22,44 --> 00:06:24,66
doing a bit of breaststroke and of fell

74
00:06:24,66 --> 00:06:31,03
a dive down for them and he oblivious
said oh look my back's gone.

75
00:06:31,05 --> 00:06:34,09
Kelly lived. He just died about

76
00:06:34,09 --> 00:06:40,66
a few months ago. Kelly. There's another
fellow. I didn't see that but he

77
00:06:43,50 --> 00:06:50,47
he was screwing up. And if you don't like
it. He was screwing up both in the spine

78
00:06:50,47 --> 00:06:55,28
i slipped over the side and he
burst and i didn't find out for

79
00:06:55,28 --> 00:06:59,34
a few that. Yes i don't i have a
first hand account of that from

80
00:06:59,34 --> 00:07:06,11
a stand london who was his
boilermaker. That how to stand

81
00:07:06,11 --> 00:07:11,42
london this is alive he lives up in
merriweather in newcastle. Because he's blind.

82
00:07:11,70 --> 00:07:17,45
I think he might be down at the celebrations
next week. And we had to cancel

83
00:07:18,59 --> 00:07:19,36
have a little bit of

84
00:07:19,36 --> 00:07:24,22
a reunion out of if you want to go. Noble
get another one and then ten from the men

85
00:07:24,22 --> 00:07:29,56
noticeable cause you know but don't.
Yes. Do you remember any other accidents

86
00:07:31,54 --> 00:07:37,33
and i mean as you know if you kill
rainier. Yes about there were sixteen died

87
00:07:37,33 --> 00:07:40,52
although they weren't exactly killed
you know there's two down the quarry

88
00:07:40,52 --> 00:07:46,77
a couple in the workshops on the pylons to
on the arch one knows two on the chance

89
00:07:46,77 --> 00:07:52,71
. Although when he one fell off and died
one fell off and live to you know. And

90
00:07:52,71 --> 00:07:54,88
there was one who was killed
on the deck level with

91
00:07:54,88 --> 00:07:59,57
a plate that came down cut his leg.
But that fellow yes but there's

92
00:07:59,57 --> 00:08:04,98
a plank somewhere under british tell me
of the sky was it died. What i just said

93
00:08:04,98 --> 00:08:08,38
their names i've researched how they died
and it's in my book that i've written

94
00:08:08,38 --> 00:08:15,27
actually do you remember any im using
incidents up on the art. Well. I

95
00:08:15,27 --> 00:08:18,18
don't know well i'll tell you
i may as well tell you it was

96
00:08:18,18 --> 00:08:21,36
a long way up. You know.
And if you want to go for

97
00:08:21,36 --> 00:08:27,73
a toilet. Shut the rights
to the fact you got back.

98
00:08:28,59 --> 00:08:34,26
You didn't obey any other hold up. I
mean he did what he got in the bag

99
00:08:35,92 --> 00:08:40,79
and you folded up cereal and this is

100
00:08:40,79 --> 00:08:46,47
a fluid over and up like that. And it went
round and round and round and straight

101
00:08:46,47 --> 00:08:47,42
on the top deck of

102
00:08:47,42 --> 00:08:54,20
a fairly often wonder what
that. Yes there was. Tom evans

103
00:08:54,20 --> 00:08:54,68
who's

104
00:08:54,68 --> 00:09:01,56
a regular tell me same story only it
landed right in the feet of. Well and knew

105
00:09:01,56 --> 00:09:07,41
on the deck. That's quite possible but you
weren't bowman and where you want to lie

106
00:09:08,63 --> 00:09:13,75
. You weren't bombing the engineers were
you. No no no no. Pretty good especially

107
00:09:13,75 --> 00:09:15,81
when it was quite

108
00:09:15,81 --> 00:09:20,72
a national. Can you tell us more about the
engineers and can you tell us more about

109
00:09:20,72 --> 00:09:27,18
the engineers who worked on
the job. I remember hipwell

110
00:09:27,18 --> 00:09:33,20
yes i remember where well in fact when
i got the job he said to me. Well you

111
00:09:33,20 --> 00:09:36,72
fellows you know you come along and when
we get on the job he says you can do

112
00:09:36,72 --> 00:09:37,13
a name of

113
00:09:37,13 --> 00:09:41,31
a job we get you know and i said what
i'll tell you what i'll do you give me

114
00:09:41,31 --> 00:09:47,11
a job and if i'm not suitable you come
and tell me and i walk or she is. That's

115
00:09:47,11 --> 00:09:52,96
fair enough. That's how i got the job.
Where did you serve your time. John

116
00:09:52,96 --> 00:09:58,02
brennan's and played bank scotland and
when did you come to australia. I came out

117
00:09:58,02 --> 00:10:04,64
here to 1923. I was in
victoria for when it's over.

118
00:10:06,33 --> 00:10:12,55
And that's when i come over to the new south
will. And by the way i saw you working

119
00:10:12,55 --> 00:10:18,35
on the sydney aba bridge and got a job
on the story bridge up in queensland. As

120
00:10:18,35 --> 00:10:22,59
a first couple of years. What sort of
comparison was there between the work on this

121
00:10:22,59 --> 00:10:23,20
standard

122
00:10:23,20 --> 00:10:27,79
a work on the sydney harbour bridge and the
story bridge. We could in fact what in

123
00:10:27,79 --> 00:10:34,69
the shop for evans dickens and.
The stand that it was very good

124
00:10:34,69 --> 00:10:40,52
very very good indeed all the plates
were whitewashed in scribd and

125
00:10:41,49 --> 00:10:45,45
just had to be you know so so you
know what they do you know on

126
00:10:45,45 --> 00:10:46,32
a segment of sydney

127
00:10:46,32 --> 00:10:52,75
a bit but it's what they do it's
symbolises the job on the show and

128
00:10:52,76 --> 00:10:57,00
assemble an expert yet to be sort of the
one that gets up in the talk. There's no

129
00:10:57,00 --> 00:11:03,20
trouble. You know you only allowed six and
challenging the votes. Do you remember

130
00:11:03,20 --> 00:11:08,45
what it was like riveting upside down the
cover plate along the chords. Yes as

131
00:11:08,45 --> 00:11:14,97
a pretty thing you mention that.
Whole time and what their job.

132
00:11:16,00 --> 00:11:21,77
Do and up one revis as you call them
wanted one to come out on never said maybe

133
00:11:21,77 --> 00:11:26,54
even don't hand yet more levity
coming up and should be but

134
00:11:28,70 --> 00:11:34,03
exactly how did you do. Do it when you doing
up and riveting. That's why it was one

135
00:11:34,04 --> 00:11:40,92
of the staging before it was just whoever
designed it knew what he was doing.

136
00:11:40,93 --> 00:11:46,99
If you look that of us from the me you
were set and then like you would have it

137
00:11:46,99 --> 00:11:53,91
coming through you. You drew it up. It was
really good. And that's changing with

138
00:11:54,80 --> 00:12:00,23
just right. Just you could just get that
you know as i've said i've ever comes out

139
00:12:00,23 --> 00:12:03,80
of it too you know our plans are to unicorn
and shoot if you just enough momentum

140
00:12:03,80 --> 00:12:10,68
to. Enough leverage to get up. There
must be pretty hard work. Oh yes it was

141
00:12:10,68 --> 00:12:13,67
hard but how many rivets.
Would you drive up in

142
00:12:13,67 --> 00:12:18,28
a shift or you will see

143
00:12:18,28 --> 00:12:24,12
a vote or hell you didn't
say about sixty it was all

144
00:12:25,38 --> 00:12:27,15
a little bit you know
what an inch and a nation

145
00:12:27,15 --> 00:12:30,45
a quarter they were big rivers.
As big a division never

146
00:12:30,45 --> 00:12:34,79
a joy of did you ever go in the
chords. In the court most of the time

147
00:12:34,79 --> 00:12:40,83
a funny thing was. When the
come up and then the bus

148
00:12:41,89 --> 00:12:46,87
will have it john. And that's what i
mostly did and i mean inside the court you

149
00:12:46,87 --> 00:12:53,00
know you hold up was in there was any ben
inside the chords. Yeah well they caught

150
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:55,99
us and three on the to a stage i was

151
00:12:55,99 --> 00:13:01,100
a sad bush you know both sides but then
on the come at the center i was inside.

152
00:13:04,38 --> 00:13:09,92
Yes. So what was it like in the
good. Yes it was great it was

153
00:13:09,92 --> 00:13:16,91
a. As i say you were under way to
late. You know hot. Not really cold

154
00:13:16,92 --> 00:13:21,98
in winter and summer time yes that's
another thing too in the winter time you

155
00:13:21,98 --> 00:13:27,56
mentioned just now know when we went up.
Number one thing it was foggy is how

156
00:13:29,07 --> 00:13:35,82
you see the ferries here the fairies and
down below and then up to the qualia right

157
00:13:35,82 --> 00:13:42,01
above the fog and they shun sheen
and fog which is level as could be

158
00:13:43,07 --> 00:13:47,72
if it's essentially someone good up to all
of that i made of an hour. Certainly but

159
00:13:47,72 --> 00:13:53,42
that you wouldn't believe the fog was level
you know what the trouble is i've seen

160
00:13:53,42 --> 00:13:57,10
that in the country areas where you get
it. See just the tops of trees coming out

161
00:13:57,10 --> 00:13:57,70
of it what it looks like

162
00:13:57,70 --> 00:14:03,55
a lake. Just see the aeroplanes come up
through the fog and flying along the top.

163
00:14:03,57 --> 00:14:07,53
Serving of china. I was
sorry when i get put off

Yeah i get my do they take up

166
00:14:16,46 --> 00:14:20,49

No they did not. But some of the some of

167
00:14:20,49 --> 00:14:23,65
the people say that they got to goodness
knows how much money out of it or

168
00:14:23,65 --> 00:14:29,93
a clock or something. Now like it. Nothing
i don't know why i'd get nothing. I kept

169
00:14:29,93 --> 00:14:30,73
it to quite

170
00:14:30,73 --> 00:14:35,69
a set point i didn't tell anyone i told

a long she's to take the side in the
same night and coming back here.

174
00:14:55,37 --> 00:15:01,85
When i get put off there was the money

175
00:15:01,85 --> 00:15:07,19
depression times you know and the money

176
00:15:07,19 --> 00:15:14,15
a big pay or corrupted and
coming to us. Both you know

177
00:15:14,15 --> 00:15:19,67
sydney again the lines. I was on the job
says well done on sort of allusion here. I

178
00:15:19,67 --> 00:15:25,07

of work ahead of me. She's not my work.

179

A fellow clean windows me to
get with him when he used

184
00:15:55,13 --> 00:15:59,78
a payment and so i think. There
were tough times. I'll tell you

185
00:15:59,78 --> 00:16:04,66
a very tough times. He remember other
things about those times you were married

186
00:16:04,66 --> 00:16:11,54
then. Weren't you. Yes. Where
did you get your dole or

187
00:16:11,54 --> 00:16:17,91
did you just you got the coupons or did
you pick it up in kind. No pins and you

188
00:16:17,91 --> 00:16:24,81
just only got fifteen bob. And yes
very poor different you know it is i

189
00:16:24,82 --> 00:16:31,37
can get through alright here. Did you get
money for cooking. You know for the meter

190
00:16:32,79 --> 00:16:37,18
. To cook your food. Oh i certainly got
their coupons or so and they made it that

191
00:16:37,18 --> 00:16:41,20
we couldn't get cigarettes through through
the thing and some people did you know

192
00:16:41,20 --> 00:16:47,28
but it was tough times. I'll tell you do
you remember the dole inspectors. Yes and

193
00:16:47,29 --> 00:16:52,77
fight one of their children specters
somebody don't mean do you. And that's yet

194
00:16:52,77 --> 00:16:58,88
doing this cleanly infallible for this
fella and he's waiting for me and

195
00:17:01,33 --> 00:17:01,56
that was

196
00:17:01,56 --> 00:17:07,07
a really satisfying that. Is specter was
quite satisfied that i was doing was all

197
00:17:07,07 --> 00:17:10,98
right. And we had to do
something in them days what was

198
00:17:10,98 --> 00:17:14,88
a vent now fifteen but what
it. Those fifteen vibe

199
00:17:14,88 --> 00:17:17,97
a week. You got for dolan fifteen but week
is well you know if you couldn't use you

200
00:17:17,97 --> 00:17:22,87
coupons for rent. Could you. Oh no no no
no not yet do you find your rent somewhere

201
00:17:24,42 --> 00:17:31,17
where you find it. Yes. Do you use state
in sydney all that time or did you take to

202
00:17:31,17 --> 00:17:37,00
the track at all. I know i know my status.
I am freaked out after that i got

203
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:40,57
a job through that been able
to do that. I got a job in

204
00:17:40,57 --> 00:17:43,89
a kind of street in sydney as a
cleaner and what was there for

205
00:17:43,89 --> 00:17:49,92
a while. And that's what i went up to

206
00:17:51,66 --> 00:17:52,32
do that.

207
00:17:59,45 --> 00:18:01,25
I made out vacation forever
stations and i got

208
00:18:01,25 --> 00:18:05,19
a job. I swear went up there so that was
the next job you got in your trade when

209
00:18:05,19 --> 00:18:11,42
was that what year was that six from terry
one if that issue and was hand. I mean

210
00:18:12,30 --> 00:18:18,91
that he had no you can look back on it
because someone was younger than he could

211
00:18:18,91 --> 00:18:21,83
but a lot of things are you
know get a dollar here

212
00:18:21,83 --> 00:18:27,97
a quid there somewhere someone to keep
things going. Do you remember the working

213
00:18:27,97 --> 00:18:32,21
conditions generally on the bridge. You
know the answer. There was terrific

214
00:18:33,86 --> 00:18:38,73
wonderful film to work and everything
was machines were good. Everything was

215
00:18:38,73 --> 00:18:43,79
fostered out and the in the mess i said
the material it was everything was up to

216
00:18:43,79 --> 00:18:46,74
you know. In fact it's
the best job ever. What

217
00:18:46,74 --> 00:18:51,59
a life. Jevon you ever see or have anything
to do with conversation with ennis or

218
00:18:51,59 --> 00:18:58,56
bad feel now. And he wouldn't maybe.

219
00:18:58,58 --> 00:19:03,100
Another facet of it. Do you member
anything union activity on the job.

220
00:19:05,84 --> 00:19:11,55
No not really of us. But the good fun as
it was concerned the money was good. You

221
00:19:11,55 --> 00:19:16,25
know them days used to get.
When what would you guess

222
00:19:16,25 --> 00:19:22,27
a long way to go back is
to get nine prior and

223
00:19:23,37 --> 00:19:29,42
up till the planning and then from there.
Finally you get ten point fifteen when i

224
00:19:29,42 --> 00:19:32,99
was good money there were days when the
boilermakers job an hour lunch out would be

225
00:19:32,99 --> 00:19:39,49
about £5. I was good to see the
lady who used to work in the pay

226
00:19:39,49 --> 00:19:44,12
offices one of those is still alive and
the other day she was one of the blokes

227
00:19:44,12 --> 00:19:49,14
there reckoned that he got short paid one
and threepence on his last pay and he was

228
00:19:49,14 --> 00:19:55,34
on about it so long that she getting twenty
cents. She did. I did at that frank go

229
00:19:55,34 --> 00:20:02,00
there. I did and i said now the bit where
i tell you put the right of abilities you

230
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:07,87
call it. And i hit it and said it and that
diddler hit my finger and that ball and

231
00:20:07,87 --> 00:20:14,07
now it's split and it's course
like that. So there's not so

232
00:20:15,19 --> 00:20:20,26
could you explain that what you just said
to take the what of what tool to do you

233
00:20:20,26 --> 00:20:25,22
use to take the birr office it off
their whole planet. I was just

234
00:20:26,44 --> 00:20:33,41
a tool you put in the hall and i just
wanted the. Any level. Ray which is on

235
00:20:33,41 --> 00:20:39,73
the book as you call it. Do you member any
rivets being cut out and the way you cut

236
00:20:39,73 --> 00:20:42,69
them out. Yes. I cut plenty

237
00:20:42,69 --> 00:20:49,07
a hitch. But tell you now.
No you. As i said and spent

238
00:20:49,07 --> 00:20:52,73
a long and tested job made of then you get

239
00:20:52,73 --> 00:20:59,67
a chip machine machine and these
tools to cut that have it if you cut

240
00:20:59,67 --> 00:21:02,82
that about it and punch it out nude of

241
00:21:02,82 --> 00:21:09,78
a chain. Along came inspect it again. He
would test again. Had to be right before

242
00:21:09,78 --> 00:21:15,08
he left would let you go to is all they
were terrific and that you couldn't

243
00:21:15,08 --> 00:21:16,76
material that if it was slack it was just

244
00:21:16,76 --> 00:21:22,07
a gesture. They used to hammer them and
hold them with their fingers and say if it

245
00:21:22,07 --> 00:21:22,26
was not

246
00:21:22,26 --> 00:21:27,96
a river rattle it spittle very small little
hammer hit them one way and then it hit

247
00:21:27,96 --> 00:21:34,45
the back of the lists least genitalia
to him. So that reg is tight

248
00:21:35,63 --> 00:21:37,28
as a tail what i think

249
00:21:37,28 --> 00:21:42,97
a theme in ten. But you really should do.
I mean paint it well enough but should

250
00:21:42,97 --> 00:21:45,88
last forever because the
bessa but is still best

251
00:21:45,89 --> 00:21:52,82
a steel. You were at the schwinn when

252
00:21:52,82 --> 00:21:59,80
it was joined where you. Yes yes i was
at when it joined yes. Would you let you

253
00:21:59,80 --> 00:22:03,28
know whether. Well you were actually up
there the night it was joined or we up

254
00:22:03,28 --> 00:22:10,22
around about that time. Well
what i know about it was on

255
00:22:10,23 --> 00:22:16,76
that day was they got result except on the
generals and they took fort as it was

256
00:22:17,61 --> 00:22:21,39
as a frenchman took for us it's

257
00:22:21,40 --> 00:22:25,68
a funny thing. This man. It made

258
00:22:25,69 --> 00:22:31,93
a book but all about the bridge are any
malard i think as his name too. Although so

259
00:22:31,93 --> 00:22:33,69
one. Photo

260
00:22:34,99 --> 00:22:39,04
a book i've seen that
wasn't them was enough. So

261
00:22:43,73 --> 00:22:47,01
that's the only time i get my foot it taken
as i was gently before the usually in

262
00:22:47,01 --> 00:22:50,57
the court. But i put a
wise one time was that

263
00:22:50,57 --> 00:22:55,96
a sane one so people up there
taking photos and that was

264
00:22:55,96 --> 00:23:02,93
a noise. I never get my
foot. It's funny but. Up on

265
00:23:02,93 --> 00:23:08,70
that bridge well. That that it wet and
the weather. You know the weather with

266
00:23:08,70 --> 00:23:08,93
played

267
00:23:08,93 --> 00:23:15,07
a part you know but it was joined at night
because i wasn't there then when you

268
00:23:15,07 --> 00:23:17,95
manage getting here can where you know
if you were out there. Do you get

269
00:23:17,95 --> 00:23:18,39
a sovereign or

270
00:23:18,39 --> 00:23:24,32
a camera to bulb it to bob. So i go and
fight might be around somewhere yet i've

271
00:23:24,32 --> 00:23:29,51
got some things and now i might
be there. Yet you've got to has

272
00:23:29,52 --> 00:23:35,34
a metal. I wish i never was for all four
i didn't intentionally do it. I just

273
00:23:35,34 --> 00:23:38,21
happen when i get paid
off. I happen to have

274
00:23:38,21 --> 00:23:43,28
a pocket have it neck and some ice around
somewhere so that was the timekeepers

275
00:23:43,28 --> 00:23:47,51
metal so i used it. Yeah it when you went
up you pick what you pick the metal up my

276
00:23:47,51 --> 00:23:52,56
was for that was that as
security thing as well as being

277
00:23:52,56 --> 00:23:56,98
a timekeepers thing i know i don't think
so now you know i don't know if there's

278
00:23:56,98 --> 00:24:02,20
a version or scares. Nothing there that you
just hang your medal up by that by the

279
00:24:02,20 --> 00:24:06,67
clock when you came back we pick it up and
then you turn your puter back any you

280
00:24:06,67 --> 00:24:10,42
know if you lunchtime you could have had
can't remember that i know at night time

281
00:24:10,42 --> 00:24:16,58
you put it back any that was current
for here now you're off the job. And i

282
00:24:17,52 --> 00:24:20,12
heard you can you member of the other
momentos you might have had from the bridge

283
00:24:20,12 --> 00:24:27,04
like rivets you didn't give any of them to
know i'll tell you. So my doctor just up

284
00:24:27,04 --> 00:24:32,31
was talking to doctors
cuddy. His son gave him

285
00:24:32,31 --> 00:24:38,67
a book on the bridge and another
patient. It was telling this

286
00:24:39,48 --> 00:24:43,41
this other fellow about it and it shows
you that you get to your patients here we

287
00:24:43,41 --> 00:24:48,88
don't need is he. What can anybody birds.
So when i went up there born there but.

288
00:24:49,23 --> 00:24:55,38
Well i had books. Like hardcover
things but self one about the bridge.

289
00:24:56,94 --> 00:24:57,64
He said he was taking

290
00:24:57,64 --> 00:25:03,36
a big interest an average. So i gave them
to him. So you might even get someone

291
00:25:03,36 --> 00:25:08,06
over him. A telfair yes i know dr.

292
00:25:08,06 --> 00:25:08,45
Carey it's

293
00:25:08,45 --> 00:25:13,77
a i've got plenty of documentary evidence
all i wear on about people's reminiscences

294
00:25:13,77 --> 00:25:19,63
now i see. Well things that you can
remember that nobody else would know. Well

295
00:25:19,64 --> 00:25:25,88
that's pretty well covered. Although some
things come up. I'm down. Whole bit.
