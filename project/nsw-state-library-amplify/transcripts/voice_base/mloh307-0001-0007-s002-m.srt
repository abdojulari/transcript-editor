1
00:00:16,42 --> 00:00:20,87
This is identification this is Station seven with faith bender

2
00:00:20,87 --> 00:00:29,65
and the tape of it in a few seconds invited occasion this is site to. FACE. You have an amazing photograph.

3
00:00:29,96 --> 00:00:35,4
Just behind us which has as a group a group of men taken at the Berlin festival

4
00:00:35,4 --> 00:00:46,32
and they include a frank hearty pep lonely reader and Shostakovich and could you talk about that photograph

5
00:00:46,32 --> 00:00:54,58
and about the people who were at the festival. Well.

6
00:00:55,94 --> 00:01:01,00
We got together a group of us got together in different school buildings

7
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:08,52
or whatever was standing in what it was left standing. And.

8
00:01:11,03 --> 00:01:17,02
One of the young German people who were looking after us said Would you like to go

9
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:22,98
and meet some of the of the delegates not mentioning that. There.

10
00:01:23,95 --> 00:01:31,66
They've got some cheese there and that was important and they all have some wine I think are said oh yes I'd like to.

11
00:01:31,97 --> 00:01:38,27
So we went off and this was how I remember.

12
00:01:38,29 --> 00:01:45,69
The building or three well but I remember the room and there was nothing in the room. Nothing whatsoever.

13
00:01:45,71 --> 00:01:51,83
And the cheese and the prayer and it was just on the floor.

14
00:01:51,85 --> 00:02:02,56
And there was a man sitting there who beckoned me to sit next to him next to him and he picked up my.

15
00:02:03,47 --> 00:02:13,71
And he said You've got beautiful. I have to confess I.

16
00:02:13,94 --> 00:02:21,02
Nothing obvious because you know that women everywhere didn't worry me until I suppose thirty years later

17
00:02:21,02 --> 00:02:35,51
when Russell Drysdale said to me I want to paint your hands and then I remember for shots and he held my hand

18
00:02:35,51 --> 00:02:42,11
and I looked at his hand and it was almost as black as mine with nicotine.

19
00:02:42,12 --> 00:02:52,02
And he had a fair bit of cheese and red wine by this time and he was you know jolly. And there was an alder.

20
00:02:53,1 --> 00:02:55,79
Gramophone in the corner you know that you wind up.

21
00:02:57,77 --> 00:03:06,33
And someone had put one of his compositions on and a young man and he was just and exact.

22
00:03:08,67 --> 00:03:13,84
Playing this record these records a little pile of them and they were seventy eight.

23
00:03:13,88 --> 00:03:23,74
So of course they had to be changed every three and a half minutes or so. And it was and he was this company.

24
00:03:23,76 --> 00:03:41,63
Beating time with the other end. And I recall reading poetry. I didn't know this poetry at all.

25
00:03:41,65 --> 00:03:54,77
You know I was pretty sure that you know you. Music but your best bet was. I can't remember who took the photographs.

26
00:03:54,89 --> 00:04:00,73
I have a feeling it was a member of it and screw the would have limited events at that party

27
00:04:01,63 --> 00:04:12,84
but I can tell you we went to Charlie and who got stuck into the wall and the T. Hese really. Surrounded the whole has.

28
00:04:12,86 --> 00:04:26,29
Limits. Well. At the end of oh I must not forget to tell you that when I arrived in valley.

29
00:04:27,79 --> 00:04:41,94
Who should I meet another man whom I had met at an International Peace Congress and. I stayed with him and his wife.

30
00:04:43,05 --> 00:04:50,81
One hundred forty or fifty not quite sure. Just before he went to Philly and they were there.

31
00:04:51,19 --> 00:04:57,66
And he was on she was on sabbatical. She was the first woman engineer in Australia.

32
00:05:00,06 --> 00:05:08,77
And he was the chief of the Forestry Department Tory had just under four hours from

33
00:05:08,77 --> 00:05:18,84
and this was in the Cold War was beginning and they were out to trap him. Because he was a left wing.

34
00:05:18,86 --> 00:05:23,79
And he would have framed him. So he resigned.

35
00:05:23,8 --> 00:05:28,68
And picked up best picked up the money and went off and explained quite some years

36
00:05:28,68 --> 00:05:38,08
and months in India before going on to believe. And their relationship wasn't the best.

37
00:05:38,92 --> 00:05:55,52
They were only speaking to each other. So they named. ALAN KOHLER Of course his name.

38
00:05:55,54 --> 00:06:06,07
He was involved in a very serious accident Victoria. And lost a leg. And he was travelling quite.

39
00:06:06,55 --> 00:06:23,56
Driving managing quite well. Minus one leg. I think that happened around in the big push for. Anyhow. So there he was.

40
00:06:23,58 --> 00:06:38,43
And he was one came back to see this person whom I had a conference and he said to me where I was staying

41
00:06:38,43 --> 00:06:48,81
and I told him so we got together and he said to me I then said Look I've got a friend here

42
00:06:49,57 --> 00:06:54,66
and I think you should meet him. And I took him to meet.

43
00:06:55,61 --> 00:06:59,45
And they were very impressed with each other they were good company.

44
00:07:00,43 --> 00:07:13,6
And said look the East German forestry looking for very experienced engineers. I think you should apply.

45
00:07:15,78 --> 00:07:21,04
I think they did. And they were also having trouble with.

46
00:07:21,06 --> 00:07:35,04
Housing they pigs and the pigs would have wanted this because they'd killed all the good brains of any. Perhaps.

47
00:07:35,05 --> 00:07:50,00
The housing of Pigs which was extremely important to the country. Main source of. Meat. So.

48
00:07:50,02 --> 00:08:01,54
Couple of years here would be interesting and he was speaking a fair bit. So he went to the Forestry Department.

49
00:08:01,55 --> 00:08:16,01
I think she took him. And talked staying in Germany and they were enthusiastic court yesterday. I didn't look that.

50
00:08:16,61 --> 00:08:21,38
I remember him telling me like. He didn't like the look of one.

51
00:08:23,77 --> 00:08:39,28
And he said to me at the time I think it was the top Nazi. The day after he was arrested and police.

52
00:08:39,29 --> 00:08:53,59
Taken to the police station all or none of us knew. And was told he forces and he would have to pay the price.

53
00:08:53,61 --> 00:09:02,63
And I kept in the here for about six hours. Fortunately he was going to meet with us to learn most of it.

54
00:09:02,65 --> 00:09:08,79
So it was found out what had happened.

55
00:09:11,06 --> 00:09:22,48
You know I mean the irony here of communism was quite prevalent there in East Berlin. They had us all on their control.

56
00:09:22,92 --> 00:09:32,83
And they known to us you know all that was of it was he released. He was released he was released.

57
00:09:32,85 --> 00:09:37,49
And he and his wife in life.

58
00:09:41,17 --> 00:09:49,54
So that made me feel very uncomfortable exceptionally uncomfort uncomfortable and the thing that.

59
00:09:49,55 --> 00:09:54,99
That disturbed me most of all. The Communists in the delegation.

60
00:09:56,88 --> 00:10:03,34
Could see no wrong in anything that was done by our hosts nothing.

61
00:10:03,36 --> 00:10:08,68
I just want to come back to a slow who said to me one morning. She came and picked me up but.

62
00:10:09,01 --> 00:10:19,56
You know they we only had in the schools we only had a bed. So that was it. There was no way to put it.

63
00:10:20,98 --> 00:10:29,39
And I cannot tell you have a primitive the washing facilities were but it didn't matter.

64
00:10:29,4 --> 00:10:37,39
Anyhow and she came and picked me up and she said.

65
00:10:37,41 --> 00:10:44,79
I want to take you to make my brother he was a Nazi and I didn't like him but I'd still like to meet him

66
00:10:44,79 --> 00:10:57,49
and he was lecturing in the university. So she did the edge and. When we left she said. He gave his life to.

67
00:10:59,23 --> 00:11:04,96
Yes So there were very.

68
00:11:05,97 --> 00:11:15,81
Can I just ask you something about just because of age talk politics because of course he was at that stage I would

69
00:11:15,81 --> 00:11:23,94
have thought quite well known as an opponent of the Russian government.

70
00:11:23,95 --> 00:11:32,93
Not quite at that time because I would never have let him into his trial.

71
00:11:33,59 --> 00:11:43,24
But it happened after that and I think actually it happened around about the mid sixty's if I can remember.

72
00:11:43,26 --> 00:11:57,07
And he wasn't going to talk politics he just wanted to have a bloody good time. Anyhow.

73
00:11:57,09 --> 00:12:02,77
The leaders of delegation quarter sort. And said now.

74
00:12:03,25 --> 00:12:15,72
The delegations from the other countries have invited to visit a country and I read up at least the. So many to Moscow.

75
00:12:15,77 --> 00:12:26,32
So many going to many to China. And it went on. And maybe I was going with a group.

76
00:12:26,34 --> 00:12:39,4
That was to go to Gary or of all places. Well of course Belgariad and the communists in it but it was in many ways.

77
00:12:40,41 --> 00:12:45,76
So let me come back so that they said you have to pack today and you're going off tomorrow.

78
00:12:47,49 --> 00:12:52,76
And I think there were about five of us from the delegation that went on to about Kerry.

79
00:12:54,5 --> 00:13:02,68
And the trains once again took us off at a very slow pace. And I was pleased because I was able to see.

80
00:13:02,69 --> 00:13:12,43
Czechoslovakia which was green again. And we stopped in the station and proud.

81
00:13:12,44 --> 00:13:26,88
Came and greeted me and she put her arms around me. And the tears came. We have suffered.

82
00:13:26,9 --> 00:13:34,04
Lost so many of our own people and war is a terrible thing when you go back to Australia.

83
00:13:34,06 --> 00:13:42,63
Make sure that I work for peace. I admired the white jumper she had at our.

84
00:13:43,07 --> 00:13:48,87
And she took it all pulled it off and gave it to me. It was beautiful.

85
00:13:49,3 --> 00:13:54,12
We didn't stay as long as I would like to have stayed going through.

86
00:13:55,85 --> 00:14:02,01
But the ducks if we were here you know they'd succeeded in getting their backs off the ground again.

87
00:14:02,27 --> 00:14:19,94
But she'd come to the station just wanting to greet one particular person. And. She brought a little. Little pottery.

88
00:14:19,96 --> 00:14:27,7
And put it in my hands and then the train moved off and we went on to Poland.

89
00:14:28,07 --> 00:14:34,61
And we also we had in the train the delegates who were going to go on to the Soviet Union

90
00:14:35,36 --> 00:14:42,19
and I think we're going to I'm not sure where they were changing. Trains it could have been in Warsaw.

91
00:14:42,45 --> 00:14:59,58
But when we got off. And we were retained there and taken to the Margaret Margaret. For a night out by the locals.

92
00:14:59,6 --> 00:15:13,59
And the man who was sort of leader of the group. Was a pianist. Anyhow they took us in about it.

93
00:15:15,13 --> 00:15:21,72
And he said this is the this is where the British Bush was he played

94
00:15:22,73 --> 00:15:34,69
and in fact it was a place where what was the name of that awful King. It would've Yes The Nazi. That's right.

95
00:15:34,86 --> 00:15:37,13
Well Simpson and.

96
00:15:37,15 --> 00:15:49,32
KING Did all the playing apparently on this particular are not well we played at the end staff eight of them.

97
00:15:51,5 --> 00:15:54,99
I just want to say when I went back to that was simple depressed

98
00:15:54,99 --> 00:16:04,76
when I went back to put a pistol space about fifteen years after the war they didn't think most of the bullets were

99
00:16:04,76 --> 00:16:18,25
still on the wall. So sad terrible but anyhow. We went up from the to Bucharest. And once again. Had a wonderful time.

100
00:16:20,04 --> 00:16:27,12
Took us out to their nightclubs I think we stayed about two nights there because the trains move so slowly so you had

101
00:16:27,12 --> 00:16:41,77
to give other trains a go. To two artists delegation were given scholarships but they remain in people to paint.

102
00:16:43,34 --> 00:17:02,57
One is very famous in Australia. I think of his name later. I can think of his name. So. We went on from there.

103
00:17:02,69 --> 00:17:12,52
And finally. I should really have have the photograph a to show you of all in Sofia in vogue area and.

104
00:17:13,11 --> 00:17:24,69
I came off this train and just looked at a sea of faces. And the who cannot describe it.

105
00:17:24,81 --> 00:17:29,8
I couldn't see anything but just faces.

106
00:17:29,82 --> 00:17:41,39
It looked as though the whole city had closed up to the railway station and taken to the best hotel in the city.

107
00:17:42,6 --> 00:17:53,54
And I wasn't used to. Any have taken to the hill and there I was being waited on.

108
00:17:54,14 --> 00:18:02,62
You know the servants couldn't do a half and what. And she made my bed.

109
00:18:02,64 --> 00:18:14,82
Took my laundry who I am I couldn't believe this. And she became rather friendly. One morning she could. I mean.

110
00:18:15,94 --> 00:18:25,39
With the whole record. And among the records were records of Paul.

111
00:18:25,4 --> 00:18:33,97
But the racist and the means to being about twelve were preachers of STAR loans.

112
00:18:33,99 --> 00:18:44,91
Oh yes you see the Bulgarian working class and the vast majority were peasants and workers. Well into the country.

113
00:18:44,93 --> 00:18:48,14
It was being controlled. Nobody could question.

114
00:18:48,48 --> 00:18:53,71
It was blatant but then so it was great because they had food to eat

115
00:18:54,48 --> 00:19:06,44
and they worked for wages many of whom never worked. So we arrived there and were made very welcome.

116
00:19:06,44 --> 00:19:14,04
As I said then couple of their leaders came in and said We are taking you to a welcome.

117
00:19:16,89 --> 00:19:19,7
Local Council I think it was all the equivalent.

118
00:19:20,92 --> 00:19:24,97
And the prime minister will be there so we went along

119
00:19:25,83 --> 00:19:38,93
and we danced with the prime minister in the horror you know real not club that was one day I got a lot of photographs

120
00:19:40,17 --> 00:19:45,45
and there I am with two The members of the dance group and they are also all of these blokes

121
00:19:45,45 --> 00:19:54,49
and these people got so drunk on slivovitz so much so we thought God where is the hotel.

122
00:19:55,33 --> 00:20:02,59
Not to be where he picked us up took us. This is amazing response to you. Was it.

123
00:20:02,69 --> 00:20:08,08
Patti that you were a novelty or had been advanced publicist.

124
00:20:08,1 --> 00:20:18,21
There was nothing other than my performance in early June. Nothing. And not only that you see.

125
00:20:18,79 --> 00:20:22,74
I work I guess our voice unique. I think they want us.

126
00:20:22,79 --> 00:20:35,62
I said that they expected the whole delegation to be polite and to hear the word true because one. Do you understand.

127
00:20:35,64 --> 00:20:37,66
It's quite a personal if and.
