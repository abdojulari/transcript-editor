1
00:00:02,98 --> 00:00:06,85
Now mr. Mayor archie meek worked on the
sydney harbour bridge when he was only

2
00:00:06,85 --> 00:00:10,71
a young fellow do you remember those years.
Do you when you were first taken on can

3
00:00:10,71 --> 00:00:13,40
you remember being given a job
i can remember being given

4
00:00:13,40 --> 00:00:20,30
a job and i worked for dave irvine which
foreman at the time and i went with the

5
00:00:20,30 --> 00:00:25,05
riveters on the hydraulic
riveting machines they were

6
00:00:25,05 --> 00:00:31,54
a big horse shoe type and the rivet
risqué used instead of hammer down like

7
00:00:31,54 --> 00:00:36,67
a rattler machine. How
many were you are you in

8
00:00:36,67 --> 00:00:42,65
a gang of four the hydraulic riveting.
Oh they will be for assistance in

9
00:00:42,65 --> 00:00:45,76
a ball and i have what it
each of you do. That's

10
00:00:45,76 --> 00:00:50,64
a first one to one of them heated the
rivets and the other one right group the

11
00:00:50,64 --> 00:00:55,66
gantry another on his shop
bought out the two used one pass

12
00:00:55,66 --> 00:01:00,67
a revit and the other used to push
the big pull the big hoses had

13
00:01:00,67 --> 00:01:04,71
a held up of course opposite the
boiler maker. And he didn't need

14
00:01:04,71 --> 00:01:05,87
a car he didn't need

15
00:01:05,87 --> 00:01:10,80
a catcher and that job. You know we were
on ground level the reverse was thrown

16
00:01:10,80 --> 00:01:17,58
underneath the job on the ground all
dirt floor. And then the hold up

17
00:01:17,58 --> 00:01:20,42
picked it up put it in the
hole and so now we had

18
00:01:20,42 --> 00:01:26,81
a boy put it in the house. We still
have big heavy rivets because the

19
00:01:27,71 --> 00:01:34,42
plates were about an inch thick. And
they were sometimes six and eight

20
00:01:34,42 --> 00:01:40,84
cly. So the rivers have to be about
eight or nine inches long and

21
00:01:40,85 --> 00:01:46,32
a boy you know about seventeen. Yes.
At the use tongs in one hand and

22
00:01:46,32 --> 00:01:51,83
a seven pound hammer now that hammer i
mean to the horse and they did you do any

23
00:01:51,84 --> 00:01:57,41
any pneumatic riveting after that.
I know i didn't work with them.

24
00:01:59,14 --> 00:02:06,14
But most of the jobs we did
was for the big big columns

25
00:02:06,14 --> 00:02:11,18
you know our shoes and everything and they
went from our shop up to the heavy shop

26
00:02:11,18 --> 00:02:17,41
and they were all put together and build
like boxes big box girders that's where

27
00:02:17,41 --> 00:02:23,67
they used to handle everything. And how
long did you work there in the workshop. I

28
00:02:23,67 --> 00:02:27,28
worked there for about three
years. How it was sort of

29
00:02:27,28 --> 00:02:33,31
a job was it you get good money. At
that time was start of the depression

30
00:02:34,27 --> 00:02:39,76
or money was good that time and because
we never thought we got enough because we

31
00:02:39,76 --> 00:02:45,77
had to work very hard at the amount of the
working conditions in the workshops or

32
00:02:45,77 --> 00:02:50,56
our working conditions was continuous all
the time and i don't mean the conditions

33
00:02:50,56 --> 00:02:56,05
i mean the nature of the job we would go
from one job to another while we're away

34
00:02:56,05 --> 00:03:00,40
on one job they were turning the other
one over. So who you. We never stopped.

35
00:03:01,85 --> 00:03:05,08
There was hard work along for lunch

36
00:03:05,08 --> 00:03:11,36
a. Well we had it. We were in shift
work. We were going from seven or three

37
00:03:11,36 --> 00:03:18,25
one shift with about half an hour break
and we were going from free to eleven on

38
00:03:18,26 --> 00:03:22,81
another shift to member dave
avandia the foreman. I remembered

39
00:03:22,81 --> 00:03:28,87
a bourbon well yes. But the hard
man was well dave was fair.

40
00:03:30,06 --> 00:03:36,05
He was one of the boys he well liked
and whatever they said went you know.

41
00:03:37,31 --> 00:03:40,25
Do you member any union
meetings in the shop. There was

42
00:03:40,25 --> 00:03:46,71
a lot of union meetings. But b and yari
most of the meetings there were with

43
00:03:46,71 --> 00:03:47,36
a boilermakers

44
00:03:47,36 --> 00:03:53,56
a c and we were only the boys. You didn't
go up on the arch at all to yourself.

45
00:03:55,42 --> 00:03:59,24
If we had time at lunch time we used to
try and run up there. But it was also

46
00:03:59,24 --> 00:04:02,96
letters and. It took

47
00:04:02,96 --> 00:04:09,60
a long while to get up there. Did you do
you remember any any amusing things that

48
00:04:09,60 --> 00:04:13,19
happened while you were
in there. Not very many

49
00:04:17,06 --> 00:04:23,59
. But an accident so many many hard things
that. That strike you made now either

50
00:04:23,60 --> 00:04:27,21
a lot of berms and everything but it was

51
00:04:27,21 --> 00:04:33,65
a well-conducted shop. Everything
went along like on assembly line and

52
00:04:34,57 --> 00:04:41,50
. The job was hard and you still
lose plenty of sweat but it was

53
00:04:41,50 --> 00:04:47,17
no well-conducted well organized. What
happened to you after you finished up what

54
00:04:47,17 --> 00:04:53,90
you did you finish up first. I finished
about 1931 after they just finished the

55
00:04:53,90 --> 00:04:59,71
roadway and. I left there and

56
00:05:00,96 --> 00:05:07,82
after that i worked around casual picking
up work wherever i could until about

57
00:05:07,82 --> 00:05:08,22
an hour and

58
00:05:08,22 --> 00:05:14,94
a thirty six. And i went to new guinea where
they were building gold regions cedar

59
00:05:14,95 --> 00:05:19,90
they vervain up there to do i miss dave
ever and then he had just left and he went

60
00:05:19,90 --> 00:05:25,81
back to cockatoo. So i worked up there
for about three years and i came back i

61
00:05:25,81 --> 00:05:26,07
worked

62
00:05:26,07 --> 00:05:32,53
a cockatoo that was just about the starting
of the war. We ever on the dole where i

63
00:05:32,54 --> 00:05:36,74
was on the dole. Yes i was on the dole
for about five years after the harbour

64
00:05:36,74 --> 00:05:41,57
bridge. You know work at
all. Well we're still

65
00:05:41,57 --> 00:05:48,54
a little bit of weak relief work. I was
married at the time. And i used to get two

66
00:05:48,54 --> 00:05:54,81
weeks out of every five work. So
what was sort of work. Was it.

67
00:05:55,40 --> 00:06:00,99
It was all around road work. Did you get
paid for that it is just pay you were the

68
00:06:00,99 --> 00:06:07,00
girl who we got paid. We're going to weekly
pay at that time for one week was about

69
00:06:08,12 --> 00:06:13,75
£3 £3 ten. How did that compare with what
you were paid at the workshops are no

70
00:06:13,75 --> 00:06:20,67
comparison at all but we only got
that those two weeks in five weeks.

71
00:06:20,69 --> 00:06:24,76
And then you won coupons in the weeks where
you know that was once your work and

72
00:06:24,76 --> 00:06:29,11
you don't get coupons. So what did you get
then when once you were here just got

73
00:06:29,11 --> 00:06:34,75
nothing else other than what the working
got material £3 10s about £7 for five

74
00:06:34,75 --> 00:06:41,64
weeks. That's pretty hard. Honey. Least you
had some cash in your pocket to pay the

75
00:06:41,64 --> 00:06:45,26
rent. Whereas if you were on coupons
you had nothing to pay the rent. It's

76
00:06:45,26 --> 00:06:51,74
a fact that. Did you have any children.
You're married barrett i. Well halfway

77
00:06:52,54 --> 00:06:56,66
through that five year period
that i was on the dow. We had

78
00:06:56,66 --> 00:07:00,16
a daughter hess how do
you get by and he's in

79
00:07:00,16 --> 00:07:06,96
a harder as well as well on the five weeks
i was looking for work and i used to

80
00:07:06,96 --> 00:07:09,40
pick up a couple of hours
round the shipyards is

81
00:07:11,97 --> 00:07:17,05
a bit of painting and talking and
such but there was no no work in

82
00:07:17,05 --> 00:07:21,55
a metal trade at all. I work in the metal
trade we used to go down to mulch dark

83
00:07:21,55 --> 00:07:24,29
and terrible i'm there seven o'clock of

84
00:07:24,29 --> 00:07:30,98
a morning. Bed be anything from 500
to 800 people waiting for might be

85
00:07:30,98 --> 00:07:36,25
five or six jobs and then i was home have

86
00:07:36,26 --> 00:07:42,84
a little ange out again for the afternoon
picking up somewhere else. Towing the

87
00:07:42,84 --> 00:07:49,03
line you know on. And all the metal work
jobs which is the same as that i know the

88
00:07:49,03 --> 00:07:52,16
wharfies jobs were like that was the metal
work jobs like that all the way through

89
00:07:52,16 --> 00:07:58,68
. Yes better work was all the way through
the same the only jobs as i say on at

90
00:07:58,68 --> 00:08:02,50
that time was the harbour bridge when the
harbour bridge finished for the metal

91
00:08:02,50 --> 00:08:09,03
trades. Who was just nothing about shipping
ships weren't being built. They didn't

92
00:08:09,03 --> 00:08:14,16
start building ships until or did you get
married. Well while you were working at

93
00:08:14,16 --> 00:08:19,98
the bridge. Yes yes i got married because
i just finished the bridge when i got

94
00:08:19,98 --> 00:08:24,89
married. Did you might give
your clock and. I think as

95
00:08:24,89 --> 00:08:28,98
a few of them got who got married during
the building of the bridge. So they got to

96
00:08:28,98 --> 00:08:29,71
give them the clock or

97
00:08:29,71 --> 00:08:33,57
a subscription was taken out for them but
if you left. Well that was different that

98
00:08:33,57 --> 00:08:40,46
you can remember. Any other sort of
incidents that stick out in your mind while

99
00:08:40,46 --> 00:08:46,77
you were working there. You know.
Things were hard as i said before

100
00:08:48,32 --> 00:08:48,86
when you was

101
00:08:48,86 --> 00:08:55,10
a boy and working there. You was under
the control of the boilermaker and

102
00:08:56,10 --> 00:08:56,24
it was

103
00:08:56,24 --> 00:09:03,31
a hard job and i all hard men and
sometimes. If you were putting

104
00:09:03,32 --> 00:09:09,87
a rivet in the hole and you hit it and you
hit didn't hit it square. The rebel bend

105
00:09:10,68 --> 00:09:16,70
and have to come out and it was stop and
production. And the boilermakers start

106
00:09:17,47 --> 00:09:23,20
racing on you and you'd roust back
and actually in a clip of a year or

107
00:09:23,21 --> 00:09:29,11
a kick in the pants and did you have to
make the tea as well now we didn't have to

108
00:09:29,11 --> 00:09:36,03
make the tea. Was there any smoke i do
you member. I don't think there was

109
00:09:37,15 --> 00:09:41,37
a cut. Remember. Do you ma'am. Where did
you live that you member going to work. I

110
00:09:41,37 --> 00:09:47,94
went to work. I lived in balmain at the
time and i live down there right down

111
00:09:47,94 --> 00:09:54,52
a birch grove way. I separate work
from walk from birch grove down

112
00:09:55,56 --> 00:09:58,51
to the moat stock wharf and catch

113
00:09:58,51 --> 00:10:04,01
a ferry across to the workshops
that is where luna park is down

114
00:10:05,69 --> 00:10:12,65
but coming home. I come home here
first on day shift the same way back

115
00:10:12,66 --> 00:10:18,77
to march street and walk home. If i was on
afternoon shift. I could only go to work

116
00:10:18,77 --> 00:10:24,37
. In our afternoon i start
to catch a bus catch

117
00:10:24,37 --> 00:10:29,16
a ferry to secular quay and right round to

118
00:10:30,59 --> 00:10:31,31
a birch square with

119
00:10:31,31 --> 00:10:35,64
a tram which are about three quarters of
an hour. So knocking off at eleven o'clock

120
00:10:35,64 --> 00:10:40,78
. You know about one o'clock. If you're
lucky and boys are on the afternoon shift

121
00:10:40,78 --> 00:10:45,82
to boys shortly after shift
to yes we've made it

122
00:10:45,82 --> 00:10:51,93
a long day and. It was three o'clock till
eleven o'clock you shift. But to get

123
00:10:51,93 --> 00:10:58,76
there at three o'clock you definitely would
hope to accra. That if you as well as

124
00:10:58,76 --> 00:10:59,48
as

125
00:10:59,48 --> 00:11:02,65
a matter of whether you had the money if
you if you're fair. You didn't indulge in

126
00:11:02,65 --> 00:11:08,51
the crown and anchor of the lunchtime with
the other side. Charlie rangel me ever

127
00:11:08,51 --> 00:11:13,18
losing his money on the on the the crown
and anchor and having the scale of on the

128
00:11:13,18 --> 00:11:19,42
trail. A lot of them did but i never found
the money so proud of all that by it.

129
00:11:21,16 --> 00:11:25,72
Do you. Well course you weren't married
but nonetheless your parents weren't

130
00:11:25,72 --> 00:11:32,61
exactly you father did he did he have
work at that time or not. My father

131
00:11:33,47 --> 00:11:39,75
he worked on the harbour bridge. But on
the approaches. He worked on the north

132
00:11:39,75 --> 00:11:45,62
sydney sorrowed more until
it came to the pilings

133
00:11:46,60 --> 00:11:53,31
and he left there and went to the shipyards
pretty he was there or way before the

134
00:11:53,31 --> 00:11:58,17
bridge the arch work was started and was
he finished up when the artwork started.

135
00:11:58,77 --> 00:12:02,100
He was a yes it finished up at the
harbour bridge but he'd been working to

136
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:09,91
a shipyard. So he still had work
harder did. Yes. How did it go after

137
00:12:09,91 --> 00:12:11,98
that after the bridge was finished was

138
00:12:11,98 --> 00:12:18,74
a did he still have work. You know i thought
i had to go into state. He went down

139
00:12:18,74 --> 00:12:24,52
to work on the murray bridge between the
murray bridge down there. He was down

140
00:12:24,52 --> 00:12:27,100
there for about three or four years. Well
as you were trying to make ends meet.

141
00:12:28,17 --> 00:12:34,77
Round sydney. That's right. They weren't
easy terms so they you know in out

142
00:12:35,55 --> 00:12:41,49
. Time that time were very hard to
see the depression started about

143
00:12:41,50 --> 00:12:48,33
1928 the depression started with
the timber workers timber work

144
00:12:48,33 --> 00:12:52,70
started. And now timber supplied all

145
00:12:52,70 --> 00:12:56,01
a housing finished they couldn't tell how
has it couldn't put roofs on it couldn't

146
00:12:56,01 --> 00:13:00,92
read floors in so all the
housing finished. So that left

147
00:13:00,92 --> 00:13:03,23
a shortage in the building industry for

148
00:13:03,23 --> 00:13:10,84
a start. Yes.

149
00:13:10,86 --> 00:13:16,50
What do you what do you think about the
proposal to add lanes to the bridge now i

150
00:13:16,51 --> 00:13:19,99
don't think it would be a
good idea. I think there is

151
00:13:19,99 --> 00:13:25,82
a nuff traffic going over it now. Not
the bridge couldn't hold the traffic.

152
00:13:26,96 --> 00:13:32,20
But where were the traffic go where are
you going to cross the bridge who still

153
00:13:32,20 --> 00:13:38,69
have to go on the existent roadways. I think
the bridge should go down further down

154
00:13:38,69 --> 00:13:45,65
the harbour george the heads.
What's your thoughts now about the

155
00:13:45,65 --> 00:13:50,68
bridge. Having worked on it and fifty years
later. Do you work at what he what do

156
00:13:50,68 --> 00:13:55,27
you think of now looking back at it. I
think it'll be there another fifty years

157
00:13:56,02 --> 00:14:01,18
easy. Year ever having to be well made.
Remember everything being accurate.

158
00:14:01,45 --> 00:14:08,41
Everything was accurate where they
are building up all be the girders

159
00:14:09,78 --> 00:14:15,25
all the holes were drilled they weren't
punched or anything they were all assembled

160
00:14:16,11 --> 00:14:22,91
and drilled in the position. So all
the holes were clear clean. They were

161
00:14:22,91 --> 00:14:24,04
pout and

162
00:14:24,05 --> 00:14:29,67
a pin and an open how so. The plates
couldn't move and the holes were always hey

163
00:14:29,67 --> 00:14:36,00
was clean the rivets were going in them
would fill up and there'd be no movement in

164
00:14:36,00 --> 00:14:40,59
them plates. Have you seen jobs that
was good. Since i've never seen

165
00:14:40,59 --> 00:14:42,69
a job organized i have

166
00:14:42,69 --> 00:14:47,39
a bridge. What do you attribute that to
the doorman long of the public works

167
00:14:47,39 --> 00:14:51,98
a world. Well dorm along first because
they had experience and build

168
00:14:51,98 --> 00:14:58,89
a bridge building. But we had the
experience here but nearly all the

169
00:14:58,89 --> 00:15:05,24
fellows that worked on my harbor bridge
came from the old country. They were

170
00:15:05,24 --> 00:15:12,01
scotchman they were high richmond you
name it they were there and they all had

171
00:15:12,01 --> 00:15:17,33
experience before they came over and not
many of them were brought over by doormen

172
00:15:17,33 --> 00:15:18,56
long where they now

173
00:15:18,56 --> 00:15:23,78
a lot of them came over. When australia
was being settled there was the oil

174
00:15:23,78 --> 00:15:29,06
companies they came over here because there
was work building the big storage tanks

175
00:15:29,06 --> 00:15:36,06
and everything and ship building was
booming at the start and they had

176
00:15:36,06 --> 00:15:42,94
a slump and then all that labour was ready
to go on the harbour bridge. Do you

177
00:15:42,94 --> 00:15:48,26
remember the bosses in the workshop do you
remember who was in charge of the worker

178
00:15:48,26 --> 00:15:54,100
. I i know their immediate
boss was david on about him.

179
00:15:56,61 --> 00:16:02,98
There was jim martin. I'm
not sure the other bosses

180
00:16:02,98 --> 00:16:08,10
remember alf muttered. Yes i remember our
mothers. But what did he wear what sort

181
00:16:08,10 --> 00:16:13,86
of clothes he wear or couldn't hurt. I
just ask because. Because jack grew once

182
00:16:13,86 --> 00:16:18,82

of a blue serge suit knitted tie and

183
00:16:18,82 --> 00:16:25,62
