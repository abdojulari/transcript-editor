1
00:00:15,49 --> 00:00:18,25
And for toilets people immediately
just because in the ground.

2
00:00:18,42 --> 00:00:21,53
It's very difficult to get
people once they start doing

3
00:00:21,53 --> 00:00:24,42
that to something which
is more appropriate.

4
00:00:25,50 --> 00:00:29,40
And so they they drive bomb cars and
they use holes in the ground for toilets

5
00:00:29,40 --> 00:00:33,94
and carry water up from the creek in
buckets and that once people achieve

6
00:00:33,94 --> 00:00:35,50
that bottom.

7
00:00:36,99 --> 00:00:50,54
Level of servicing then they just sort
of see the need to progress again.

8
00:00:51,64 --> 00:00:56,62
That's exactly what happens a circle of
poverty and the lack of servicing means

9
00:00:56,62 --> 00:00:57,59
that all people time

10
00:00:57,59 --> 00:01:04,76
and effort is used up keeping
inefficient services going rather than.

11
00:01:04,78 --> 00:01:08,97
Possibly collectivizing and
making more efficiency.

12
00:01:10,49 --> 00:01:13,08
And it can be a actively destructive.

13
00:01:14,33 --> 00:01:18,03
The lack of organization of services for
example as one part in the property where

14
00:01:18,03 --> 00:01:23,07
there are six water pipes all tied
together in a big bundle all running to

15
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:30,02
different places because no one trusts
to share a pipe with anyone else with

16
00:01:30,03 --> 00:01:32,04
good reason. Historically.

17
00:01:32,80 --> 00:01:33,96
Because the quickest

18
00:01:33,96 --> 00:01:37,01
and easiest way of getting getting back at
your neighbour for any reason is to cut

19
00:01:37,01 --> 00:01:39,71
their water off. And that courses

20
00:01:39,71 --> 00:01:46,72
and reaction in somebody has had their
water cut off which is fire lines.

21
00:01:47,69 --> 00:01:49,61
So that was in the sense

22
00:01:51,14 --> 00:01:57,11
that yes i decided there's no way
that we're going to do any a fish

23
00:01:57,11 --> 00:02:02,99
and implementation of soft
serve. I think technology. Via.

24
00:02:03,38 --> 00:02:08,25
Communities. The didn't seem to be the
degree of trust or resolve or capital

25
00:02:10,04 --> 00:02:10,49
and as well as

26
00:02:10,49 --> 00:02:13,48
that there wasn't the quality of the gear
there either had to build it yourself

27
00:02:14,25 --> 00:02:15,31
and it always looked back yard

28
00:02:15,31 --> 00:02:19,74
and people never trusted it whereas you
had to pay for commercial stuff which is

29
00:02:19,74 --> 00:02:21,55
vastly overpriced.

30
00:02:22,48 --> 00:02:23,15
So we decided

31
00:02:23,15 --> 00:02:27,89
that the real bottleneck in the implementation
of soft earth friendly technology

32
00:02:27,89 --> 00:02:32,43
was the commercial sector. So we decided
well if you can't beat them join them.

33
00:02:33,57 --> 00:02:37,22
And we set up a company to both
resell at reasonable prices.

34
00:02:37,78 --> 00:02:42,96
And also to manufacture. What i'd
call technological missing links.

35
00:02:42,98 --> 00:02:47,67
Key things which you need to make a
system operate and which you can't buy.

36
00:02:48,76 --> 00:02:54,95
And also to get purchasing power because
it's a very strange world out there in the

37
00:02:54,95 --> 00:02:58,58
market. We think that a free market and
anyone's money is as good as anyone else

38
00:02:58,58 --> 00:02:59,96
but it doesn't work like that.

39
00:03:01,50 --> 00:03:04,94
Refusal to deal as almost
the rule not the exception

40
00:03:04,94 --> 00:03:10,09
when you come to to buying technological
things and with the title

41
00:03:10,09 --> 00:03:13,28
and respectable incorporation of
right about power company we found

42
00:03:13,28 --> 00:03:15,16
that we had a lot more
credibility and buying power.

43
00:03:15,46 --> 00:03:19,24
Because suddenly by a lot
cheaper. And if you get.

44
00:03:21,29 --> 00:03:22,83
Get people to sell us things
and give us information

45
00:03:22,83 --> 00:03:27,69
that as individual operators was
impossible. Because us as backyard.

46
00:03:27,83 --> 00:03:31,26
Hippy inventors you've got absolutely
no status in this community.

47
00:03:32,64 --> 00:03:37,35
Once you've got a business card people
treat you like you're on the same planet.

48
00:03:37,37 --> 00:03:39,28
And that was the main
reason that we did it.

49
00:03:40,29 --> 00:03:44,88
And it worked amazingly well it's like these
two societies an invisible one within

50
00:03:44,88 --> 00:03:49,41
the big one an invisible one within the
big one as the people with business clout

51
00:03:50,31 --> 00:03:56,41
with money was respectability who are
financially operating as against the dropouts

52
00:03:56,41 --> 00:03:59,69
inverted commas people who
are considered as nobody's.

53
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,04
Because they haven't got enough
money or political power.

54
00:04:07,07 --> 00:04:10,00
To rejoin get over them.

55
00:04:10,02 --> 00:04:14,62
The progressive if you invented something.

56
00:04:17,11 --> 00:04:20,09
Basic it was with retailing
retailing kicked it all off.

57
00:04:20,26 --> 00:04:25,97
There'd been a few people running market
stalls. Someone from this co-op and and.

58
00:04:26,19 --> 00:04:28,96
Peter from webster's creek and he
wasn't actually living there then.

59
00:04:29,09 --> 00:04:33,29
But there were people staying during
stalls selling things like efficient light

60
00:04:33,29 --> 00:04:38,82
bulbs torches. Bits of
appropriate technology at that.

61
00:04:38,89 --> 00:04:43,28
The markets particularly the china
market which is an amazing.

62
00:04:43,30 --> 00:04:46,94
Focus of entrepreneurship and.

63
00:04:46,95 --> 00:04:50,24
Appropriate technology was one of
the things that went along with

64
00:04:50,24 --> 00:04:53,27
that market format. And that's
what started the idea of buying

65
00:04:53,27 --> 00:04:59,64
and selling as a business. And peter had
been doing that and david been doing that.

66
00:05:01,39 --> 00:05:05,61
And caroline he registered a business sun
source which was doing the same thing she

67
00:05:05,61 --> 00:05:08,40
was buying and selling solar
panels and this buying

68
00:05:08,40 --> 00:05:14,43
and selling as a way of generating money
and getting contacts had an obvious.

69
00:05:14,45 --> 00:05:19,53
Escalation which was to set up a
company and that's what happened.

70
00:05:19,55 --> 00:05:24,04
In.

71
00:05:24,06 --> 00:05:27,90
Yeah.

72
00:05:27,92 --> 00:05:32,39
The second year i think i actually built
the first water well which worked.

73
00:05:32,41 --> 00:05:37,82
Didn't work very well because it's cheap
is to keep wearing out drive belts.

74
00:05:37,84 --> 00:05:42,47
That actually produced a useful
amount of electricity that it.

75
00:05:42,49 --> 00:05:48,23
Actually sat in the creek and used to
get wet the drive belt used to slip.

76
00:05:48,68 --> 00:05:52,89
And the thing used to wear out. And also
i had big political problems with it.

77
00:05:53,90 --> 00:06:00,33
Because. There was a an anti-technology
feeling here a luddite mentality. And.

78
00:06:00,93 --> 00:06:06,09
I was also. I tried to go through
the correct processes of getting.

79
00:06:06,43 --> 00:06:09,34
Co-operative endorsement
of these energy project.

80
00:06:10,59 --> 00:06:15,87
But while i while i actually got that
endorsement for most of the things i did.

81
00:06:16,90 --> 00:06:17,84
I actually raised a flag

82
00:06:18,73 --> 00:06:23,52
and attracted attention from luddite
minorities actually stoned broke interfered

83
00:06:23,52 --> 00:06:26,47
with and destroyed a lot of the
early projects which i put together

84
00:06:28,15 --> 00:06:33,44
and they saw it as an interference
with the spirits of the creek. So.

85
00:06:33,45 --> 00:06:36,44
I'd lot of trouble for
the first few years.

86
00:06:36,46 --> 00:06:38,91
Eventually i i learnt my lesson

87
00:06:38,91 --> 00:06:44,01
and stopped going through the correct
political processes because they.

88
00:06:44,02 --> 00:06:46,92
They got in the way and they drew fire.

89
00:06:46,93 --> 00:06:50,33
It's as if greenies have got this
mindset once something becomes.

90
00:06:50,97 --> 00:06:54,93
Media worthy then it's protest worthy

91
00:06:56,15 --> 00:06:59,11
and whether it's in the newspaper an issue

92
00:06:59,11 --> 00:07:04,80
or whether it's in the local co-operative
tribal meetings an issue is still draws

93
00:07:04,80 --> 00:07:07,73
fire and you get a protest movement
mobilizing for its own sake

94
00:07:08,77 --> 00:07:13,09
and most of the people involved in these
things have got minimal understanding they

95
00:07:13,10 --> 00:07:16,67
tend to be very stupid reactive
people and so i was up against

96
00:07:16,67 --> 00:07:23,85
that the most silly extreme group of greenies
do it as as a way of self-empowerment.

97
00:07:24,83 --> 00:07:28,44
And basically just against everything
on principle and then they turn around

98
00:07:28,44 --> 00:07:30,00
and act as total hypocrites

99
00:07:30,00 --> 00:07:34,64
when they've got to use some of the
mainstream technology for their own comfort.

100
00:07:35,46 --> 00:07:35,78
Anyway.

101
00:07:36,04 --> 00:07:40,35
I won't bitch about the extreme greenies
in the early days of this co-operative it

102
00:07:40,35 --> 00:07:42,41
was it was very irrational
and very emotional.

103
00:07:42,46 --> 00:07:46,90
And my first big technology success
actually did without telling anyone.

104
00:07:48,28 --> 00:07:50,00
With my own money and my own initiative.

105
00:07:50,40 --> 00:07:53,05
I just went and bought a
great pole steel cable.

106
00:07:53,99 --> 00:07:58,35
Strung it up the cliff put an electric
motor on the top and created the first.

107
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,68
Powered transport system in the whole
place which is still working to this date

108
00:08:04,46 --> 00:08:09,40
which i think is 18 years later i think
that that's an amazing achievement and

109
00:08:09,41 --> 00:08:09,88
that means

110
00:08:09,88 --> 00:08:13,95
that i can live a long list my neighboring
four houses without any road access.

111
00:08:14,77 --> 00:08:17,74
We just have a steel cable
going up a 200 foot cliff.

112
00:08:17,75 --> 00:08:24,28
It's been a very appropriate piece
of technology that still cable.

113
00:08:24,30 --> 00:08:28,48
I moved early into electricity
systems because i was both ideology

114
00:08:28,48 --> 00:08:32,42
that we didn't want to connect
to mine more up and it was so.

115
00:08:32,43 --> 00:08:37,82
Legalities we didn't want to tract yet
another government authority to us.

116
00:08:39,20 --> 00:08:41,99
And we want to prove that
alternatives were possible.

117
00:08:42,60 --> 00:08:46,21
So i built two more water wells
before one of actually worked

118
00:08:47,40 --> 00:08:51,26
and it actually ran for five years before
it got devastated an enormous flood.

119
00:08:51,63 --> 00:08:56,49
The will itself didn't get broken
but the dam across the creek did.

120
00:08:56,51 --> 00:08:59,79
So there was limited success
with water powered machines at

121
00:08:59,79 --> 00:09:04,33
that stage little bit later i put
up a recycled wind when mill

122
00:09:05,36 --> 00:09:09,21
and that's still working.

123
00:09:09,23 --> 00:09:13,80
So there's a bit of sporadic one
off successes with energy projects

124
00:09:15,00 --> 00:09:15,63
but i could see

125
00:09:15,63 --> 00:09:19,02
that my life was going to end before
many more one offs were completed.

126
00:09:19,12 --> 00:09:22,34
So i thought that getting
commercial and getting big

127
00:09:22,34 --> 00:09:26,86
and getting mass production was the
only way to have any real major impact.

128
00:09:26,88 --> 00:09:32,60
Of water world and. The
great lakes and. Yes.

129
00:09:32,61 --> 00:09:36,03
What's the same thing. So.

130
00:09:36,05 --> 00:09:40,03
We basically just did in a nicer more
commercial way what we'd already proved

131
00:09:40,03 --> 00:09:46,42
worked. Trying to get.

132
00:09:47,23 --> 00:09:51,27
It and went on. A commercial. Yes.

133
00:09:51,81 --> 00:09:55,94
And sold.

134
00:09:55,96 --> 00:09:59,64
Oh we did some interesting experiment
asian with different sorts of generators.

135
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,94
And we actually did that
fundamental research

136
00:10:05,08 --> 00:10:08,38
that was necessary to make these things
work better than the competition.

137
00:10:09,62 --> 00:10:11,52
And we stood we started with no money

138
00:10:12,26 --> 00:10:17,27
and with no preconceptions as a result
got to a different type of design which

139
00:10:17,28 --> 00:10:21,51
works better in smaller sizes
than anything on the market.

140
00:10:22,30 --> 00:10:25,37
Tells me how.

141
00:10:27,03 --> 00:10:27,61
I don't magic

142
00:10:27,61 --> 00:10:37,01
or idea of living it closer to
nature without interfering with it.

143
00:10:37,03 --> 00:10:40,63
I'd read african genesis by adria
like the i developing in forests.

144
00:10:40,90 --> 00:10:45,55
I hated lawnmower style. The thing i
detested most about the suburban nightmare.

145
00:10:46,75 --> 00:10:49,83
So i pledged i would build a house
somewhere where i did not have to have a

146
00:10:49,83 --> 00:10:51,54
lawnmower.

147
00:10:51,56 --> 00:10:57,64
So i actually picked a piece of totally
standard ordinary eucalypt forest.

148
00:10:59,22 --> 00:11:02,28
Which had reasonable access.
Once i put this cable up.

149
00:11:02,30 --> 00:11:06,79
I didn't have to fight any territorial
wars with anyone else who wanted

150
00:11:06,79 --> 00:11:10,43
that the land or the water or the
the access or something like that.

151
00:11:10,58 --> 00:11:14,60
So it's a totally ordinary anonymous site
in the middle of an australian mountain

152
00:11:14,60 --> 00:11:20,63
range. And i built a house there. The
house was defined for a much by the site.

153
00:11:20,66 --> 00:11:26,07
It had to be fireproof had to be proof
against falling timber. It had to be cheap.

154
00:11:26,94 --> 00:11:28,05
It had to be maintenance free.

155
00:11:28,68 --> 00:11:33,64
And when i didn't have to protect that
nasty chemicals or the chainsaw so.

156
00:11:34,48 --> 00:11:36,71
The only one that fitted that
the bill perfectly was a dome.

157
00:11:37,12 --> 00:11:40,70
I'd always been interested in domes because
of the structural elegance of these

158
00:11:40,70 --> 00:11:42,42
very little materials
in a very high strength

159
00:11:43,82 --> 00:11:47,61
and one way in which we can use less of
the earth's resources the city is more

160
00:11:47,61 --> 00:11:50,77
efficient structures like
my house ways 10 tons.

161
00:11:52,01 --> 00:11:52,68
That might sound a lot

162
00:11:52,68 --> 00:11:56,64
but your average brick veneer house with a
fraction of the strength weighs about 10

163
00:11:56,64 --> 00:12:02,97
times that amount. So. Foreign
mental impact was there.

164
00:12:03,07 --> 00:12:04,10
It was measurable.

165
00:12:04,72 --> 00:12:06,06
The thing was made of cement

166
00:12:06,06 --> 00:12:08,84
and steel both have got a
definite environmental impact.

167
00:12:08,90 --> 00:12:12,54
It's not particularly bad if you
look at the life cycle impact of

168
00:12:12,54 --> 00:12:15,93
that technology and a
small amount of it used.

169
00:12:15,95 --> 00:12:19,55
So it was basically just a
demonstration way of living.

170
00:12:20,72 --> 00:12:27,42
Soft impact housing. You
know i ignored them.

171
00:12:27,52 --> 00:12:30,45
I've learnt my lesson but then don't
make waves you don't draw fire.

172
00:12:31,59 --> 00:12:36,37
So i went through all the right
moves with a cooperative.

173
00:12:36,38 --> 00:12:38,99
I even put in a picture of it
to the building inspector.

174
00:12:39,69 --> 00:12:41,32
Just the minimum application.

175
00:12:41,46 --> 00:12:44,65
I got the message back he didn't believe
in domes and that was the end of it.

176
00:12:45,59 --> 00:12:49,00
No further correspondence entered into
until seven years later they suddenly

177
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:53,34
discovered that i was loved to become legal
by dint of being an existing structure.

178
00:12:54,50 --> 00:12:57,49
So the limits of location were
about to fall on my side.

179
00:12:58,35 --> 00:13:02,21
But then we put in some more planes
and got the thing legitimized.

180
00:13:02,87 --> 00:13:06,75
And i was able to actually
thanks to paul lander.

181
00:13:06,77 --> 00:13:08,18
Passed not ordinance 70

182
00:13:08,18 --> 00:13:12,79
but structural engineering testing which
of course my house fail passed easily in

183
00:13:12,79 --> 00:13:14,55
fact i became part of the test weight.

184
00:13:14,69 --> 00:13:20,97
I stood on top of the ton of weight on the
weakest place. So that was a lot of fun.

185
00:13:21,74 --> 00:13:27,26
It was nice feeling that
slight amount of bureaucratic.

186
00:13:27,28 --> 00:13:32,36
Acceptability.

187
00:13:32,38 --> 00:13:34,70
Oh there was never an issue
that the dome was too weak.

188
00:13:34,94 --> 00:13:38,47
That would irritated me so much about
didn't 70 it was not about strength.

189
00:13:38,61 --> 00:13:39,45
It was not about appropriateness.

190
00:13:40,89 --> 00:13:45,71
It was not even about
health was about code.

191
00:13:46,70 --> 00:13:47,83
And the fact

192
00:13:47,83 --> 00:13:51,45
that you've got the option to either
get your structure passed by code

193
00:13:51,45 --> 00:13:52,84
or by engineering tests.

194
00:13:52,95 --> 00:13:59,14
I think is the way the world should be.

195
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,75
Anything. Personal life was disastrous.

196
00:14:08,13 --> 00:14:12,30
I was terribly lonely not living.

197
00:14:13,31 --> 00:14:15,00
I was living in one of
the hamlets in the place

198
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:17,82
and we worked pretty much as a
group and that together and so on.

199
00:14:21,29 --> 00:14:27,08
I became quite quite mad from sleeping
alone for too many years and.

200
00:14:27,10 --> 00:14:30,13
There's an enormous shortage of women.

201
00:14:30,15 --> 00:14:35,19
And the ones that were tended
to be attracted by people.

202
00:14:36,20 --> 00:14:38,84
With more services of course not.
That lived on top of the cliff.

203
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:42,62
So that wasn't so much. The trouble.

204
00:14:42,64 --> 00:14:46,27
It was really the conflict
between homesteaders

205
00:14:46,28 --> 00:14:48,13
and free love hippies

206
00:14:49,69 --> 00:14:56,26
and we had this both ideals side by
side literally where you get one lot of

207
00:14:56,26 --> 00:14:59,33
neighbours who would be very morally
vindictive about people are sleeping around

208
00:15:01,04 --> 00:15:04,08
and then you'd have next door people who
didn't believe in marriage in the least.

209
00:15:04,29 --> 00:15:06,96
And if you try to possessive
that was a heavy trip man

210
00:15:08,27 --> 00:15:12,82
and i believe reality is sort of
somewhere in between the two extremes.

211
00:15:13,70 --> 00:15:15,09
And i think that's where i always was.

212
00:15:16,60 --> 00:15:21,74
But i had a reputation as a terrible
philanderer which wasn't totally deserved.

213
00:15:21,76 --> 00:15:22,06
And.

214
00:15:24,60 --> 00:15:31,14
I didn't make it as one of the breeders.

215
00:15:31,93 --> 00:15:36,86
In the period when you told. Yes.

216
00:15:38,18 --> 00:15:40,67
I felt a lot of reverse
sexism in this community.

217
00:15:41,01 --> 00:15:42,84
I i don't know whether
i was totally right.

218
00:15:42,93 --> 00:15:46,50
But i certainly perceived that men were
considered as extremely expendable

219
00:15:47,21 --> 00:15:53,63
and freshen a very mercenary way
simply as house builders. You see.

220
00:15:53,65 --> 00:15:59,82
The role of a man in that utopian
community was extremely ill defined.

221
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,77
In many of the cases the women
usurped the natural roles of men.

222
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:06,56
I'm not complaining about that.

223
00:16:06,59 --> 00:16:09,58
I think it's appropriate that they
did but the women wore overalls.

224
00:16:10,03 --> 00:16:14,88
They were extremely aggressive they were
territorial they were very much interested

225
00:16:14,88 --> 00:16:15,94
in their own pecking order.

226
00:16:16,56 --> 00:16:20,38
They weren't very interested in the men's
little games men became very much.

227
00:16:20,41 --> 00:16:25,47
Also rounders and their own use as
whether they could produce food or.

228
00:16:25,49 --> 00:16:30,31
Build houses they weren't of any financial
use because women could get much more

229
00:16:30,31 --> 00:16:34,09
money for mother growing
dope or social security

230
00:16:34,09 --> 00:16:42,11
or even prostitution in a few cases so
many of no use would ever financially.

231
00:16:42,13 --> 00:16:44,75
And once they built the house.

232
00:16:44,79 --> 00:16:46,21
So usually disposed of as well

233
00:16:48,07 --> 00:16:51,81
and there's a shortage of women there are
a bit more menace as always been the case

234
00:16:51,81 --> 00:16:52,58
in the australian outback

235
00:16:54,19 --> 00:17:00,74
and a lot of the women were coming from
a situation of persecution in fact.

236
00:17:00,76 --> 00:17:02,74
I think it's a fair generalization

237
00:17:02,74 --> 00:17:06,55
that many of women who ended up
here were coming here to escape.

238
00:17:07,08 --> 00:17:09,94
Sexist oppression by men

239
00:17:10,88 --> 00:17:15,20
and men came here for idealistic
dreams of freedom and

240
00:17:15,20 --> 00:17:22,02
and utopia. Women tend to
come here to escape men and.

241
00:17:22,57 --> 00:17:29,22
I think had a miserable time because
back in suburbia. They got basically.

242
00:17:29,24 --> 00:17:35,15
Used financially by being under
the thumb of men particularly

243
00:17:35,16 --> 00:17:36,99
when they had young kids.

244
00:17:37,01 --> 00:17:40,30
They came here to get away from men and
suddenly they could have their freedom.

245
00:17:40,64 --> 00:17:42,36
But then they found the tyranny

246
00:17:42,36 --> 00:17:45,45
that they didn't have well
enough service situation so

247
00:17:45,45 --> 00:17:50,51
that they missed their cars they
missed their houses and particularly

248
00:17:50,51 --> 00:17:53,15
when you got young kids. I think
you need servicing more than ever.

249
00:17:54,21 --> 00:17:55,64
You were doing in your life.

250
00:17:56,33 --> 00:17:59,90
Suddenly all of the the middle
class values of flushed to.

251
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,37
Well it's in cars and
security and things like

252
00:18:02,37 --> 00:18:04,58
that become very important
because you've got little kids.

253
00:18:05,24 --> 00:18:07,17
And that that makes it a necessity.

254
00:18:10,37 --> 00:18:11,99
So anyway what i was getting to i guess is

255
00:18:11,99 --> 00:18:17,30
that men were seen very much as mercenary.

256
00:18:17,32 --> 00:18:22,31
Contracts and the game was.

257
00:18:22,33 --> 00:18:25,74
You build houses and fix cars and
you get to go to bed with me.

258
00:18:25,88 --> 00:18:28,27
And that was the way the
social contract worked

259
00:18:29,01 --> 00:18:33,03
and of course i'd always been a romantic
ideals to i believe in soulmates i

260
00:18:33,03 --> 00:18:38,00
believed in equality of the sexes i believed
in all the sort of lovely flower child

261
00:18:38,00 --> 00:18:40,24
sort of stuff and.

262
00:18:40,26 --> 00:18:45,98
I was extremely hurt to be taken as
purely a provider of the building

263
00:18:47,45 --> 00:18:51,80
so i did a bit of building houses and
a bit of fixing people's water pipes

264
00:18:51,80 --> 00:18:55,48
and a lot of wiring people's houses
and all sort of thing but it seemed

265
00:18:55,48 --> 00:19:02,05
that sex in return for labor
was it was unsatisfying

266
00:19:02,05 --> 00:19:02,57
emotionally.

267
00:19:07,48 --> 00:19:14,14
So not. With are not generally
deeper emotional level.

268
00:19:14,24 --> 00:19:19,10
And that wasn't my side i kept falling in
love with women was a terrible problem.

269
00:19:20,46 --> 00:19:24,41
And of course men are a nuisance
particularly if there are love with you. So.

270
00:19:25,71 --> 00:19:26,13
And when you try

271
00:19:26,13 --> 00:19:31,99
and make demands because your happiness
is totally dependent upon getting in

272
00:19:31,99 --> 00:19:33,44
someone else's bed which i think so.

273
00:19:33,45 --> 00:19:39,64
Farcical situation but that's the situation
in which most men found themselves.

274
00:19:39,65 --> 00:19:44,60
So. Just like that.

275
00:19:45,79 --> 00:19:48,58
Get falling in love with people kept.

276
00:19:48,60 --> 00:19:53,64
Sleeping alone kept feeling depressed.

277
00:19:54,98 --> 00:19:59,81
Was a cycle that went over and over
again. That the decision that.

278
00:20:01,77 --> 00:20:04,54
Did you make a decision. You
know and yes very strongly.

279
00:20:04,69 --> 00:20:07,43
That seemed like a bad joke.

280
00:20:10,60 --> 00:20:16,24
Wendy wendy to me i was after about
15 years but less than that actually

281
00:20:16,93 --> 00:20:22,04
but 12 years of this. As long
have to try out all of the.

282
00:20:22,57 --> 00:20:25,64
Life options.

283
00:20:25,66 --> 00:20:30,14
And to find a life option i
was wanted children and.

284
00:20:31,76 --> 00:20:34,76
When i discovered that i sterile anyway
that was sort of like the last bad joke.

285
00:20:36,52 --> 00:20:41,25
So it seemed like.

286
00:20:44,64 --> 00:20:45,72
A way of disposing of

287
00:20:45,72 --> 00:20:52,96
that whole problem area of my life.

288
00:20:52,98 --> 00:20:55,27
I think got dosed up and
i'm female hormones

289
00:20:57,27 --> 00:21:00,57
that work unbelievably well
i recommend it for many.

290
00:21:01,90 --> 00:21:07,53
Depressive suicidal lovesick males.

291
00:21:10,29 --> 00:21:14,83
It's worked its works for you and
you. Solve that problem. Totally.

292
00:21:15,01 --> 00:21:21,87
Yes. It was a problem for other people to.

293
00:21:22,29 --> 00:21:26,71
Quite frankly i did i thought that was their
problem. I didn't know them anything.

294
00:21:29,59 --> 00:21:30,90
I thought it was their
problem to deal with

295
00:21:30,90 --> 00:21:37,05
and it was not really a problem anyway i
thought well things quite quite funny.

296
00:21:37,07 --> 00:21:40,79
How did the people to his actions.

297
00:21:40,94 --> 00:21:42,60
Oh i get treated as mad

298
00:21:43,50 --> 00:21:47,71
but then most people are treated as a
man who live here anyway so what does

299
00:21:47,71 --> 00:21:51,81
that mean. It did.

300
00:21:51,90 --> 00:21:55,99
Further worsen the credibility problem.

301
00:21:56,00 --> 00:21:59,92
I felt that i always had communication
problems because i was all.

302
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:02,93
It's being shouted down by a loud mouth
people who repeated themselves 10 times

303
00:22:02,93 --> 00:22:03,58
and got they way

304
00:22:04,39 --> 00:22:07,42
that was sort of like a syndrome which had
been going ever since the beginning of

305
00:22:07,42 --> 00:22:10,89
the co-operative i couldn't
believe my media dropping status

306
00:22:10,89 --> 00:22:15,30
when i came to live untouchable
compared with being a schoolteacher.

307
00:22:15,32 --> 00:22:17,26
I wasn't particularly
authoritative as a schoolteacher

308
00:22:17,26 --> 00:22:21,18
but i got christmas at least
anyone's equal was coming here.

309
00:22:21,40 --> 00:22:24,50
I was immediately suspect because i was
from the straight science community which

310
00:22:24,50 --> 00:22:29,99
is considered as a as a demonic religion.

311
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:36,92
And i didn't ever doubt my principles of
what i call straight science my ideas of

312
00:22:36,92 --> 00:22:39,53
truth my belief structure i think
is the way they put it now

313
00:22:39,53 --> 00:22:43,14
and never been under much threat
and never and still isn't.

314
00:22:43,16 --> 00:22:46,76
And for that reason i was considered
a little bit spiritually limited.

315
00:22:46,78 --> 00:22:47,73
And very suspect

316
00:22:49,11 --> 00:22:54,10
and certainly not a accorded much
credibility in the community.

317
00:22:54,11 --> 00:22:54,85
So

318
00:22:56,03 --> 00:22:59,73
that got a bit worse with a gender change
because women tend not to have much credibility

319
00:22:59,73 --> 00:23:03,18
either particularly it comes
to cars and things like that

320
00:23:03,18 --> 00:23:09,49
that many years ago perhaps.

321
00:23:11,02 --> 00:23:16,06
You know. It's very male dominated it
tends to involve male egos very heavily

322
00:23:17,75 --> 00:23:20,75
and it's considered as mad

323
00:23:20,75 --> 00:23:26,43
and lacking in credibility anyway because
people almost worship mains power.

324
00:23:27,41 --> 00:23:34,40
Mains water the utility authority is
very close to the the image of male

325
00:23:34,40 --> 00:23:37,08
authority in our in our culture.

326
00:23:37,10 --> 00:23:39,72
And anyone who doesn't believe in
those things has got to be a maniac.

327
00:23:39,93 --> 00:23:42,12
I mean peter pedal suffered a lot of this.

328
00:23:42,85 --> 00:23:46,67
He was considered
impractical people sort of.

329
00:23:46,68 --> 00:23:50,16
People actually accept him quite well
because he's so obviously eccentric

330
00:23:50,16 --> 00:23:52,85
that it's not a threat that
he disagrees with them.

331
00:23:54,59 --> 00:23:57,39
So in that way he was much more
successful at putting his message across

332
00:23:57,39 --> 00:23:59,27
that me he was a bit more of a sort of a.

333
00:24:00,51 --> 00:24:04,24
A denying revolutionist or
saying this is morally wrong

334
00:24:04,24 --> 00:24:08,89
and stupid the way things are done with
he wouldn't be nearly so confront tatian

335
00:24:08,89 --> 00:24:13,17
was that the goods there except peter
pedals having silly ideas like

336
00:24:13,17 --> 00:24:17,24
that one should. Good pedal to raise
power to run a television set.

337
00:24:17,35 --> 00:24:18,73
People can laugh at it.

338
00:24:18,78 --> 00:24:20,22
People can treat him as a joke and for

339
00:24:20,22 --> 00:24:26,84
that reason is not as confronting i was
much less tactful i think than peter

340
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:32,35
and people didn't want to hear what i
had to tell them so i always had this

341
00:24:32,35 --> 00:24:38,95
credibility problem. To
have you become more.

342
00:24:40,11 --> 00:24:43,94
I've learned about a few things i've become
very cynical about women's motivation

343
00:24:43,94 --> 00:24:48,84
in love affairs but then i also
don't hold it against them.

344
00:24:49,92 --> 00:24:53,42
I think that it just means a very different
thing to a woman and man to be in love.

345
00:24:55,65 --> 00:24:59,71
And. I think. The naive idea that there's
no difference between the sexes.

346
00:25:01,01 --> 00:25:05,08
That was around in the sixties and
seventies the same proved wrong.

347
00:25:05,10 --> 00:25:12,79
Is an enormous difference between
the sexes in lots of things.

348
00:25:14,23 --> 00:25:19,14
Most. Well and i know
women are coming from.

349
00:25:21,91 --> 00:25:26,49
And also know a lot more about what women
are coming from too because i have become

350
00:25:26,49 --> 00:25:31,21
one in many ways.

351
00:25:31,22 --> 00:25:34,97
And. Always.

352
00:25:35,91 --> 00:25:39,43
Reclusive but yes i changed sexual
partners as well as gender.

353
00:25:40,57 --> 00:25:53,99
I noticed most people don't know.

354
00:25:55,52 --> 00:25:59,56
In the history of tangible.

355
00:26:00,93 --> 00:26:04,61
It was an amazing social experiment.
And it's still going on.

356
00:26:07,54 --> 00:26:08,81
And.

357
00:26:09,97 --> 00:26:17,33
I think money is the key thing which now
turns out to be central to the whole issue.

358
00:26:17,34 --> 00:26:20,20
Incredible damage was done to
our coalition as a community.

359
00:26:20,89 --> 00:26:25,41
By money as in drug money

360
00:26:26,19 --> 00:26:30,43
and in social security money was paid in
the way which it could be most destructive

361
00:26:30,43 --> 00:26:32,99
to community spirit.

362
00:26:33,00 --> 00:26:36,54
I'm a little bit vicious about the
department of social insecurity on

363
00:26:36,54 --> 00:26:41,00
that one the way in which they handed out
the money was almost obviously designed

364
00:26:41,00 --> 00:26:43,18
to destroy any community based movement.

365
00:26:44,54 --> 00:26:48,22
It was given to individuals
on behalf of their kids.

366
00:26:48,26 --> 00:26:51,83
It was given to.

367
00:26:51,85 --> 00:26:58,04
Women were paid to leave men as one of
the effect of the way it's structured.

368
00:26:58,06 --> 00:27:02,45
You were paid to scam you
were only paid if you lied

369
00:27:03,89 --> 00:27:05,13
and you got.

370
00:27:06,44 --> 00:27:09,44
Continually kept in a state
of paranoia by random

371
00:27:09,44 --> 00:27:14,27
and unreasonable cut offs with a lack
of any long range contracting about the

372
00:27:14,27 --> 00:27:17,22
payment of social security so that
people didn't use it efficiently

373
00:27:17,95 --> 00:27:18,69
and couldn't use it efficiently

374
00:27:20,11 --> 00:27:24,22
and it maintained a sort of a live from
day to day my lifestyle which is absolute

375
00:27:24,22 --> 00:27:28,32
death in any planned community because
nearly everything which is productive has

376
00:27:28,32 --> 00:27:35,08
got to be kept going over a long
period. So money was very destructive.

377
00:27:36,21 --> 00:27:41,29
The effect of the drug itself was destructive
lots of people became alcoholics

378
00:27:41,29 --> 00:27:46,60
and heavy dope smokers and i think that
there are lots of psychiatric overtones

379
00:27:46,60 --> 00:27:51,41
that heavy use of marijuana which are not
being fully admitted i think at the very

380
00:27:51,41 --> 00:27:54,60
least it encourages different psychosis.

381
00:27:55,94 --> 00:27:59,94
Paranoia forgetfulness and laziness
are obvious but i think there's a.

382
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,25
Keep a things and that too. I think
this is the type of schizophrenia

383
00:28:05,25 --> 00:28:05,99
that people get

384
00:28:05,99 --> 00:28:12,78
and they've been smoking a long time.

385
00:28:14,34 --> 00:28:16,28
Children as the other enormous factor.

386
00:28:17,45 --> 00:28:21,17
We can't underestimate
how much children here.

387
00:28:21,18 --> 00:28:25,54
Partly because are living in such a close
situation extended family had enormous

388
00:28:25,54 --> 00:28:31,38
power outside society especially constructed
to protect people from children the

389
00:28:31,39 --> 00:28:38,03
put in schools that they're
bombarded with media and they're.

390
00:28:38,05 --> 00:28:39,07
The rules

391
00:28:39,07 --> 00:28:42,78
and authorities about how they're meant
to be treated here there are no rules

392
00:28:44,17 --> 00:28:48,24
and justice in the politics the people are
the loudest voices tend to get the most

393
00:28:48,24 --> 00:28:54,58
safe children because they make a lot of
noise tend to totally dominate there was

394
00:28:54,58 --> 00:28:59,17
the tail wagging the dog many family groups
were totally dominated by the needs of

395
00:28:59,17 --> 00:29:04,51
the children. And. I think to the children's
own destruction in send several cases.

396
00:29:06,23 --> 00:29:10,60
So the children get brought up totally
spoilt self-indulgent by the time

397
00:29:10,60 --> 00:29:13,52
that they're 10 the smoking
dope by the time they're 12

398
00:29:13,52 --> 00:29:15,55
that they peddling heroin on the street

399
00:29:15,55 --> 00:29:18,84
and that's the way a lot of our
children have gone. It's just too easy.

400
00:29:20,68 --> 00:29:27,21
No emphasis on constructive
behavior. You know.

401
00:29:27,89 --> 00:29:32,05
You know. You know. I've no idea.

402
00:29:32,44 --> 00:29:39,06
Like i consider myself a genuine
smaller liberal but also a moralist in

403
00:29:39,07 --> 00:29:44,39
that i think you haven't got a right to
take what you can get you've got to an

404
00:29:44,40 --> 00:29:47,56
obligation to community at
least as much as yourself.

405
00:29:47,58 --> 00:29:53,39
And i see lots of people
that are totally selfish.

406
00:29:53,41 --> 00:29:57,27
And you know this got to be a balance
between the rights of the individual in the

407
00:29:57,27 --> 00:30:01,88
community as it is a very obvious
state. There's also fundamental.

408
00:30:02,72 --> 00:30:09,46
What about the challenges of
managing and. That. In a minute now.

409
00:30:09,48 --> 00:30:14,49
You know. Things change and.

410
00:30:16,17 --> 00:30:22,26
Yes. Gradually the conventional
services are becoming more expensive.

411
00:30:22,51 --> 00:30:25,79
They're not being subsidized as much by
government and they're not being made.

412
00:30:25,91 --> 00:30:30,78
So much in the way of compulsory can
consumption because so much of western culture

413
00:30:30,78 --> 00:30:33,03
i see as compulsory can consumption.

414
00:30:33,17 --> 00:30:37,73
People don't even know how much they are
consuming after time like they're starting

415
00:30:37,73 --> 00:30:42,18
to at least measure water rates in in lismore
and you pay more if years more water.

416
00:30:42,34 --> 00:30:42,94
I mean

417
00:30:42,94 --> 00:30:47,21
that radical idea is only just now appeared
in lismore there's a funny attitude

418
00:30:47,21 --> 00:30:53,61
towards services as rights that you have
being a. White anglo-saxon protestant.

419
00:30:54,03 --> 00:30:54,70
With.

420
00:30:55,13 --> 00:30:59,60
I consider the right to consume the world's
resources is only a very modest one.

421
00:30:59,62 --> 00:31:02,42
So that feelings coming in.

422
00:31:02,43 --> 00:31:05,16
Also appropriate technology
is getting a lot cheaper

423
00:31:05,16 --> 00:31:09,80
and thanks to people like growing up our
company is getting more available service

424
00:31:09,81 --> 00:31:12,31
to back to all of those
things that consumers want.

425
00:31:14,32 --> 00:31:19,02
Solar panels for example of consistently
been getting better and cheaper so

426
00:31:19,03 --> 00:31:23,75
that now you can actually run a remote
house on solar panels. If you're careful.

427
00:31:23,77 --> 00:31:27,04
I think the biggest success this
particular property has had with energy

428
00:31:28,25 --> 00:31:31,91
and impact is that. It's not so much
to have done anything different.
