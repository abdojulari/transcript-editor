1
00:00:10,41 --> 00:00:16,35
It was sort of i was sort of out
working on minimalist thinking like

2
00:00:16,35 --> 00:00:20,32
that whole minimalist thinking i was
right into that sort of quick grab

3
00:00:20,33 --> 00:00:21,74
and macleans thing

4
00:00:21,74 --> 00:00:27,61
and i was very very media aware because i
always looked at i mean to me was a whole

5
00:00:27,61 --> 00:00:31,56
study and i got public art
and the quick grab and so

6
00:00:31,56 --> 00:00:35,20
that people make it simple
as possible. Symbols and.

7
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:40,37
Simplify symbols of it becomes easier so
because you want to get through to the

8
00:00:40,37 --> 00:00:45,01
mainstream the real the people that are
really out of it and somehow so twix them.

9
00:00:45,28 --> 00:00:51,67
I mean that was my idea. Silently
by just creating subliminal images.

10
00:00:52,62 --> 00:00:55,75
So i sort of working on
a minimalist revelant

11
00:00:55,76 --> 00:00:58,71
and so i just had a simple
quote also the whole movement.

12
00:00:58,91 --> 00:01:02,69
You know moving with a back
with a pack. Just one costume.

13
00:01:02,94 --> 00:01:07,46
Which is easy and then i had banners
and that paints and things like

14
00:01:07,46 --> 00:01:08,97
that be able to move into an area

15
00:01:09,70 --> 00:01:13,93
and go to an action just the whole theater
either work out how thick the kit

16
00:01:14,66 --> 00:01:15,49
and have to move in quickly

17
00:01:15,49 --> 00:01:19,97
and then quickly get into it
while there's this you know

18
00:01:19,97 --> 00:01:24,42
when things are happening really fast around
you just just being in it like this at

19
00:01:24,42 --> 00:01:28,11
that instant sort of getting
to sort of that sort of.

20
00:01:28,13 --> 00:01:31,22
You know getting into a phone box
and getting into superman costumes

21
00:01:31,22 --> 00:01:33,24
that sort of scenario like you.

22
00:01:33,51 --> 00:01:38,51
There you are you know like that here
appears that i felt the ethical thing.

23
00:01:38,53 --> 00:01:41,97
But that was another constructs
also the fantasy my head.

24
00:01:41,98 --> 00:01:42,36
You know like

25
00:01:42,36 --> 00:01:47,71
that sort of like these costumes like you
turn into this type image units which

26
00:01:47,71 --> 00:01:48,72
it's the piers.

27
00:01:48,75 --> 00:01:53,81
Nobody knows who it is out there or
they see is this it is this image.

28
00:01:53,83 --> 00:01:59,90
Is where you play it play
it up to them and. For the.

29
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:06,60
That costume. Then i started to work
the costume and i sort of fine writing

30
00:02:06,61 --> 00:02:10,84
and drawing so that you know
when it's picked up on camera.

31
00:02:10,98 --> 00:02:15,64
It's really clear and turn from paper
mâché didn't work too good with

32
00:02:15,64 --> 00:02:19,14
that skull thing to a gas
mask consider a ccg a smart

33
00:02:19,14 --> 00:02:25,31
and easily cranked up easy to get
and and it sort of it. Laughs and.

34
00:02:25,62 --> 00:02:29,73
And also putting the hood and that
connection with the with with air

35
00:02:29,73 --> 00:02:34,75
and breathing and pollution and so that's
symbol so as i work that idea and.

36
00:02:35,37 --> 00:02:38,21
I keep working sort of i still do it.

37
00:02:38,22 --> 00:02:43,71
I keep working the ideas and
the costume on the back had.

38
00:02:43,73 --> 00:02:47,29
And the race or in the race when i was
working thing in the piece actions.

39
00:02:47,36 --> 00:02:50,90
So my actions were were around
peace and the environment.

40
00:02:51,36 --> 00:02:57,81
One costume i could interface
and as and so i worked on that

41
00:02:57,81 --> 00:03:03,96
and and the dollar sign that i had the
dollar sign had sort of read on the edges

42
00:03:03,96 --> 00:03:08,74
and gold which was an axe it was a dollar
axe and i use that in my mind i use

43
00:03:08,74 --> 00:03:15,64
that as you know like the axons you know
like the executioner to trick you sean.

44
00:03:15,64 --> 00:03:20,40
And as the dollar was there was
the weapon and but i also use

45
00:03:20,40 --> 00:03:21,76
that to i played with it.

46
00:03:21,81 --> 00:03:26,93
You know sort of used as a gun you just
play with the in the mind sequence of just

47
00:03:26,93 --> 00:03:30,11
sort of is these props and in dance wise.

48
00:03:31,48 --> 00:03:32,44
There's multiple forms

49
00:03:33,13 --> 00:03:39,11
and then the then the towards then the the
whole even our life i've even developed

50
00:03:39,12 --> 00:03:43,56
it even further. So you've got
it's totally environmentally.

51
00:03:43,58 --> 00:03:49,46
Plugged in there doesn't even talk about
the race or in the race just says now.

52
00:03:50,36 --> 00:03:56,19
You know ecological
destruction. And. On it and.

53
00:03:56,21 --> 00:03:59,53
And then i got and i have
panels that go onto it.

54
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,25
Like can interface panels or have just a
wall writer this is the image of a wall.

55
00:04:05,26 --> 00:04:07,42
I sort of in the race or in the race.

56
00:04:07,46 --> 00:04:13,16
I say well this is just war and you
know missiles and. Barrels and drums.

57
00:04:13,45 --> 00:04:15,73
So i built up a whole travelling kit

58
00:04:15,73 --> 00:04:21,51
and a vehicle so it grew into a whole
traveling outfit show with banners

59
00:04:21,51 --> 00:04:25,59
and you know so that whole process grew

60
00:04:25,59 --> 00:04:29,36
and it came to a crescendo then i went
overseas whether just to take it in the

61
00:04:29,36 --> 00:04:32,83
larder and rocky flats and. And you know.

62
00:04:32,84 --> 00:04:36,40
Woodstock and all that
in washington and then.

63
00:04:36,77 --> 00:04:40,66
I came back recently no come back recently

64
00:04:40,66 --> 00:04:44,40
and feel sort of now
it's really the 90s era

65
00:04:44,40 --> 00:04:48,94
and this is getting down to what why i'm
here now is actually we need to really get

66
00:04:48,94 --> 00:04:50,72
down to restoration. You know.

67
00:04:51,08 --> 00:04:53,95
The planet is indeed should we know
how bad it is around the place

68
00:04:53,95 --> 00:04:58,07
and sort of freak the daylights you know
like with all the information freaks

69
00:04:58,07 --> 00:05:01,73
that they either feel we badly
need to give people ways

70
00:05:01,74 --> 00:05:04,66
or how they can restructure
their lives to heal the planet

71
00:05:05,62 --> 00:05:09,95
and we need the jobs the economy has to
be around. Healing healing the planet.

72
00:05:09,97 --> 00:05:11,59
It's very clear so

73
00:05:11,60 --> 00:05:15,02
that we've gone through all the social
experiments we don't know things that work.

74
00:05:15,05 --> 00:05:18,11
We know what's got to be done. It's not as
if we don't know what's got to be done.

75
00:05:18,29 --> 00:05:19,87
We know what's not to be done.

76
00:05:20,10 --> 00:05:24,62
You know not to pollute the you
know the nest that we we live from.

77
00:05:24,75 --> 00:05:29,57
And we've got to and we've got to stop
fighting one another in cooperating

78
00:05:30,48 --> 00:05:33,65
and on this to make this.

79
00:05:34,40 --> 00:05:40,25
World habitable for everybody.

80
00:05:42,25 --> 00:05:42,60
That that is.

81
00:05:43,09 --> 00:05:48,02
Well that's what the great one of the
green movement in general is this the is

82
00:05:48,03 --> 00:05:50,15
that movement. It's it's growing more.

83
00:05:50,21 --> 00:05:54,33
I mean i'm involved with earth repair
at the moment i mean i've always been

84
00:05:54,33 --> 00:05:58,91
involved with the earth repair foundation
cause i'm frank scarf from the united

85
00:05:58,91 --> 00:05:59,89
nations day because.

86
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,49
I'm also interested in changing the symbols
of the united nations flag because

87
00:06:03,49 --> 00:06:11,08
united nations is needs drastic reforming.

88
00:06:11,09 --> 00:06:13,48
And if it needs to recognize
that we have ngos

89
00:06:14,45 --> 00:06:20,47
and we've got to have an ngo ngos not not
nation states running the show by the

90
00:06:21,22 --> 00:06:26,59
ngos as as a forum of decision
making non-government organizations

91
00:06:26,59 --> 00:06:30,46
but it be people's basic as we've got
more people moving away from governments

92
00:06:30,46 --> 00:06:32,95
and making decisions as the power brokers

93
00:06:32,95 --> 00:06:37,96
but actually things come on forums like
people in a place you know groups like

94
00:06:37,96 --> 00:06:43,21
greenpeace and communicate abroad in
friends of the earth and a whole mallee

95
00:06:43,21 --> 00:06:45,81
and that's growing more and
more it is a people's movement.

96
00:06:45,83 --> 00:06:49,56
And so those social groups coming
up from the grassroots and from.

97
00:06:49,84 --> 00:06:54,07
Different groups from different places
around where people empower themselves are

98
00:06:54,07 --> 00:06:57,63
the people for exercising
that power these decisions.

99
00:06:58,12 --> 00:07:01,94
Come out feed themselves through government
sure you have the government things

100
00:07:01,94 --> 00:07:06,69
but the ngos have to be. Listened
to and has to be a major forum.

101
00:07:06,77 --> 00:07:11,95
I mean you don't go. And it's growing more
and more say i want to see the united.

102
00:07:12,00 --> 00:07:14,95
You know. Like you know
what a nations really and

103
00:07:14,95 --> 00:07:15,76
that they're beginning to move

104
00:07:15,76 --> 00:07:19,33
that they do have certain
ngos in the united nations

105
00:07:20,10 --> 00:07:26,09
and the last earth conference the first
big first summit that was ngo organised.

106
00:07:26,62 --> 00:07:34,11
So it was a big big part for
non-government organisations now.

107
00:07:39,26 --> 00:07:43,58
Yeah that's a spiritual base is really
important because that's where we get all we

108
00:07:43,58 --> 00:07:48,68
talk. We've been involved with the
materialistic world. Right. Well the material.

109
00:07:48,69 --> 00:07:50,43
Well i'm through meditation

110
00:07:50,43 --> 00:07:54,71
and my you know my experience through
meditation sort of made me aware

111
00:07:54,71 --> 00:07:59,33
that we live in a world of illusion.
I mean i am involved allusion.

112
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:00,44
So that

113
00:08:00,44 --> 00:08:05,92
that holds the spiritual connection you
sort of grew actually being here in you

114
00:08:05,92 --> 00:08:09,11
know from my experiences i mean the whole
experience has been experience to be

115
00:08:09,11 --> 00:08:15,91
about the whole you know i actually did
these things totally out of for my

116
00:08:15,91 --> 00:08:16,15
own.

117
00:08:17,84 --> 00:08:20,69
You know like what happen inside of me you
know i think certainly brought me out.

118
00:08:20,80 --> 00:08:22,63
I mean.

119
00:08:23,50 --> 00:08:27,22
It's just a gut experience i mean i didn't
know what i was entering into it just

120
00:08:27,22 --> 00:08:31,48
these things came to me it's almost like i
was like the messengers i was sort of i

121
00:08:31,48 --> 00:08:33,24
was just part of the process

122
00:08:33,24 --> 00:08:35,31
and sort of linking up with
other people in this process

123
00:08:36,38 --> 00:08:39,23
and this is there's a whole lot
of stuff written about in spirit.

124
00:08:39,25 --> 00:08:42,85
I was sort of looked at it. I mean
it's the shambala warrior type race

125
00:08:42,85 --> 00:08:46,50
and the warrior rainbow
warriors and things like that.

126
00:08:46,63 --> 00:08:51,32
Yeah well they're all sort of like we need
people i talk about people coming on the

127
00:08:51,32 --> 00:08:55,71
earth and rescuing the
situation from the dark ages.

128
00:08:56,08 --> 00:08:57,60
You know that's sort of
destroying the planet

129
00:08:57,60 --> 00:09:00,64
and it's well in swill been
written before like a sword.

130
00:09:00,74 --> 00:09:04,58
How many in sings and and you cannot
sort of i mean you look at it

131
00:09:04,58 --> 00:09:10,01
and it's there and so that that became
you know sort of like sort of joined

132
00:09:10,01 --> 00:09:14,91
that bandwagon and sort of
creating being part of that that.

133
00:09:16,30 --> 00:09:18,82
That movement in my lifestyle

134
00:09:19,84 --> 00:09:22,98
but the spiritualities from
observe ing around you

135
00:09:22,98 --> 00:09:26,10
that you know you become aware
that you connected on one thing

136
00:09:26,10 --> 00:09:27,37
and then you also that

137
00:09:28,24 --> 00:09:35,01
that you also just there's
this whole like you actually

138
00:09:35,01 --> 00:09:37,97
is right there in the here and now.

139
00:09:37,99 --> 00:09:42,15
And you're observing and you desire
to be keen sense of observation

140
00:09:42,15 --> 00:09:46,95
but it's still allusion. Because you. See
and hear things but it's not really.

141
00:09:48,02 --> 00:09:51,76
It's not tangible it's still
allusion area it's elusive.

142
00:09:51,78 --> 00:09:56,16
And so i mean i've come away of that
and saw that ask that connection

143
00:09:56,16 --> 00:09:59,53
that you become they connect that you
connect that and then the earth.

144
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,53
He's a living entity in itself you
know that's that's a living entities

145
00:10:04,33 --> 00:10:08,33
and i was at arco santiago in
that spirituality i learned

146
00:10:08,33 --> 00:10:11,97
that all matter is spirit and i see that
the paint there is actually living.

147
00:10:12,80 --> 00:10:16,57
It's what everything all matter is
and when we get down to recycling

148
00:10:16,57 --> 00:10:17,69
and all the rest of it.

149
00:10:17,73 --> 00:10:20,84
The rescue of the planet will
become that awareness that

150
00:10:20,84 --> 00:10:23,91
that everything that's made and
everything that's produced.

151
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:28,43
I mean it's farfetched thinking you might
think to some people but to me fix

152
00:10:28,43 --> 00:10:30,26
that everything is recyclable.

153
00:10:30,47 --> 00:10:35,71
Everything has a place in the universe
in this whole thing is just knowing just

154
00:10:35,71 --> 00:10:39,56
becoming aware that it is this
matter is very small matter is.

155
00:10:40,02 --> 00:10:42,84
His spirit and it's it's
it's a living entity.

156
00:10:43,42 --> 00:10:46,55
And you know when you're in that
meditation so you become aware that.

157
00:10:46,74 --> 00:10:48,76
That's your water an area.

158
00:10:50,10 --> 00:10:52,69
You know you you have your heart
when you're shitting and pissing

159
00:10:52,69 --> 00:10:56,89
and all the rest of you just realize
that you're just like another animal

160
00:10:56,89 --> 00:10:59,28
and you're an animal just like and

161
00:10:59,28 --> 00:11:02,94
but you've got to this other thing here
at the global brain thing you know a

162
00:11:02,94 --> 00:11:05,95
connection up can't put your finger
on it but there is that connection.

163
00:11:06,21 --> 00:11:09,08
I mean i travel from here to america

164
00:11:09,08 --> 00:11:11,89
and i see the same people
doing the same thing.

165
00:11:11,89 --> 00:11:16,14
The same connection i can see saying people
connect up in australia doing exactly

166
00:11:16,14 --> 00:11:17,37
the same even look alike.

167
00:11:18,19 --> 00:11:19,86
I mean i don't know why
but i don't know how

168
00:11:19,86 --> 00:11:24,57
but you can see are type images talk about
art talk without any costumes just doing

169
00:11:24,57 --> 00:11:30,16
things. Exactly the same slow global brain
you know is that connection. No answers.

170
00:11:30,20 --> 00:11:33,65
No no. I mean it's just
there. If you observe it.

171
00:11:33,70 --> 00:11:36,20
You can see it is going to
people talk about guide

172
00:11:36,20 --> 00:11:37,80
and all the rest of not
going to stand that.

173
00:11:37,93 --> 00:11:38,62
And i can say

174
00:11:38,62 --> 00:11:42,70
or it's all relevant because if you don't
then not you just go sort of squash

175
00:11:42,70 --> 00:11:47,34
everybody's like this is the way in the
only way we say you know to me i say you

176
00:11:47,34 --> 00:11:52,05
know develop your own process and
then keep keep keep keep an open mind

177
00:11:53,67 --> 00:11:56,17
and i say i'm sort of i'm sort
of right in the gaia principle.

178
00:11:56,72 --> 00:11:59,69
In that that's a living earth and.

179
00:12:00,76 --> 00:12:04,42
And then i feel that we can
hit we can heal the world.

180
00:12:05,79 --> 00:12:08,90
I mean is the healing we've just got
to be aware of what's destroying

181
00:12:08,90 --> 00:12:13,36
and really stop that and find solutions
i'm just keeping my fingers crossed.

182
00:12:13,46 --> 00:12:18,41
But if if it does go at least. I mean
it's you know goes for you personally.

183
00:12:18,82 --> 00:12:23,05
You don't it doesn't end life in general
because all matter is spirit will be the

184
00:12:23,05 --> 00:12:26,22
world will go on like the
universe will go on because.

185
00:12:26,24 --> 00:12:27,89
Plants have come and gone and so forth.

186
00:12:27,95 --> 00:12:29,82
So we can have that sort
of get away from the earth

187
00:12:29,82 --> 00:12:34,40
but at the moment i live on the
earth. I'm going to try my best.

188
00:12:34,42 --> 00:12:42,44
To to be evolved person in this time.

189
00:12:50,13 --> 00:12:55,60
Yeah it's a great useful tool. I mean it
wasn't till yeah well that mine and mine.

190
00:12:55,81 --> 00:13:00,74
The mine drugs are out of it's time
was very real. I mean that's true.

191
00:13:00,80 --> 00:13:03,03
I mean the mind drugs.

192
00:13:03,38 --> 00:13:08,79
I well i've experienced it
before queries because i was i.

193
00:13:08,98 --> 00:13:12,83
First it was i was overseas in 1960 69

194
00:13:12,83 --> 00:13:17,32
and i was in london after slammin the whole
sort of acid acid house thing in their

195
00:13:18,60 --> 00:13:24,02
school so i become aware of things and
then melbourne's artists and cause

196
00:13:24,02 --> 00:13:25,20
that sort of a changed me.

197
00:13:25,21 --> 00:13:30,18
I moved away from my my tribal connections
with the family so moved away from those

198
00:13:30,19 --> 00:13:30,95
sort of roots

199
00:13:31,64 --> 00:13:36,41
and start things sort of there's you know
you find yourself in relating to seeing

200
00:13:36,41 --> 00:13:40,90
things you seen elude talking about it's
illusionary you state your mind start

201
00:13:40,90 --> 00:13:47,29
seeing different things and it sort
of made you aware of certain senses

202
00:13:47,29 --> 00:13:49,42
and heightened senses and so forth but.

203
00:13:50,92 --> 00:13:54,08
It also became i was sort
of it was very special.

204
00:13:54,10 --> 00:13:55,73
I really realized that community

205
00:13:55,73 --> 00:13:59,36
that cultures in the past was a
part of a spiritual connection.

206
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,84
No they didn't go and just drop
pills in their mouth all the time

207
00:14:02,84 --> 00:14:03,95
and we sort of abused it.

208
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:08,16
That's where we've lost it in our western
society it's a consumerist society

209
00:14:09,07 --> 00:14:11,48
and people want to have the hit
all the time it was not made for

210
00:14:11,48 --> 00:14:17,06
that was made for special rituals and
certain people used to not want people

211
00:14:17,06 --> 00:14:21,22
and went through an initiation to
get there to be that and to use it.

212
00:14:22,37 --> 00:14:27,04
For those sort of special
events so to become aware

213
00:14:27,75 --> 00:14:30,37
but in this sort of world
we sort of moved away

214
00:14:30,37 --> 00:14:34,37
and that's sort of you know that's how it
is i mean i can't say it's good or bad.

215
00:14:34,59 --> 00:14:34,84
I say

216
00:14:34,84 --> 00:14:40,04
that it as experience is good provided
people know how to put the brakes on a gaza

217
00:14:40,04 --> 00:14:41,86
was it becomes destructive.

218
00:14:43,12 --> 00:14:49,05
Just so it has been a useful
tool and and and still well

219
00:14:49,05 --> 00:14:53,23
and i don't do it these days
but i wouldn't say that.

220
00:14:53,43 --> 00:14:58,07
You know like the door the pens on sort
of i went through a sort of lindsay camp

221
00:14:58,07 --> 00:15:03,79
idea doing be tripping on acid.
While on stage going on foot is.

222
00:15:03,81 --> 00:15:09,03
What i used to do that if the i used
to. I went through a stage of. Of.

223
00:15:09,52 --> 00:15:12,99
Tripping on stage while performing i did
all the rehearsals without all of that

224
00:15:13,74 --> 00:15:16,38
and did all my stuff in the
trip and and then i do things

225
00:15:16,38 --> 00:15:18,92
that i do things like i'll be on stage

226
00:15:18,92 --> 00:15:21,81
and i said i get an idea of getting
something i'll go off stage

227
00:15:22,51 --> 00:15:24,51
and get this thing you know
see something in the audience

228
00:15:24,51 --> 00:15:27,66
and bring it up on stage
you know the things

229
00:15:27,66 --> 00:15:33,40
that are totally freed me up because it's
just became this whole thing i was just.

230
00:15:34,47 --> 00:15:38,01
You know things were stretched out time
was stretched out there was no fear.

231
00:15:38,07 --> 00:15:41,66
You know took away all that there
was i was part of a whole carnival

232
00:15:42,45 --> 00:15:47,12
and performance when i was performing
i was i was the centre of attraction.

233
00:15:47,14 --> 00:15:50,34
The world. I was sent that with
the other people around me

234
00:15:51,51 --> 00:15:56,67
but it was very i found it very useful
in terms of my growth spiritual growth.

235
00:16:01,41 --> 00:16:05,29
Yeah well that's that's well it's
a living carnal living theatre.

236
00:16:05,92 --> 00:16:11,16
It's a main street in itself as a main
street and that's how i've been to see

237
00:16:11,16 --> 00:16:13,91
that since aquarius first
of all and paying it up.

238
00:16:13,93 --> 00:16:18,42
Was there in doing it up so that it's a
billboard for that to keep it like that.

239
00:16:18,51 --> 00:16:19,61
And so.

240
00:16:20,52 --> 00:16:25,64
So it's sort of maintain that that's a good
thing about the murals that i done is.

241
00:16:25,84 --> 00:16:27,89
It sort of keeps that link as a.

242
00:16:28,23 --> 00:16:33,19
As i see a trickle fafsa help that
part of it but the only other thing is

243
00:16:33,19 --> 00:16:36,76
that the people that come here
like theatre like people.

244
00:16:36,78 --> 00:16:39,36
Perform there they dress
up in a certain way

245
00:16:39,36 --> 00:16:43,20
and it sort of shock the different daylights
out of different people the way they

246
00:16:43,20 --> 00:16:49,49
behave but it's there because they want
to say well. This is how i feel you know.

247
00:16:49,51 --> 00:16:54,60
And. And it's just it's
it's sort of been left.

248
00:16:54,73 --> 00:16:58,77
Somehow it's been a place where
that's what i'm grateful that name

249
00:16:58,77 --> 00:17:03,32
and has been a place where people can bring
along their different ideas which are

250
00:17:03,32 --> 00:17:09,92
totally not in in line with the with
the smooth running cogs of society

251
00:17:09,92 --> 00:17:14,39
and and creates is this tension this
thing for problems to be solved

252
00:17:14,39 --> 00:17:17,11
but this is the world out
there coming to an end

253
00:17:17,11 --> 00:17:21,86
and which is a theatre a little small
little amphitheatre you know the globe

254
00:17:21,86 --> 00:17:24,35
theater that you walk into without any.

255
00:17:25,04 --> 00:17:27,43
Rehearsals you just come in
there's people to bring their.

256
00:17:27,83 --> 00:17:30,06
Their particular being

257
00:17:31,17 --> 00:17:38,94
and perform it in different ways.

258
00:17:39,82 --> 00:17:43,56
Yeah that was just carries
on. Yeah carries on.

259
00:17:44,53 --> 00:17:50,83
You know what that it carries on and.
Yeah. When you have you just look around.

260
00:17:51,27 --> 00:17:54,38
It's the billboard door
boards all kinds of things

261
00:17:54,38 --> 00:17:58,24
that are happening around the place for
one thing it's a billboard limit is a

262
00:17:58,24 --> 00:18:02,36
billboard as a. As well as a.

263
00:18:02,38 --> 00:18:10,00
Big forum controversial forum of new ideas
which is made itself into mainstream.

264
00:18:10,01 --> 00:18:14,92
And next week we've got the eco conference
and i think i tourism as establish

265
00:18:14,92 --> 00:18:17,32
that identity and what an
indian is and hopefully.

266
00:18:17,89 --> 00:18:21,73
I mean it's whatever the decision is
going to be made liminal still be

267
00:18:21,73 --> 00:18:26,33
that because that's how it's
perceived outside. Anyway.

268
00:18:26,40 --> 00:18:29,96
People are aware of what it
is the artistic creative

269
00:18:31,03 --> 00:18:34,33
and spiritual.

270
00:18:35,11 --> 00:18:36,92
Shamans in the world
they know what it means

271
00:18:36,92 --> 00:18:42,86
and if we're the ones who have been
here they just say this is great. Yes.

272
00:18:42,93 --> 00:18:45,78
If you tune into a kitchen
into that energy.

273
00:18:46,11 --> 00:18:52,14
It's there for others it's a total dismal.

274
00:18:52,16 --> 00:18:54,45
That but we've got to really
try and make people aware

275
00:18:54,45 --> 00:18:59,00
that it's it's really it's it's it's just
one place in the world which is very

276
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:04,14
important for the world the way it is
so real gem and got to be grateful

277
00:19:04,14 --> 00:19:05,54
that we had a aquarius festival.

278
00:19:06,11 --> 00:19:11,80
And we need to celebrate it which is sort
of just to bring out all the. What it.

279
00:19:12,21 --> 00:19:16,36
You know what it. You know what it did
and house developed up to now and just

280
00:19:16,36 --> 00:19:18,00
that whole culture and
what we are developing

281
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:28,78
and our celebration is what we're
developing towards 2010 the 21st.

282
00:19:28,79 --> 00:19:34,11
Well might. My hope for the fear
that that named and becomes.

283
00:19:34,13 --> 00:19:37,96
Well in the main street. I'd
like to see turn into a more.

284
00:19:37,98 --> 00:19:40,16
And and the traffic redirected out.

285
00:19:40,33 --> 00:19:46,00
Just on the physical level like we
do get funding to do things. How.

286
00:19:46,12 --> 00:19:51,24
Alternative ideas that are dreamt up

287
00:19:52,31 --> 00:19:55,62
that really work well for here do happen
even though it's terribly expensive to do

288
00:19:55,62 --> 00:19:59,75
that that we can do it.
Because a lot of things.

289
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,32
Gets short circuited because they
are because it's too expensive

290
00:20:05,81 --> 00:20:09,19
but they can if people put their heart
and soul into like governments say like.

291
00:20:09,85 --> 00:20:11,73
You know. Let's do it.

292
00:20:11,85 --> 00:20:12,57
It's a good idea

293
00:20:12,57 --> 00:20:19,19
that all the drug issue in the mainstream
would be totally change if this becomes.

294
00:20:19,21 --> 00:20:23,86
You know a walk thoroughfare with all
kinds of people cultures which it will be

295
00:20:23,86 --> 00:20:27,50
once it becomes a more it'll be a lot
more people walking all kinds of cultures

296
00:20:27,50 --> 00:20:29,14
already changing nipponese changing.

297
00:20:29,31 --> 00:20:33,01
That whole thing that of him
and just being sort of.

298
00:20:33,65 --> 00:20:40,00
That's just that was a particular. And i'll
be just another scene which will. Well.

299
00:20:40,38 --> 00:20:41,68
We need to find problem.

300
00:20:41,70 --> 00:20:43,18
Solutions to helping people

301
00:20:43,18 --> 00:20:48,03
that are really drug you know
creative you know really screwed up

302
00:20:49,56 --> 00:20:52,49
and hopefully putting you know the
whole drug issues put into perspective

303
00:20:53,37 --> 00:20:57,51
perspective especially that.

304
00:20:57,52 --> 00:21:01,31
You know marijuana for instance you know
and just suppression of information.

305
00:21:01,36 --> 00:21:03,41
What it is and then

306
00:21:03,41 --> 00:21:08,16
that education would put it above put it
on level doesn't go underground because

307
00:21:08,16 --> 00:21:13,72
people are destroying themselves
with fear and and and

308
00:21:13,72 --> 00:21:20,53
and they being the being manipulated
the being being exploited

309
00:21:20,53 --> 00:21:23,05
by criminal elements.

310
00:21:23,07 --> 00:21:29,54
Not not not by korean elements by
elements which owing to the greed same

311
00:21:29,54 --> 00:21:35,83
greed that i portray people into quick
money to do the chopping down forests.

312
00:21:35,85 --> 00:21:38,02
And to for it's.

313
00:21:38,63 --> 00:21:41,08
For wood shipping and so
for multinational level

314
00:21:41,89 --> 00:21:45,19
and getting a quick get as much out
of the environment or polluting.

315
00:21:45,77 --> 00:21:46,12
So

316
00:21:46,12 --> 00:21:51,81
that they you know just just so they can make
money just the whole thing is just making

317
00:21:51,81 --> 00:21:52,87
money out of drugs

318
00:21:52,87 --> 00:21:57,10
and it's the same sort of mentality of
people just exploiting unexploited people by

319
00:21:57,10 --> 00:21:59,94
giving them. Stuff that
they shouldn't be give.

320
00:22:01,14 --> 00:22:04,89
And but they can't be and
the only way you can.

321
00:22:05,38 --> 00:22:10,78
Change that situation is first
of all to make it totally bleak.

322
00:22:10,84 --> 00:22:14,99
Because police are involved as well as
governments involved with the whole

323
00:22:14,99 --> 00:22:20,32
distribution of drugs petrol chemical
companies make it the whole drug pop talk

324
00:22:20,32 --> 00:22:23,76
popping drugs thing is not just about.

325
00:22:23,78 --> 00:22:29,03
About smoking and that is it's
always been with these drugs

326
00:22:30,01 --> 00:22:34,02
and the only way that you can
be mystified is education

327
00:22:34,02 --> 00:22:35,68
and is a better way of living.

328
00:22:36,03 --> 00:22:40,43
And i emphasize the positive of you can
do away with it. I mean subprocess you.

329
00:22:40,69 --> 00:22:43,31
Certain people have
gone on it. Get off it.

330
00:22:43,41 --> 00:22:48,83
And get on with you know not destroying
themselves it would so all rescue them

331
00:22:48,83 --> 00:22:52,52
beforehand by saying hey
you know. We don't.

332
00:22:52,54 --> 00:22:54,92
These are the alternative
try these things out.

333
00:22:55,13 --> 00:22:59,82
You know you've got two people come to
nimbin looking for seeking a change.

334
00:22:59,84 --> 00:23:01,07
You know it's a it's a refuge.

335
00:23:01,36 --> 00:23:05,61
It's a refuge to neiman's a
refuge for four people that are.

336
00:23:05,96 --> 00:23:10,56
Of had it had it really bad out there in
the in the world into sort of a kind of

337
00:23:10,56 --> 00:23:14,33
place at all in place so i mean
these issues have to be addressed

338
00:23:14,33 --> 00:23:19,50
and as there's no simplistic answer because
we're dealing with the whole world.

339
00:23:20,17 --> 00:23:22,43
Global brain thinking about it.

340
00:23:22,53 --> 00:23:26,71
So we just got to look what other people
how other people are dealing with the drug

341
00:23:26,71 --> 00:23:31,40
drug issues and how it's changing and
helping to change the law and these ideas

342
00:23:31,40 --> 00:23:36,49
and hopefully nimal come up with an
innovative idea to try out to. To.

343
00:23:37,12 --> 00:23:43,99
To change the situation here. I've got
my ideas of. You know communities and.

344
00:23:44,01 --> 00:23:49,62
Where people can plant trees and. You
know things for an environment and.

345
00:23:49,92 --> 00:23:51,84
Hang around music around it

346
00:23:51,84 --> 00:23:55,92
and i'd like the whole thing of festival
continuous festival but they can.

347
00:23:56,15 --> 00:23:59,82
They doing things for the environment
living on the earth and they're doing.

348
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:02,22
Things in these sort of getting volvic

349
00:24:02,22 --> 00:24:09,01
that sort of integrate themselves
with with a culture that's

350
00:24:09,02 --> 00:24:12,99
one thing i mean and
this. And just infinite.

351
00:24:13,01 --> 00:24:16,86
Ideas of that sort of creative
living creative living

352
00:24:17,79 --> 00:24:21,90
and healing ourselves because the whole
thing aquarius was about survival.

353
00:24:22,03 --> 00:24:27,07
I mean it was that the whole key thing of
the craft festival was crying crying out.

354
00:24:27,66 --> 00:24:34,19
We are destroying ourselves you know wars
destroying the in the the pollution is

355
00:24:34,19 --> 00:24:36,52
like we were aware of the
pollution in the city

356
00:24:37,93 --> 00:24:43,63
and it is out the back
straight through. So.

357
00:24:43,65 --> 00:24:49,19
We've got to save you know like save the
planet that's the key phrase of save the

358
00:24:49,19 --> 00:24:54,99
earth of woodstock at the moment you
know the woodstock. For instance and.

359
00:24:56,09 --> 00:24:58,10
But that that's that's it.

360
00:24:58,13 --> 00:24:59,69
We need to become healers on the earth

361
00:25:00,39 --> 00:25:02,73
and so we've got a lot
of knowledge developed

362
00:25:02,73 --> 00:25:06,97
and got to keep developing because
we haven't got a lot of strength

363
00:25:06,98 --> 00:25:10,51
and our individual.
Energy and be brave and.

364
00:25:12,18 --> 00:25:17,95
And an exercise your. Your
communication skills.

365
00:25:21,31 --> 00:25:21,50
Rise

366
00:25:21,50 --> 00:25:26,62
and i hope everybody puts energy towards
next year's aquarius not it's not just about

367
00:25:26,62 --> 00:25:30,03
a festival it's about
celebrating a period in time

368
00:25:30,03 --> 00:25:34,90
and a milestone in time so the
ideas come out of the community.

369
00:25:35,93 --> 00:25:37,58
You know all forms of the community.

370
00:25:37,60 --> 00:25:41,54
I mean a government people come
out and and put on a forum

371
00:25:42,32 --> 00:25:44,37
or want to forum about government.

372
00:25:44,51 --> 00:25:48,01
You know to get together with
about alternative government and.

373
00:25:49,31 --> 00:25:51,36
And so forth and have it as
part of the celebration.

374
00:25:51,63 --> 00:25:58,58
Anyone just under the banner of
aquarius foundation. 3:5 forward.

375
00:25:58,60 --> 00:26:03,11
Her plug for. They're critical
foundation. But their careers.

376
00:26:03,13 --> 00:26:03,93
Next year is

377
00:26:03,93 --> 00:26:07,68
and through the no news by getting touch
with members is to get in touch in never

378
00:26:07,68 --> 00:26:08,58
news and that that

379
00:26:08,58 --> 00:26:15,00
that women use is a good
a good a good connection

380
00:26:15,91 --> 00:26:17,81
with development of the
thinking of members.

381
00:26:19,14 --> 00:26:23,51
So if people really want to know
how nimble it is been developing

382
00:26:23,51 --> 00:26:30,44
and is subscribed in then when
you is post office box name and.

383
00:26:30,46 --> 00:26:35,24
To a 9 thing like three to one.
You know post office member.

384
00:26:35,30 --> 00:26:38,80
So that's.
