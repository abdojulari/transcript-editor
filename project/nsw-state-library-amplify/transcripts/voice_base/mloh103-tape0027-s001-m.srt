1
00:00:12,45 --> 00:00:17,00
I'm i'm alive again. All right. A lot.
I should explain it a bit like this.

2
00:00:17,20 --> 00:00:20,48
I'm an economist and a researcher

3
00:00:21,62 --> 00:00:25,20
and i know what you can
do with statistics.

4
00:00:25,22 --> 00:00:29,22
With statistics you used
to package the philosophy

5
00:00:29,22 --> 00:00:31,05
and you can do it anywhere you want to.

6
00:00:31,77 --> 00:00:33,66
So you can look at bill
and cliff as a village

7
00:00:33,66 --> 00:00:38,38
and you can brush it with the
the pta of welfare dependency

8
00:00:38,38 --> 00:00:41,43
and say look this got a
taxpayer so much money

9
00:00:42,53 --> 00:00:45,85
and it's being done the same
time that with the other side.

10
00:00:46,99 --> 00:00:50,52
The reason why there was welfare
dependency here was it was created by

11
00:00:50,52 --> 00:00:56,59
systematically was going any asset we had
into local council conditions including

12
00:00:56,59 --> 00:00:58,13
five million dollar.

13
00:00:59,50 --> 00:01:03,09
Bridges and fifty thousand dollar
roads and was and the amount of cost.

14
00:01:03,28 --> 00:01:05,92
So we never could build a commercial
infrastructure was denied.

15
00:01:07,03 --> 00:01:10,10
Secondly even if that
wouldn't have taken place.

16
00:01:11,25 --> 00:01:13,59
You must value a model

17
00:01:13,59 --> 00:01:17,57
that can make out of a hundred thousand
dollar property a 10 million dollar

18
00:01:17,57 --> 00:01:19,87
property within 10 years time each

19
00:01:19,88 --> 00:01:24,44
and every individual who had no money 10
years ago now got a home worth 50 60 70

20
00:01:24,44 --> 00:01:27,78
thousand dollars unencumbered
by the banking system.

21
00:01:28,14 --> 00:01:34,26
We changed a property as john said it could
not support one farmer family could not

22
00:01:34,26 --> 00:01:39,21
have had a work of the land and now
supporting 80 families and in time.

23
00:01:39,40 --> 00:01:43,22
Well one it adds to the national
assets 10 million bucks.

24
00:01:43,82 --> 00:01:47,51
Which is a lot more than this village ever
got into yourselves security receipts

25
00:01:48,55 --> 00:01:51,85
and secondly it actually just a very thing

26
00:01:51,85 --> 00:01:55,56
that everybody's talking about now which
is ecologic sustainable development.

27
00:01:56,08 --> 00:01:59,79
You're nurtured in earth rod and poison
if you take control of your own.

28
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:06,50
I've on having it ruled yet you produce
your own product for them to import them

29
00:02:06,50 --> 00:02:11,50
and you feel the community values are
there people here more buy more their own

30
00:02:11,50 --> 00:02:12,36
gear these days.

31
00:02:12,47 --> 00:02:16,52
Become less dependent on exports
from less depend on the motorcar

32
00:02:16,52 --> 00:02:22,10
and brings tourist dollars in by
showing other people how to do this.

33
00:02:22,47 --> 00:02:29,05
This is what third stage in this latest
deal is on about now we've gone for

34
00:02:29,05 --> 00:02:33,31
in kraft we've gone for farmers.

35
00:02:33,33 --> 00:02:37,71
With processed food dried
food and nursery at a nursery

36
00:02:37,71 --> 00:02:41,09
and then we're going for some sort
of eco tourism these other things

37
00:02:41,09 --> 00:02:45,45
that the infrastructure that will make
it worthwhile for tourists to come here

38
00:02:45,45 --> 00:02:47,89
and have a look at but a year 2000.

39
00:02:48,04 --> 00:02:51,23
It will be very very
difficult to buy into bill

40
00:02:51,23 --> 00:02:54,13
and cliff's very difficult
it will be family plots

41
00:02:54,13 --> 00:02:56,69
and they won't leave the
family to be that valuable.

42
00:02:56,92 --> 00:03:00,45
It'll be a training institute
for this lifestyle

43
00:03:01,24 --> 00:03:06,28
and a tactical him right around to the
world because we offer here now all the

44
00:03:06,28 --> 00:03:08,51
things that we were dreaming about

45
00:03:08,51 --> 00:03:12,89
and just to bring about in the
cities which is to have a fresh air.

46
00:03:12,96 --> 00:03:17,39
You have no payments to degrade you don't
pollute to degrade you have a you grow

47
00:03:17,39 --> 00:03:21,11
beautiful food. You know how to
do the healing arts and so on.

48
00:03:23,76 --> 00:03:24,67
So.

49
00:03:24,69 --> 00:03:29,12
That process of eco tourism is taking place now
it's a regional thing we started something

50
00:03:29,12 --> 00:03:32,81
which is catching fire regionally now
and it can't intervene when as well.

51
00:03:34,27 --> 00:03:39,89
It is a topic which needs discussion at
length because the community itself must

52
00:03:39,89 --> 00:03:43,91
put a values on how much they will sell
out to the great god mammon in order to

53
00:03:43,91 --> 00:03:48,95
become independent right now we are
already depend of the system as a as a

54
00:03:48,95 --> 00:03:53,12
lifestyle. In fact anything wrong
with the whole aquarius thing.

55
00:03:53,25 --> 00:03:56,73
It is that it has been
supported to the point

56
00:03:57,70 --> 00:03:59,76
that it is weak at the knees
it can walk on to something.

57
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,01
Any more is totally so security dependent

58
00:04:02,70 --> 00:04:05,56
and to have a true philosophy
for the next century

59
00:04:06,60 --> 00:04:10,18
and we hope an eclipse is in
fact a leading part of this.

60
00:04:10,34 --> 00:04:12,93
It must become financially independent.

61
00:04:13,50 --> 00:04:19,19
You gotta roll to get your sat river you
cannot keep on saying i'm for the ferry

62
00:04:19,19 --> 00:04:20,75
mean yeah yeah.

63
00:04:23,12 --> 00:04:27,79
By the way.

64
00:04:27,81 --> 00:04:30,27
Mine.

65
00:04:31,77 --> 00:04:37,62
That that has happened and there
are still a few private places.

66
00:04:38,12 --> 00:04:44,18
Right. Okay sure the strata title.

67
00:04:44,31 --> 00:04:49,68
It didn't really improve people's
chances of making more money.

68
00:04:49,87 --> 00:04:54,10
It just made it easier for people to buy
because on a straight a title they could

69
00:04:54,10 --> 00:04:58,59
get a larger than whereas on a multiple
occupancy you could on a multiple occupancy.

70
00:04:59,18 --> 00:05:02,53
Let's say a house that's
for sale here for 80 grand

71
00:05:03,56 --> 00:05:09,70
and will probably be sold very quickly on
a multiple occupancy you might be lucky

72
00:05:09,70 --> 00:05:10,98
and get 24.

73
00:05:12,79 --> 00:05:16,38
Because you can't borrow money on the
strength that much runtime you get two

74
00:05:16,38 --> 00:05:20,41
or three. Yes you would just be very
lucky to get any sort of money back.

75
00:05:20,54 --> 00:05:22,07
Well that was one of the.

76
00:05:22,34 --> 00:05:27,39
When we had to go for the strata title
a lot of people didn't want back here.

77
00:05:27,56 --> 00:05:29,34
You know and we had to look at all.

78
00:05:29,47 --> 00:05:32,47
It was about five alternatives
that we had to study

79
00:05:34,41 --> 00:05:37,88
and the strata title
came out as the winner.

80
00:05:38,01 --> 00:05:39,62
Now we knew that the offshoot of

81
00:05:39,62 --> 00:05:44,55
that immediately was a lot more rights
because we'd have to pay individual rights

82
00:05:44,55 --> 00:05:48,53
to lismore council as well
as our internal levies here.

83
00:05:50,18 --> 00:05:55,24
So a lot of people didn't want
it but it was the only way

84
00:05:56,10 --> 00:06:00,05
and one of the ups of that is if already
one of the multitude of breeze. Yes.

85
00:06:00,06 --> 00:06:01,70
And people have to move away.

86
00:06:02,91 --> 00:06:06,66
They can get as much they can get enough
money to probably set themselves up

87
00:06:06,66 --> 00:06:07,36
somewhere else.

88
00:06:07,65 --> 00:06:14,52
After a fashion rather than have to walk
out with nothing in them so distraught

89
00:06:14,53 --> 00:06:20,20
is work. Good in that way but it has allowed
people to take a capital investment

90
00:06:20,20 --> 00:06:26,08
but the ones who want to sell well
we really want them to sell and go

91
00:06:26,08 --> 00:06:30,62
and maybe somebody else comes in who doesn't
want to sell you know generally people

92
00:06:30,62 --> 00:06:34,17
in a mall or in places like
billingsley do not want to sell

93
00:06:34,17 --> 00:06:38,24
and hang on to the lifestyle because
there's very little outside there you can

94
00:06:38,24 --> 00:06:38,85
compare it with

95
00:06:40,13 --> 00:06:44,05
but you've got to recognize something
must have mainstream values

96
00:06:44,05 --> 00:06:46,95
and i think one of the things

97
00:06:46,95 --> 00:06:52,80
that we are particularly interested in
this to build a bridge between mainstream

98
00:06:52,80 --> 00:06:57,27
and you'll turn it is because we've got
to integrate where once all we are male

99
00:06:57,27 --> 00:07:00,47
and female inside you know you
have in the nyang fire and water.

100
00:07:00,76 --> 00:07:05,44
It's that that capitalism
communism developed he must go

101
00:07:06,15 --> 00:07:08,86
and there must be a bridge
build and that bridge means

102
00:07:08,86 --> 00:07:15,00
that your average person can
actually attain the lifestyle

103
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:18,37
that we are society now proclaim
to be ecologically sustainable.

104
00:07:18,92 --> 00:07:24,40
Yeah and to do that you must have
a model that a large to do so.

105
00:07:24,43 --> 00:07:27,39
I wonder things and i can be clear about
bill in clashes when you listen to it

106
00:07:27,39 --> 00:07:32,39
when listen to ourself talking it seems
like an enclave of a club almost how do you

107
00:07:32,39 --> 00:07:35,44
get in. How do you achieve
things like this not true.

108
00:07:35,44 --> 00:07:38,37
You come in and you go
like any other village.

109
00:07:39,36 --> 00:07:44,43
It is no you don't know everybody on
the property division people who are

110
00:07:44,43 --> 00:07:46,41
speculators who never are here.

111
00:07:46,50 --> 00:07:49,81
There are people who are active committee
members who are they'll be meeting there

112
00:07:49,81 --> 00:07:53,75
is hermits. There's a who work in town
and don't let a lot much it's a village

113
00:07:54,60 --> 00:07:59,26
and it's easy to get an in-out. And
that sends the bridge is important.

114
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,54
Because if you tell the average person in
the city the world's falling apart the

115
00:08:04,54 --> 00:08:06,86
bombs about to drop to flank
us this is about to collapse.

116
00:08:07,13 --> 00:08:10,62
Blah blah all the whole city is going to
do you know it's no good if you can see

117
00:08:10,62 --> 00:08:12,60
the food the more you can someone
be on that beach any more.

118
00:08:13,79 --> 00:08:18,24
And you say what you alternate world in
multiple occupancy you've got no rights at

119
00:08:18,24 --> 00:08:20,06
home. One is grand. Can we sell the place

120
00:08:20,06 --> 00:08:25,03
and you have local council fighting you
so bilic list was set up to say to the

121
00:08:25,03 --> 00:08:29,63
mainstream person. Yes you can do it.
You've got the safety of private property.

122
00:08:30,17 --> 00:08:36,24
You have all the benefits of a
socially conscious infrastructure.

123
00:08:37,47 --> 00:08:41,05
Policy. Creating.

124
00:08:42,51 --> 00:08:46,80
Military asked him you know i
don't reserve and i don't i think

125
00:08:46,80 --> 00:08:51,36
that that's a kind of if he is.

126
00:08:51,38 --> 00:08:56,65
You know that a bit of nimbin if he
bullshit that everyone around to it

127
00:08:56,65 --> 00:08:59,61
when i have been around
yeah okay i've got a t.v..

128
00:08:59,91 --> 00:09:01,45
I don't watch it all the time

129
00:09:01,45 --> 00:09:06,63
but i like to play the odd video we like
to drink fruit juice. We've got a mixer.

130
00:09:07,64 --> 00:09:09,19
We've got three panels out there.

131
00:09:09,36 --> 00:09:15,41
I came here where i had a many
lives before i came here in

132
00:09:15,42 --> 00:09:20,55
1975 i was an insert two thousand
dollars a year as a training officer.

133
00:09:20,57 --> 00:09:23,37
I had a bit of bread. It ran out rapidly.

134
00:09:24,58 --> 00:09:27,31
But you know we've got a few solar panels

135
00:09:27,31 --> 00:09:32,42
but there's no one here who hasn't
got one solar panel where i came

136
00:09:32,42 --> 00:09:33,56
when we landed here.

137
00:09:34,57 --> 00:09:39,56
Our power source was our car battery
which i carried into the house

138
00:09:39,56 --> 00:09:45,43
and ruined 100 to read indian beautiful
indian muslim chair then i got two car

139
00:09:45,43 --> 00:09:46,51
batteries one.

140
00:09:46,55 --> 00:09:49,13
Oh i had one in the car
and one in the house

141
00:09:49,13 --> 00:09:53,28
and only had to change them once a
week. Nevertheless it's their handle.

142
00:09:53,73 --> 00:10:00,61
Then to family and stuff. Come to john
it but it's. Because. As we live.

143
00:10:00,68 --> 00:10:03,07
Like this it does not mean to say

144
00:10:04,58 --> 00:10:09,15
that there are certain things in
technology that we don't want.

145
00:10:09,40 --> 00:10:13,28
I'm not afraid of technology. I
love it if it's appropriate.

146
00:10:14,54 --> 00:10:20,52
I'm not drawing it doesn't take me for
barolo does of coal to fire up a bloody

147
00:10:20,52 --> 00:10:22,85
great power house to boil a cup of water.

148
00:10:25,01 --> 00:10:30,16
You know do something really
interesting at the root of debt and

149
00:10:30,16 --> 00:10:33,15
that is if mainstream
didn't have the answers.

150
00:10:33,26 --> 00:10:37,61
It has the answer we didn't live like
achieve it. You know the occupancy.

151
00:10:38,54 --> 00:10:40,87
I've got to say this is just as wrong

152
00:10:41,78 --> 00:10:45,87
and i'm not knocking multiple occupancy
because they have been a life raft for many

153
00:10:45,87 --> 00:10:48,25
people still are and still
are you today will be.

154
00:10:48,42 --> 00:10:53,56
And as i said i don't know if they've got
their place but as a social experiment.

155
00:10:54,33 --> 00:10:59,87
It is essentially flawed and the
reason why communism is breaking down

156
00:10:59,87 --> 00:11:02,52
and in russia is because

157
00:11:02,52 --> 00:11:06,78
that old communist model of common
ownership just doesn't work.

158
00:11:07,88 --> 00:11:10,81
I'm not saying that it couldn't
work in some idealists society.

159
00:11:11,19 --> 00:11:13,00
But in the here and now on this earth.

160
00:11:13,28 --> 00:11:18,07
It just doesn't work because there is some
people who will steal who will obstruct

161
00:11:18,07 --> 00:11:20,26
who will be too paranoid to participate.

162
00:11:20,28 --> 00:11:23,08
It falls apart as fall apart
and seychelles and fall apart

163
00:11:23,08 --> 00:11:25,40
and now to flanders told part and russia.

164
00:11:25,44 --> 00:11:31,23
It's followed by the nimbin now it may
well fall apart because establishment is

165
00:11:31,23 --> 00:11:33,45
pushing it rapidly along a
good it wants to collapse.

166
00:11:33,48 --> 00:11:38,20
But basically you do need some
of that what you said was

167
00:11:38,20 --> 00:11:40,94
that gentrifying establishment feeling.

168
00:11:41,10 --> 00:11:47,08
We all need to have a base and i
myself find private property.

169
00:11:47,31 --> 00:11:48,86
I have a problem with that notion.

170
00:11:49,31 --> 00:11:52,78
I do believe in a lifelong
lease of ownership

171
00:11:52,78 --> 00:11:54,76
and that's how i regard
our torrance title.

172
00:11:55,65 --> 00:11:57,74
I know it's not like that
but it higher regard it.

173
00:11:57,79 --> 00:12:01,84
We were originally set up here to lease.
The land from ourselves. And when we die.

174
00:12:02,07 --> 00:12:04,14
It goes back to the community.

175
00:12:04,15 --> 00:12:07,32
You know but that's not the
system we work and that we have

176
00:12:07,32 --> 00:12:10,85
but we are approximating it
closely. There is nothing wrong.

177
00:12:11,40 --> 00:12:14,89
In fact it is very necessary to find

178
00:12:14,89 --> 00:12:17,85
that bridge between where
you say no this is mine

179
00:12:18,79 --> 00:12:20,44
and what you say you know
i've got to share here

180
00:12:21,48 --> 00:12:26,30
and mainstream society is
overly too much in a head trip.

181
00:12:26,45 --> 00:12:30,01
They get all the right answers but no
one can actually do without the friends

182
00:12:30,01 --> 00:12:32,28
and they want can do without
the infrastructure.

183
00:12:32,31 --> 00:12:35,15
So we flush of problems down
the toilet and we just say

184
00:12:35,15 --> 00:12:40,23
and wish for a better world if you
go to the multiple occupancy scene.

185
00:12:40,45 --> 00:12:42,76
You actually live the ideal lifestyle.

186
00:12:43,25 --> 00:12:49,67
But you can never actually
satisfy those few basic needs

187
00:12:49,67 --> 00:12:52,77
that are coming up every once in
a while like you are dirt poor

188
00:12:52,77 --> 00:12:55,86
and your teeth follow a path on
you or your marriage falls apart

189
00:12:55,86 --> 00:12:57,82
and you can't sell your
house and you're stuck.

190
00:12:57,94 --> 00:13:01,75
So you need an interim thing where
you have all the right philosophies

191
00:13:01,75 --> 00:13:04,41
that christ came up with the same time

192
00:13:05,21 --> 00:13:09,42
and then bite size of society
at large and that sense.

193
00:13:10,42 --> 00:13:12,72
Yeah that actually works
on a human level as well.

194
00:13:14,08 --> 00:13:14,23
Yeah

195
00:13:14,24 --> 00:13:19,08
and i think that's what we've got in i
think we are we are not saying we are the

196
00:13:19,08 --> 00:13:25,09
ultimate we are a stepping stone
from that one way street to nowhere.

197
00:13:26,09 --> 00:13:27,34
The community.

198
00:13:29,18 --> 00:13:34,33
You see that's what they try to do to us
they try to shunt us down a one way street.

199
00:13:35,09 --> 00:13:38,75
And that's when we said no. And.

200
00:13:40,24 --> 00:13:43,50
When i say that i'm not being
derogatory about the places

201
00:13:43,50 --> 00:13:47,11
or the people they came at their
time and they served their purpose

202
00:13:48,52 --> 00:13:55,13
but they didn't spread. You know
so really it was a cocooned trip.

203
00:13:55,44 --> 00:13:59,84
Now we believe that the time is.

204
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,63
Coming where we're going to have to spread

205
00:14:02,63 --> 00:14:06,27
and we believe there'll
be places for like ours.

206
00:14:06,31 --> 00:14:12,09
You see my greatest dream is to see
undone a 60 year massacre of trees

207
00:14:12,09 --> 00:14:17,98
that took place through this big scrub i
would like to see a hundred year project

208
00:14:19,22 --> 00:14:21,78
set to read green the big scrap

209
00:14:22,96 --> 00:14:27,50
and it would be done by the
young folk who can do the work.

210
00:14:27,51 --> 00:14:32,74
It could involve kindergarden and primary
school through our secondary schools

211
00:14:32,74 --> 00:14:34,21
and through our universities.

212
00:14:36,55 --> 00:14:40,97
It could within 10 years it would
be such a major tourist attraction

213
00:14:41,99 --> 00:14:43,03
that it would fund itself.

214
00:14:45,09 --> 00:14:50,65
Kids have got nothing to do give them
something to take them to some land

215
00:14:50,65 --> 00:14:55,28
and this you work this land for five years

216
00:14:55,28 --> 00:15:01,11
and replanted next gives you the right
to live on their land for as long as you

217
00:15:01,11 --> 00:15:06,98
live. This is what we've got to do and
we've got to do it in a massive way

218
00:15:06,98 --> 00:15:13,86
and this big scrub area here would be
the ideal place to start would him

219
00:15:13,86 --> 00:15:13,99
involved.

220
00:15:14,38 --> 00:15:19,34
Every village in every little town
could participate immediately

221
00:15:21,12 --> 00:15:28,07
and put their youth to work but sell it
to them and make it as popular as skin.

222
00:15:28,22 --> 00:15:33,95
It is admin is in berlin. You know make
them our skinheads the tree painters.

223
00:15:34,14 --> 00:15:40,21
So we've got to let them go their set them
up with camps let them have their music.

224
00:15:40,26 --> 00:15:42,44
Let them have a smoke a
doubt if they want it.

225
00:15:42,53 --> 00:15:46,91
Not too much alcohol that like alcohol.

226
00:15:48,81 --> 00:15:53,17
I do see both very very.

227
00:15:53,92 --> 00:15:58,22
Clearly acidity the problem that mainstream
when you live in a place like this.

228
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,78
When you have people as you saw a year

229
00:16:02,78 --> 00:16:05,99
or two ago killing each other for the
right to sleep in a public toilet

230
00:16:05,99 --> 00:16:12,11
and all related to death by a teenage girl
for the right to sleep in a toilet our

231
00:16:12,11 --> 00:16:17,79
society. Actually creates all this angst
on the television you're being told

232
00:16:17,79 --> 00:16:23,16
that the old zone layer is falling apart
and the job prospects and you and

233
00:16:23,16 --> 00:16:26,56
that you are being caged into the system
clock sometimes a collapse because

234
00:16:26,56 --> 00:16:29,19
when you want to go out
you can't buy the land.

235
00:16:29,76 --> 00:16:32,51
All the great revolutions
around the world.

236
00:16:32,79 --> 00:16:37,07
All of them have been about ownership
of land. Make no mistake about it.

237
00:16:37,21 --> 00:16:39,10
Multitude was about land.

238
00:16:39,19 --> 00:16:41,51
The french revolution of that
land it's all about land

239
00:16:42,72 --> 00:16:45,97
and the land in australia today is managed

240
00:16:45,97 --> 00:16:49,54
or i should say mismanaged
to old world concepts

241
00:16:49,54 --> 00:16:55,93
that are in essence saying the local
inhabitant has no right to exist he

242
00:16:55,93 --> 00:17:01,14
susceptible and the local resources
are there to be exploited.

243
00:17:01,17 --> 00:17:06,52
So we're now shifting into the 21st century
where we're saying exploitation is over

244
00:17:06,52 --> 00:17:09,67
roads rain timbers are
made in the cabinets.

245
00:17:10,45 --> 00:17:12,59
Now we actually have to face a
problem actually living here.

246
00:17:13,17 --> 00:17:17,68
We've got to change european
dominated australian culture.

247
00:17:18,36 --> 00:17:22,75
Anglicized to some extent what ever it
is into a truly local culture and for

248
00:17:22,75 --> 00:17:25,57
that reason they don't we
built a model for bill

249
00:17:25,57 --> 00:17:29,96
and cliff emotionally within ourselves we
borrowed a lot from knowing debt ridden

250
00:17:29,96 --> 00:17:33,04
you cultivate all the pacific
islander culture and niman

251
00:17:33,04 --> 00:17:34,67
and i'm tenement tenable yeah

252
00:17:34,67 --> 00:17:38,01
and that's an interesting thing about this
level of communism as to how deep you

253
00:17:38,01 --> 00:17:40,08
should go before you reach equity

254
00:17:40,08 --> 00:17:46,61
when you go to original inhabitants the
lifestyle which are living today still in

255
00:17:46,61 --> 00:17:48,29
cape york and as you know we work.

256
00:17:49,54 --> 00:17:56,11
There is not wanting communism there is a
chief who holds certain large amount of

257
00:17:56,11 --> 00:17:59,88
land interest for the population.
So when someone gets married in.

258
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,30
A bit of land there is systems of
ownership even operating on that level.

259
00:18:06,08 --> 00:18:09,84
So we have the same systems here we must
create the same systems are not what you

260
00:18:09,84 --> 00:18:14,30
say anyway belongs to everybody and
iki has been the enemy from within.

261
00:18:14,56 --> 00:18:22,21
For us adri really hard to do as we can as
i said to be philosophy are real problem.

262
00:18:22,23 --> 00:18:26,08
On the outside it has been overbearing
system on the inside it have been the worst

263
00:18:26,08 --> 00:18:30,25
for thinkers who want to be left alone.
You know one anarchist studio is.

264
00:18:30,59 --> 00:18:33,52
Can make more trouble than 20 on is it

265
00:18:34,31 --> 00:18:39,43
but i've always been a bit anarchistic
myself so i could understand an occasion.

266
00:18:40,70 --> 00:18:46,15
What you have to do you have to present
the bill and clear. Whatever happens.

267
00:18:47,83 --> 00:18:49,78
You have to go to the residence meeting

268
00:18:49,78 --> 00:18:54,78
and you just if you want something to happen
you just have to present a better case

269
00:18:55,73 --> 00:18:57,28
than the ones who don't want to.

270
00:18:58,95 --> 00:19:04,31
You know and it really is
a low level democracy.

271
00:19:04,44 --> 00:19:09,56
You know we've got about
seventy four families here

272
00:19:09,56 --> 00:19:15,75
and we have a resident meeting
once a month the residents

273
00:19:15,75 --> 00:19:19,19
make all the decisions about everything

274
00:19:19,19 --> 00:19:22,18
that meeting is usually
attended by about 30.

275
00:19:23,40 --> 00:19:26,64
Residents a core group who are always

276
00:19:27,94 --> 00:19:32,19
and odd ones who float in because there
might be a top a from their some.

277
00:19:33,61 --> 00:19:36,23
It's basically it's a business meeting

278
00:19:36,99 --> 00:19:40,71
and it should be transplant into suburban
australia it's youtube of course it

279
00:19:40,71 --> 00:19:44,15
should be of course to empower
neighborhood you got to start talking

280
00:19:44,96 --> 00:19:47,46
and if you have people running around
your neighborhood there are not doing

281
00:19:47,46 --> 00:19:52,02
anything to give them a job replanting
cleaning the sidewalks up helping the old

282
00:19:52,02 --> 00:19:53,69
lady with her herd who are her meal.

283
00:19:53,74 --> 00:19:57,74
So we come soberly begin our system
we forgotten about the little people

284
00:19:58,85 --> 00:19:59,79
and really want to start.

285
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,74
Looking no matter how difficult a process
is wonderful things happen on a job you

286
00:20:04,74 --> 00:20:10,34
know when issues are contentious
debate can get pretty heated.

287
00:20:10,36 --> 00:20:14,27
But if nothing else here.
We respect the chair.

288
00:20:15,93 --> 00:20:21,43
So i think you know all the ten years
i've ever been here i've only tended one

289
00:20:21,43 --> 00:20:26,23
meeting where the chair
couldn't control the me and

290
00:20:26,24 --> 00:20:29,51
that was a really nasty so.

291
00:20:32,73 --> 00:20:39,18
You know our politics a pretty good here
so people who lobby get things done

292
00:20:39,18 --> 00:20:43,12
but if the majority of people
don't think it's a good idea.

293
00:20:43,22 --> 00:20:50,56
It doesn't get a deal.

294
00:20:52,60 --> 00:20:57,31
Well the acquired idea was 20 years
old. You know couch man came to me.

295
00:20:58,48 --> 00:21:01,74
And when really water

296
00:21:01,74 --> 00:21:08,67
when he he asked the question if
not one twenty five times he says

297
00:21:09,58 --> 00:21:15,52
but what happened to all the i do you know
all these young ebenezer changed your

298
00:21:15,52 --> 00:21:19,89
middle age you show me any
group of people in society.

299
00:21:20,44 --> 00:21:24,78
You haven't changed in the last 20
years and i say yes it's a graveyard.

300
00:21:27,66 --> 00:21:29,98
Everybody changes. Everybody.

301
00:21:30,02 --> 00:21:36,57
I also want to point out that that the
aquarian ideal never was owned by noon.

302
00:21:37,46 --> 00:21:38,99
It was owned by everybody.

303
00:21:40,10 --> 00:21:46,46
And it was in poland that it was
in amsterdam it was in california.

304
00:21:46,48 --> 00:21:49,02
It was here. We just made one shrine.

305
00:21:49,71 --> 00:21:54,51
For christ first of all 1973 which allowed
australians to have one place to go to

306
00:21:54,51 --> 00:21:57,19
what you could sit and think
about this wonderful columbus

307
00:21:57,19 --> 00:21:59,23
that you actually are peaceful.

308
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,21
And organic and and sharing and so
on and none of this is completely

309
00:22:04,21 --> 00:22:05,97
and all of us try to be a little bit.

310
00:22:06,31 --> 00:22:10,02
So i see aquarius now everywhere
to me when i look at society.

311
00:22:10,04 --> 00:22:15,03
It's very green all those philosophies
which were expanded 73 are now everywhere

312
00:22:15,03 --> 00:22:16,71
here and i can be here

313
00:22:16,71 --> 00:22:20,10
and happily talk about aquarius even
though i wasn't here not you 73 it wasn't

314
00:22:20,10 --> 00:22:22,19
california i didn't come here until 79

315
00:22:22,92 --> 00:22:26,37
and yet i feel the same philosophy
because i share with all the other ones

316
00:22:26,37 --> 00:22:29,74
that feeling that we are part
of sponsible for the planet

317
00:22:30,54 --> 00:22:33,68
and we are optimistic i do something
about it and with that ice.

318
00:22:33,83 --> 00:22:38,01
I realize that would indeed rock
aceh from canberra to have to perth.

319
00:22:38,03 --> 00:22:44,64
Sane people as opposed to put it
in a nutshell for me the essence

320
00:22:44,64 --> 00:22:50,66
of the 20 years is in the
development of what you see

321
00:22:50,66 --> 00:22:51,95
when you drive around this knowledge.

322
00:22:53,76 --> 00:22:59,86
That's the aquarium to me is
here living strong gradings

323
00:22:59,87 --> 00:23:06,01
gaining strength every day more more
people putting trees in more more people

324
00:23:06,01 --> 00:23:10,04
concerned about environmental issues more

325
00:23:10,04 --> 00:23:12,48
and more people writing
letters about those matters

326
00:23:13,49 --> 00:23:15,34
and people get involved in the things

327
00:23:15,34 --> 00:23:20,67
that we held dear then we didn't realise
just what the problems were then to what

328
00:23:20,67 --> 00:23:23,82
we know now we have a
group of people here.

329
00:23:23,84 --> 00:23:27,39
Very conscious of what's
going on in the world.

330
00:23:27,40 --> 00:23:30,91
I think that's my thing
that i would have said well

331
00:23:30,91 --> 00:23:34,57
and i think 73 were 20
years hence. Now. Yeah.

332
00:23:34,58 --> 00:23:38,00
A man comes of age is 21
they say ok and voted 18.

333
00:23:38,29 --> 00:23:42,43
I believe the ukraine movement is getting
of a did just getting towards its

334
00:23:42,43 --> 00:23:45,41
military stage its missionary
stage you probably go out and

335
00:23:45,41 --> 00:23:48,44
and want to change the
world for a little while

336
00:23:48,44 --> 00:23:51,53
and settle down in maybe
10 years time and at

337
00:23:51,53 --> 00:23:53,87
that time it becomes a mature philosophy.

338
00:23:55,09 --> 00:24:00,41
I don't i don't think the i think
philosophy is fact is stretched. From.

339
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:04,29
Earth's children who go
and sit in the forest

340
00:24:04,29 --> 00:24:09,18
and climb up poles probably to the other
end of the spectrum which was probably be.

341
00:24:10,57 --> 00:24:12,59
In the likes of a few other cities around

342
00:24:12,59 --> 00:24:16,59
but we're not going to you
know if no you know vision.

343
00:24:16,69 --> 00:24:19,91
Well it's going to take
the step on from mars.

344
00:24:20,05 --> 00:24:26,71
I'm hoping it's it's a deed devil lucian
i would i would like to see now is

345
00:24:26,71 --> 00:24:27,86
that we have set this up.

346
00:24:28,22 --> 00:24:30,59
This can be done and we all know

347
00:24:30,59 --> 00:24:34,21
that the next one should be taking a
bunch of young employed people out there

348
00:24:34,21 --> 00:24:40,53
and getting the desert to give fourth
year just to give it a straight

349
00:24:40,53 --> 00:24:44,47
that when you come of age in the
pacific islands. Yeah right.

350
00:24:44,67 --> 00:24:48,20
Of from door here and man
gets presented on marriage

351
00:24:48,92 --> 00:24:51,17
and he selected a partner with
a house and a plot of land.

352
00:24:51,46 --> 00:24:53,97
Yeah that is that is an asset.

353
00:24:54,06 --> 00:25:01,43
He gets we are in society tell people
you've got to turn it off in the beginning.

354
00:25:01,45 --> 00:25:04,35
And that creates poverty. Yeah so.

355
00:25:04,49 --> 00:25:08,92
It is a real good thing to
look at our own processes

356
00:25:08,92 --> 00:25:13,14
and saying what i we really doing
with with our world. Why in fact.

357
00:25:13,35 --> 00:25:18,57
Why is the establishment
in effect trying to.

358
00:25:18,59 --> 00:25:23,75
Well choke the life out of
want to develop a few places

359
00:25:24,88 --> 00:25:29,84
that actually try to do what it's
what we all know ought to be done.

360
00:25:30,02 --> 00:25:34,02
However now we've said a lot of
things about the lismore city council

361
00:25:35,59 --> 00:25:37,38
and i'd like to say one more thing

362
00:25:37,38 --> 00:25:41,28
and this is not by way of apology because
what we've said has been absolutely true.

363
00:25:42,43 --> 00:25:47,45
One individual drove us to
distraction try nancy lee

364
00:25:47,45 --> 00:25:51,58
and emotionally in all sorts of
ways and he was allowed to do

365
00:25:51,58 --> 00:25:56,03
that by many others but the mayor

366
00:25:56,03 --> 00:25:59,95
but three mayors ago we've gone
through about seven mayors.

367
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:04,09
And five planners and christ knows
how many engineers at all that.

368
00:26:06,66 --> 00:26:08,83
Three mayors ago.

369
00:26:08,85 --> 00:26:13,55
We struck up a report with bob
scullion who was in there that time

370
00:26:14,44 --> 00:26:17,49
and bob put us on the agenda and for

371
00:26:17,49 --> 00:26:24,18
that we're very grateful to him as an
individual since then we've also had a lot of

372
00:26:24,18 --> 00:26:26,14
support from.

373
00:26:26,16 --> 00:26:30,81
The past mayor and the committee and
the represent mayor john crowson

374
00:26:30,81 --> 00:26:37,45
and howard fredericks. So really in fact.

375
00:26:38,27 --> 00:26:39,93
What they did two hours early in the piece

376
00:26:39,93 --> 00:26:44,25
and ripped all our money off
in the end they came good

377
00:26:44,25 --> 00:26:48,38
and i give there's no barrier to
get some more money here in fact.

378
00:26:48,41 --> 00:26:52,78
So the fact that this should be said we
when you reflect on the on the history.

379
00:26:53,14 --> 00:26:57,82
You tend to get stuck and the big learning
experience in the big panes and so on.

380
00:26:57,95 --> 00:26:59,09
It shouldn't be forgotten

381
00:26:59,09 --> 00:27:03,83
that over the last few years we've become
very effective in networking throughout

382
00:27:03,83 --> 00:27:05,33
the various layers of government

383
00:27:05,33 --> 00:27:10,52
and we found very good responsiveness
general boards all the messages about why

384
00:27:10,52 --> 00:27:14,50
we're doing what we're doing. I now
understood by the average average bureaucrat.

385
00:27:14,64 --> 00:27:17,16
And there are some visionaries
within state local

386
00:27:17,16 --> 00:27:19,03
and federal government to
a billy helping us along.

387
00:27:19,25 --> 00:27:24,78
Yet i fear that yeah
that must be said and.

388
00:27:24,79 --> 00:27:41,28
It's about you know any other kind
of stuff you'd like to talk about.

389
00:27:41,30 --> 00:27:46,82
Yeah well. Yeah they are they were they
were all they were all the ones that.

390
00:27:47,19 --> 00:27:51,68
You are sorry i don't say they were the
bunch you could ever repeat our community

391
00:27:51,68 --> 00:27:52,96
pretty aggressive or sorry.

392
00:27:53,09 --> 00:27:57,85
So yeah curry's movement was a bit elitist
because there is such a thing as a

393
00:27:57,85 --> 00:27:59,82
trickle down theory and a lot.

394
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:01,39
If and you also find

395
00:28:01,39 --> 00:28:06,01
that the ones who had dyno shin the
students did not were not the people who

396
00:28:06,01 --> 00:28:09,75
actually buy a large video. The
tilling of the soil with their hands.

397
00:28:10,99 --> 00:28:13,03
So i think one of the nice things

398
00:28:13,82 --> 00:28:17,85
that has come from a creation
of the real growth things is

399
00:28:17,85 --> 00:28:21,50
that has become a universal movement.
What i want to buy the p.h.

400
00:28:21,50 --> 00:28:25,62
D or what i want to add more
humble occasional qualifications.

401
00:28:25,79 --> 00:28:29,79
Whether you are a great debater of body
you are a silent type what you were a

402
00:28:29,79 --> 00:28:33,29
mechanic or whether you.
You know a nursery man.

403
00:28:33,42 --> 00:28:35,61
It is right throughout
the whole life. Yes.

404
00:28:35,69 --> 00:28:40,39
The thing started with the intellectuals
just like in a hundred sixty eight.

405
00:28:40,49 --> 00:28:42,51
Revolution in paris. Also as a student.

406
00:28:43,02 --> 00:28:46,97
Thing you know that happens with
students but then it comes down.

407
00:28:48,05 --> 00:28:51,49
That's what you pay students for you
know what do you think employers.

408
00:28:51,51 --> 00:28:54,51
I want to doing now as
a 93 already doing now

409
00:28:54,51 --> 00:28:57,05
and i don't do much demonstrating as well.

410
00:28:57,08 --> 00:29:01,42
My daughter to very busy going to work
to support herself so establishing a

411
00:29:01,42 --> 00:29:11,71
successful a actually frightened a lot of.

412
00:29:12,52 --> 00:29:12,57
You.

413
00:29:14,23 --> 00:29:19,40
Well i tell you how we move in here my
daughter was the first kid from here to get

414
00:29:19,40 --> 00:29:23,93
on the school bus and
they used to leave at arc

415
00:29:23,93 --> 00:29:24,93
and seats around

416
00:29:27,62 --> 00:29:32,44
and she had a very hard time for the
first few months into she started like a

417
00:29:32,44 --> 00:29:38,86
little to stick around telling the few
home truth however by the end of her first

418
00:29:38,86 --> 00:29:42,99
year at school she had started
to move into leadership roles

419
00:29:42,99 --> 00:29:48,16
and was being sent away on different
leadership courses at all. News.

420
00:29:48,36 --> 00:29:50,77
She's always been an excellent student

421
00:29:51,64 --> 00:29:56,74
and she's been motivated self-motivated
because the university trip.

422
00:29:56,82 --> 00:30:01,11
She has known since she was 12 that
we couldn't. Afford to support her.

423
00:30:02,90 --> 00:30:06,40
So. In grade 10.

424
00:30:08,62 --> 00:30:11,69
She was the lion's youth of the year

425
00:30:11,69 --> 00:30:16,77
and she did more than any other
there's a big college you know right.

426
00:30:17,96 --> 00:30:20,60
And it's got the choice
of kids from all over.

427
00:30:20,96 --> 00:30:25,10
So there was okay and for the other
kids from this other college

428
00:30:25,90 --> 00:30:30,02
that she went through three of those
she got the one from the state level.

429
00:30:30,22 --> 00:30:36,54
So she did very well that year
and at the end of grady 11.

430
00:30:38,27 --> 00:30:44,96
She won a cow tex award for all

431
00:30:44,96 --> 00:30:50,75
round excellence. Although they did
make a little bit of latitude for her.

432
00:30:50,78 --> 00:30:54,81
They allowed debating to
be reckoned as a sport.

433
00:30:56,24 --> 00:31:01,78
And in her final year she was a student
of the year so she was a particularly

434
00:31:01,78 --> 00:31:08,67
motivated girl. We have
grandchildren growing up here

435
00:31:08,67 --> 00:31:11,36
and now my daughter has
three children at home

436
00:31:13,03 --> 00:31:17,61
and i'm watching my grandchildren
grow up with interests

437
00:31:20,52 --> 00:31:27,38
bringing kids up here. It was hard
to i made a decision to come here.

438
00:31:28,63 --> 00:31:32,96
I suppose and my family
suffered and benefited for

439
00:31:32,96 --> 00:31:36,39
that you know.
