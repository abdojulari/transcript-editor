00:00:11,05 --> 00:00:14,10
This is mr. Harold rootsy who worked as

2
00:00:14,10 --> 00:00:18,14
a stone mason at the quarry at maria for
dorman long back in the days of the

3
00:00:18,14 --> 00:00:21,05
building of the bridge. Do you member
how you got the job. Do you mr.

4
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:27,14
Ity. Yes well i just came out of me. Time
in sydney and there's nothing doing up

5
00:00:27,14 --> 00:00:32,62
here. And the mayor mascot was the
manager of the firm that i work for

6
00:00:33,91 --> 00:00:39,88
and i was through him and the
friends of is that a dime

7
00:00:39,88 --> 00:00:44,79
a doorman and long we were sent down to see
them and that's where we first started

8
00:00:44,79 --> 00:00:51,00
off and got down there to maria. Do you
remember when you got there and how you

9
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:57,63
first started you member what it was
like all the work was very heavy because

10
00:00:57,63 --> 00:01:03,33
a big block. We had to to get but then we

11
00:01:04,93 --> 00:01:08,81
come. Alright. We got used to it. Did
you work in the quarry or in the stone

12
00:01:08,81 --> 00:01:14,44
dressing sheds in the stone dressing shed
on the stone dressing. Did you split the

13
00:01:14,44 --> 00:01:19,60
blocks down first. Or did it split for you
know they could they were carried first

14
00:01:19,60 --> 00:01:22,75
in that's into the rough and we made them
out of the rough each block was made at

15
00:01:22,75 --> 00:01:29,40
the rough sea and how did you go about
that. Well we had pneumatic tools and that

16
00:01:29,41 --> 00:01:32,71
and chisels and just you get a rough
block and you have to take it out

17
00:01:32,71 --> 00:01:38,07
a square per square up at four pegs and
then when you got the face of it. Excuse me

18
00:01:38,07 --> 00:01:43,89
. There were four pegs pegs like you put
the corners of the stone when you get the

19
00:01:43,89 --> 00:01:48,86
three ice the three lowest points
of the stone of the stone and put

20
00:01:48,86 --> 00:01:54,24
a peg in the lowest part the next highest
point the next one and the highest point

21
00:01:54,24 --> 00:02:00,29
. Take the poor pigs across and then
you cite them and that's how you get

22
00:02:00,29 --> 00:02:01,78
a square when you strike with

23
00:02:01,78 --> 00:02:07,59
a straight edge cross each in. And then
when you start to cut and with the

24
00:02:07,59 --> 00:02:10,74
pneumatic tools do you put a dry what
i call a draft around that's like

25
00:02:10,74 --> 00:02:17,02
a flat level right around and then you get
when you get the rough out of it get the

26
00:02:18,18 --> 00:02:18,96
gig to be a better or

27
00:02:18,96 --> 00:02:23,32
a joint you're putting on. And then when
that's on that's when you take your

28
00:02:23,32 --> 00:02:25,95
measurements and that's when
you start anything put on

29
00:02:25,95 --> 00:02:32,91
a bevel was the job different from
other jobs particularly no you know

30
00:02:34,16 --> 00:02:38,92
what i was used to where did you serve
it. And what we used to i was at my

31
00:02:38,92 --> 00:02:44,61
modelling and sons at the where the airport
is now used to be on the airport now

32
00:02:44,61 --> 00:02:50,53
it's not the you know no more. It's where
it was and that was my first job there

33
00:02:50,53 --> 00:02:56,36
was on the government savings bank which
is the commerce department now time work

34
00:02:56,36 --> 00:03:03,29
around there and we did that come
from italy already ran it and

35
00:03:03,29 --> 00:03:08,96
you cut it up here. It was also on and use
different sort of process to what it was

36
00:03:08,96 --> 00:03:13,54
down there but all roughed out and then
finished off and then the polished.

37
00:03:15,02 --> 00:03:21,12
Different bridge the bridge. Job was all
split and cut wasn't rustic there was no

38
00:03:21,12 --> 00:03:26,22
there was no cutting with sources no no
no. And all by hand out of the rough you

39
00:03:26,22 --> 00:03:32,17
got the rough block not us or on new down
from the rough. And the different sizes

40
00:03:32,17 --> 00:03:36,33
of stones that was all worked out beforehand
exactly what size you would need that

41
00:03:36,34 --> 00:03:38,11
you'd get a plan you get

42
00:03:38,11 --> 00:03:41,69
a sketch of the job in the size of
it and then you went on bevels like

43
00:03:41,69 --> 00:03:46,07
a different people's fourteen 114 to an age
when you got to bevel goes up the sides

44
00:03:46,07 --> 00:03:52,98
. And that's if you go from the big in the
bottom the smaller the top. That's an

45
00:03:52,98 --> 00:03:56,36
incredible job but it was all that will
be accurate and it'll be you know where

46
00:03:56,36 --> 00:03:59,72
they fit in. You can see that now that
i fit in. That'll be right because you

47
00:03:59,72 --> 00:04:03,75
couldn't. Mess one up and shot it away
when you got on the job they're not like

48
00:04:03,75 --> 00:04:05,03
shot a bit of brick or a bit of timber

49
00:04:05,03 --> 00:04:09,64
a way. You know the square sides
were they moved off by it. Also with

50
00:04:09,64 --> 00:04:13,63
a hand when we do it as i
say when we took them out

51
00:04:13,63 --> 00:04:17,26
a square with the pegs we'd
put out what they call

52
00:04:19,07 --> 00:04:21,04
a servicing machine on as like we call

53
00:04:21,04 --> 00:04:24,29
a four point and that would be bought by
compressed air and it would jump up and

54
00:04:24,29 --> 00:04:28,15
down and that knocked the stone down to
level. And then to be awed and by no matter

55
00:04:28,15 --> 00:04:32,71
how much and then smaller children tools
that we used to have the train. What about

56
00:04:32,71 --> 00:04:36,85
the rock face how was that and the others
rough side. That was just pitched often

57
00:04:36,85 --> 00:04:42,78
left. Would have been pitched off. Well
when you got to the flat. They just took it

58
00:04:42,78 --> 00:04:45,49
out a square not your
face on. But if you had

59
00:04:45,49 --> 00:04:50,46
a rock face which is all it is now you
just pitched it down and left it with

60
00:04:50,46 --> 00:04:55,61
a pitch until and knocked it off and just
left it as it is. A pitching tool was

61
00:04:55,61 --> 00:05:00,33
that pneumatic or was it hand or hand drill
hand we used to have. Did you do any

62
00:05:00,33 --> 00:05:05,99
further and which work. Sometimes we might
take a bit. It was a bit heavy we'd put

63
00:05:05,99 --> 00:05:08,92
a couple of plugs and feathers you
know and knock it out on a bed to

64
00:05:08,92 --> 00:05:11,28
a joint sonny on bed and joint like it was

65
00:05:11,28 --> 00:05:17,06
a bit heavy stuff. To member the working
conditions down there in the shop. Yes i

66
00:05:17,06 --> 00:05:23,81
was quite happy with them. What was
it like was it windy. Oh no i can't i

67
00:05:23,81 --> 00:05:28,92
couldn't complain the time i was there.
I see wearing masks as well. Compulsory

68
00:05:28,93 --> 00:05:31,39
that was only one servicing
machines only doing what they call

69
00:05:31,39 --> 00:05:37,31
a four point but very rarely we did i use
them. Do you remember any injuries down

70
00:05:41,33 --> 00:05:45,15
. They want to cup our they were before
my time those two there they were for my

71
00:05:45,15 --> 00:05:50,04
time the two that were killed but the one
that happened to you in the film is. Tell

72
00:05:50,04 --> 00:05:56,26
us about that. Oh well i just punching
a big british big not knocked off

73
00:05:56,26 --> 00:05:58,89
a block and you know what they call

74
00:05:58,89 --> 00:06:02,07
a ball to want what i'm like
it's about the hammer with

75
00:06:02,07 --> 00:06:08,26
a seven pound hammer or ten and not aimed
at the side because it came off and up

76
00:06:08,26 --> 00:06:14,06
onto me. Toe and let me try one. And what
happened then i had about six weeks off

77
00:06:14,06 --> 00:06:18,03
work and i walked from the
quarry to cameroon about two and

78
00:06:18,03 --> 00:06:22,46
a half miles. No transport then they wouldn't
give you transport. I never asked for

79
00:06:22,46 --> 00:06:29,26
it. I do stupid. I think i got
to got everywhere artery. You

80
00:06:29,26 --> 00:06:34,24
walked all the way and then you know all
the way. And then after that you were at

81
00:06:34,24 --> 00:06:39,41
work is complete. I don't really know
of about that. Now whether we've got

82
00:06:39,41 --> 00:06:41,22
compensation or not i
suppose we would have got

83
00:06:41,22 --> 00:06:45,79
a bright forgotten all about that. Now i
don't think any other week with i got to

84
00:06:45,79 --> 00:06:52,63
not work. What do you did you work there
and what we won it was just there in

85
00:06:52,63 --> 00:06:57,51
1931 towards the latter the blocks down
the last of the world. It was time well

86
00:06:57,51 --> 00:07:04,07
workers come came in 1926. I must have got
it but i said do you mean where you live

87
00:07:04,07 --> 00:07:08,63
when you worked in so i lived in places
to call the clubhouse hotels an old hotel

88
00:07:09,71 --> 00:07:10,44
run by mrs.

89
00:07:10,44 --> 00:07:15,95
Keeper and i was in queen street maria.
And how did you get to work where we used

90
00:07:15,95 --> 00:07:17,05
to have cast quarters of

91
00:07:17,05 --> 00:07:23,95
a morning. Take it out and in the
afternoon come out and bring us back and

92
00:07:23,96 --> 00:07:25,38
do you remember the town
of maria and there's

93
00:07:25,38 --> 00:07:32,15
a yes. Not about it or town. But the middle
of it. So tell us about that. I don't

94
00:07:32,15 --> 00:07:34,35
think i would come on is

95
00:07:34,35 --> 00:07:38,44
a long time ago. Now you know i
forgot all about that now was

96
00:07:38,45 --> 00:07:40,42
a good really good happy town you know get

97
00:07:40,42 --> 00:07:44,06
a good time there. Well well
that's all i can tell you

98
00:07:44,06 --> 00:07:49,91
a couple of girls there. Used to go in
the pub there as well. They have dances

99
00:07:49,91 --> 00:07:55,48
there. You know you tap dance at the
quarry. I mean one time i suppose

100
00:07:55,48 --> 00:08:02,27
a fiddle little bit then and with
them to dance placements to come out

101
00:08:02,27 --> 00:08:08,74
there and he has to be there to make
home brewing up there is to make

102
00:08:09,86 --> 00:08:10,26
a bit of

103
00:08:10,26 --> 00:08:13,50
a still out there. I believe i don't know
where it was i had an idea where it was

104
00:08:14,23 --> 00:08:17,16
and i used to come out and i got wind of
an energy to dance with them and only come

105
00:08:17,16 --> 00:08:18,55
out one night you write about

106
00:08:18,55 --> 00:08:24,32
a month after you got him with them. You
remember the quarry workers there where

107
00:08:24,32 --> 00:08:28,24
did they come from and they were scotch
there was no matter what happened. Scotland

108
00:08:28,24 --> 00:08:29,69
. Nearly all the scotch

109
00:08:29,69 --> 00:08:35,65
a few italians and they mostly scotch
they were they were the families where

110
00:08:35,66 --> 00:08:42,05
there's got the families blacksmiths and
all embassy and they were quarryman can

111
00:08:42,05 --> 00:08:44,88
you describe granite turn. Yet it was

112
00:08:44,88 --> 00:08:51,48
a little place out there.
That was just they were all

113
00:08:51,48 --> 00:08:56,83
weatherboard places you know makeshift
places and they're really comfortable they

114
00:08:56,83 --> 00:09:03,36
really really good. Do you make some friends
amongst the scots with a woman. I had

115
00:09:03,36 --> 00:09:09,83
a couple of girlfriends there. Were good
little girls. And you got what do you

116
00:09:09,83 --> 00:09:15,72
remember of the italians. One or two i
didn't i didn't expect them they were like

117
00:09:15,72 --> 00:09:16,11
get a bit of

118
00:09:16,11 --> 00:09:23,39
a fine work on there and his name.
You know andrew someone. They

119
00:09:23,40 --> 00:09:30,30
were all right. Scotch they were the people
next with some sort of people tell me

120
00:09:30,30 --> 00:09:33,84
that the italians were pretty well all
single and it was the scots that brought the

121
00:09:33,84 --> 00:09:38,62
family there they were single most of the
i don't know about like remember back

122
00:09:38,62 --> 00:09:45,13
about four or five italians to remember
any union activity there. Yes. We

123
00:09:45,83 --> 00:09:52,46
. The chap there won't mention
his name was written. And

124
00:09:53,48 --> 00:09:57,73
he is the character of a nice
bloke. And he's working on

125
00:09:57,73 --> 00:10:03,45
a job there one day and this is a bit
slow. So they have to get a bit of

126
00:10:03,45 --> 00:10:07,54
a move on and that's what happened what
they said to him but now. I don't know

127
00:10:07,54 --> 00:10:11,81
where that is right but in the i work in
just opposite him. And they came along

128
00:10:11,81 --> 00:10:16,04
with the crane and took the
job they're working on

129
00:10:16,04 --> 00:10:21,40
a way the way calls are not in the work
and then and cause that caused the strike

130
00:10:22,45 --> 00:10:27,06
and where they stop work
meeting and you know there's

131
00:10:27,07 --> 00:10:31,23
a big bloke the name terry love. Big
wild like we vote for us. He was

132
00:10:31,23 --> 00:10:35,65
a stickler even where this meeting any
civil union rights wouldn't come down put.

133
00:10:36,37 --> 00:10:38,22
So he said take up

134
00:10:38,22 --> 00:10:42,70
a collection send me up to sydney he says
now bring them down so he said. And if i

135
00:10:42,70 --> 00:10:43,60
don't come back. Send me

136
00:10:43,60 --> 00:10:48,34
a bunch of flowers there now that was settled
after that he did come to sydney that

137
00:10:48,34 --> 00:10:52,25
was settled and got the job got
his job back again. But he's

138
00:10:52,25 --> 00:10:57,48
a really good bloke. Yeah that was one bit
of union activity. Do you remember the

139
00:10:57,48 --> 00:11:00,72
working conditions around the place you
have somewhere to have your lunch and

140
00:11:00,72 --> 00:11:04,70
somewhere to have boiler tea and things
like that. You know is happening to the

141
00:11:04,70 --> 00:11:08,92
bank as well we used to work on our job.
You know no there was there were i don't

142
00:11:08,92 --> 00:11:09,12
know there's

143
00:11:09,12 --> 00:11:14,57
a canteen they won't ever used to take me
lunch out. I don't really need canteen

144
00:11:14,57 --> 00:11:17,39
a part they would have been
on the because it was that

145
00:11:17,40 --> 00:11:20,65
a big hole i suppose. Right because i did
on the job the people who live there.

146
00:11:20,65 --> 00:11:25,16
They want to canteen actually. But i don't
remember of one being there. Can you

147
00:11:25,16 --> 00:11:32,04
describe granite town as you member it was
no what the town itself was no different

148
00:11:32,04 --> 00:11:36,20
than any other place only
it was a nice little

149
00:11:36,20 --> 00:11:41,69
a nice position on the side the river the
murray river and they built the houses

150
00:11:41,69 --> 00:11:48,35
place the around the area like
oh that's about all i can

151
00:11:49,25 --> 00:11:51,30
tell you about that there
was a hall was there in

152
00:11:51,30 --> 00:11:55,70
a school and salty and so all their school
i think they used to go. I don't know

153
00:11:55,70 --> 00:11:59,71
whether they used to go to maru school years
just down little school down the year

154
00:11:59,71 --> 00:12:02,32
they did happen. You know like
a little bridge they go under

155
00:12:02,32 --> 00:12:08,30
a bridge i think it was which you get your
supplies from then. Well i used to come

156
00:12:08,30 --> 00:12:15,03
to from sydney i suppose you know days
by boat and but used to run up there and

157
00:12:16,10 --> 00:12:21,79
really one time many lorries going to taze
know they mostly on the ships used to

158
00:12:21,79 --> 00:12:28,61
come to maria. And do you
remember you could you pay. No

159
00:12:30,22 --> 00:12:33,68
i think we used to have to queue up yet.
Care at the office for it. You had your

160
00:12:33,68 --> 00:12:37,01
own office. The little office at
the place i showed you there. As

161
00:12:37,01 --> 00:12:38,16
a matter of fact there's a there's

162
00:12:38,16 --> 00:12:43,98
a lady who works in the office is still
around. I wouldn't know what to name. I

163
00:12:43,99 --> 00:12:49,88
think it's ross i'm not not absolutely
certain you. You'll probably meet her at the

164
00:12:49,88 --> 00:12:56,23
reunion. She will be out of me. Well i
don't know i haven't met her yet i have an

165
00:12:56,23 --> 00:12:57,34
area. I just got

166
00:12:57,34 --> 00:13:04,83
a list. Oh yes on our manager gilmore he

167
00:13:04,84 --> 00:13:07,43
used to live on the other side the river
used to come to us by launch every morning

168
00:13:08,53 --> 00:13:10,50
and back in the pinoy time
even though there really

169
00:13:10,50 --> 00:13:12,68
a good crowd of people
i really i really had

170
00:13:12,68 --> 00:13:17,81
a wonderful time while i was down there. I
enjoyed it. What about the other manager

171
00:13:17,81 --> 00:13:22,97
the stern dressing managers. I can't bring
them back they were all late and felt

172
00:13:22,97 --> 00:13:24,84
a lot of them there to give
you a job saying you got

173
00:13:24,84 --> 00:13:28,52
a job for about four or five days you
might be complete for two weeks on

174
00:13:28,52 --> 00:13:32,26
a one job. So it all depends. That's
why you're trying to come and give me

175
00:13:32,26 --> 00:13:36,87
a sketch of the job you had to do and then
it wouldn't turn out and if you do what

176
00:13:36,87 --> 00:13:39,98
you want the next job. Will
you mean a job one block or

177
00:13:39,98 --> 00:13:46,55
a number of blocks take you. How long it
might be you might be able to turn them

178
00:13:46,55 --> 00:13:47,50
off for a week

179
00:13:47,50 --> 00:13:53,33
a couple of weeks as forty much work within
them. There's 40000 blocks i understand

180
00:13:53,33 --> 00:13:56,16
on that side but if you mean i'm a card on

181
00:13:56,16 --> 00:14:02,79
a few. It was amazing to me how do you
remember how many of you were there were

182
00:14:02,79 --> 00:14:07,66
working in the stands. Just trying to think
last night in the dressing part of it.

183
00:14:09,68 --> 00:14:15,85
I'd say they will. I don't know what i'd
be wrong side of the bout might be about

184
00:14:15,85 --> 00:14:21,56
thirty or forty masons and i
wouldn't be quite sure now but quite

185
00:14:21,56 --> 00:14:24,04
a few where were the rest
of them because i got

186
00:14:24,04 --> 00:14:28,21
a figure of all there as quarryman and all
that they were in the quarry part of it

187
00:14:28,21 --> 00:14:34,06
last. Every day and that seemed to when i'm
going to blast and you know get away up

188
00:14:34,06 --> 00:14:34,68
down

189
00:14:34,68 --> 00:14:40,13
a flight of the sheds where you worked and
pieces of the language from the block

190
00:14:40,13 --> 00:14:44,43
when they blasted the court it was only
just back of the sheds wasn't it. Yeah i'm

191
00:14:44,43 --> 00:14:50,39
trying to shed. Do you remember how
many court i mean there were no i

192
00:14:52,10 --> 00:14:53,93
just taken from guesswork
there may have been about

193
00:14:53,93 --> 00:14:58,71
a dozen and i'd say i don't think i'd be
much more you see i heard that there were

194
00:14:58,71 --> 00:15:02,93
200 or 250 people working at the quarry and
how did they manage to get there. Well

195
00:15:04,32 --> 00:15:11,15
i don't know whether they'd be that
many there may have been but i don't

196
00:15:11,15 --> 00:15:15,39
think they're going to be that many of
them may have been i don't know but their

197
00:15:15,39 --> 00:15:16,52
families and all their might have been

198
00:15:16,52 --> 00:15:19,84
a lot of other jobs they were doing
around i didn't know. Oh well it was

199
00:15:19,84 --> 00:15:23,90
a quarryman and then there was the stone
dressing blokes and whatever who else was

200
00:15:23,90 --> 00:15:27,99
there. Well. Well the little
office i think that about half

201
00:15:27,99 --> 00:15:32,67
a dozen people in there and then the
draftsman there and then they did that you

202
00:15:32,67 --> 00:15:35,69
know with the right of the plane not to
give us get the size of the blocks out of

203
00:15:35,69 --> 00:15:37,69
out there to be done. And they give us

204
00:15:37,69 --> 00:15:43,22
a little sketch on paper and we had better
work from that including that i suppose

205
00:15:43,22 --> 00:15:48,13
it would have been like looking after
machinery part of it at their own power there

206
00:15:48,13 --> 00:15:53,16
. I suppose there could be but i think in

207
00:15:53,16 --> 00:15:55,21
a wrong way back. There.
