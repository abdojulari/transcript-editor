1
00:00:14,39 --> 00:00:16,30
So i came back.

2
00:00:17,03 --> 00:00:21,83
Graham doesn't write me a letter saying
come back for this festival here in the

3
00:00:21,83 --> 00:00:24,83
september festival which he was organiser

4
00:00:25,68 --> 00:00:29,95
and do things with the kids because he was
a lot of stuff going on with children

5
00:00:29,96 --> 00:00:31,88
born and growing up

6
00:00:31,88 --> 00:00:35,74
and so there was a lot of children activity
in the community in the wider community

7
00:00:35,74 --> 00:00:42,58
for all those sort of alternative
in quotes of the. Scene.

8
00:00:42,75 --> 00:00:44,64
So we had a interconnectedness and

9
00:00:44,64 --> 00:00:49,28
and still doing our social
interacting experimented

10
00:00:50,92 --> 00:00:56,26
and he came up with the idea of why he had
all this pain in his head like got all

11
00:00:56,26 --> 00:00:58,52
these papers nobody want to
paint the faith ards right.

12
00:00:59,79 --> 00:01:02,01
So i said oh i just looked at it

13
00:01:02,01 --> 00:01:05,43
and i had ideas of you know thing
bubbles drifting across the roof and.

14
00:01:05,95 --> 00:01:10,61
You know i think. Oh yeah
well you know right.

15
00:01:10,86 --> 00:01:13,64
You know because i've never done i never
dumb yours before they were just done

16
00:01:13,64 --> 00:01:16,61
canvases but bigger but
i knew i could do it.

17
00:01:17,43 --> 00:01:23,02
That would be done things a large
scale of these things. Anyway.

18
00:01:23,13 --> 00:01:25,22
No one believes that. You know.

19
00:01:25,46 --> 00:01:29,62
Go for it but and also we didn't
know only the only places

20
00:01:29,62 --> 00:01:33,06
that i started off with was the places
that were already. Alternative.

21
00:01:33,42 --> 00:01:34,47
But i did it.

22
00:01:34,59 --> 00:01:37,09
I decided to do it really well and try

23
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:42,12
and get everybody excited about joining up
the whole to unite the town so i did it

24
00:01:42,12 --> 00:01:44,27
as an exercise to unite the town visually

25
00:01:45,83 --> 00:01:49,10
and i sort of put a lot of energy out there
was a little psychic any good i thought

26
00:01:49,10 --> 00:01:50,97
that was because i i thought in terms of.

27
00:01:51,62 --> 00:01:58,42
Of it's the outreach the global
outreach the whole effort. Behind.

28
00:01:58,65 --> 00:02:03,51
Connecting our. I know this is
this idealist i was mad idea.

29
00:02:03,53 --> 00:02:08,14
And it's and i don't see myself as a mad
ideals i see that we are connected.

30
00:02:08,42 --> 00:02:12,58
Even though people shun
it. Action-reaction.

31
00:02:12,59 --> 00:02:16,47
We affecting the environ we live
on a planet earth which is.

32
00:02:16,49 --> 00:02:20,89
A living thing in the keeps us alive
and we've got to interact with it

33
00:02:20,89 --> 00:02:22,98
and whatever and one
another to keep it alive.

34
00:02:24,18 --> 00:02:27,91
Hopefully it'll get around
to that awareness all over.

35
00:02:28,88 --> 00:02:31,58
And so i just got this.

36
00:02:32,54 --> 00:02:36,29
You know i had this idea of
society in terms of different.

37
00:02:36,78 --> 00:02:39,56
That we drift and we come
together and we drift apart

38
00:02:39,56 --> 00:02:42,86
and yet this is how how things are

39
00:02:42,86 --> 00:02:48,66
and the universe in hard to conceive of
the universe in terms of of imagery of

40
00:02:48,67 --> 00:02:51,71
these orbs that float around because
they have a solar system looks to me

41
00:02:51,71 --> 00:02:53,87
that was my information.

42
00:02:53,89 --> 00:02:57,94
On it so i just thought of that
and that space but so developing

43
00:02:57,94 --> 00:03:00,37
that same idea did in the early stage

44
00:03:00,37 --> 00:03:03,48
and i thought this is a great way to do it
sort of having shaped cameras as i do it

45
00:03:03,48 --> 00:03:09,14
over the fess up. I can really work. The
idea and i want to go an opportunity.

46
00:03:09,30 --> 00:03:13,65
So i know i just i put a lot of
energy and just going from and

47
00:03:14,57 --> 00:03:17,98
and getting these ideas and
i did have quite a idea.

48
00:03:18,02 --> 00:03:22,90
I ended up actually doing a whole street
strip from one in the town right to be

49
00:03:22,90 --> 00:03:24,32
other with that.

50
00:03:25,49 --> 00:03:27,23
Oh well with not just
with the bubbles drifting

51
00:03:27,23 --> 00:03:28,56
and sort of move from the bubbles

52
00:03:28,56 --> 00:03:32,69
and i have papered it off with the bubbles
going off in the flame over the emporium

53
00:03:32,69 --> 00:03:35,96
which doesn't exist now and
then i went on the rainforest

54
00:03:35,96 --> 00:03:39,14
and then onto a quiet meditation
onto the healing center.

55
00:03:40,06 --> 00:03:41,38
So it's a sort of came after.

56
00:03:43,02 --> 00:03:43,95
Just thinking about

57
00:03:45,38 --> 00:03:48,39
and the people letting me do it because
i because they said i looked good.

58
00:03:48,50 --> 00:03:52,59
You know they're going to the concept at
first it was resistance because it was

59
00:03:52,59 --> 00:03:54,14
resistance to.

60
00:03:54,85 --> 00:03:55,81
Some of the people there

61
00:03:55,81 --> 00:03:59,92
but i sort of want to over by saying
what you get into if you be part i do.

62
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,26
Whole thing on the newsagent's was the
hardest one because that's was like the

63
00:04:05,26 --> 00:04:11,18
national party sort of supporters
there around the newsagents and but.

64
00:04:12,79 --> 00:04:17,70
I talked to the woman there so you conceived
of their picture taken of having their

65
00:04:17,70 --> 00:04:20,96
picture. You know. Up there
and do anything glasses

66
00:04:20,96 --> 00:04:24,77
and all everybody you know happy family.
And i had them right up the front.

67
00:04:24,97 --> 00:04:28,40
You know right. You know and i thought all
right. And i thought it was interesting.

68
00:04:28,47 --> 00:04:30,60
They look the quality within you

69
00:04:30,61 --> 00:04:32,69
and how it was the whole place
look pretty shoddy up there

70
00:04:32,69 --> 00:04:36,24
but the kind of paint would
have done it good. Anyway.

71
00:04:36,26 --> 00:04:41,50
So that's our got away whether it's
actually because nobody was really doing

72
00:04:41,51 --> 00:04:46,13
anything up there and there
was nothing much. It was.

73
00:04:48,43 --> 00:04:51,24
You know things at least i'm
giving it a coat of paint

74
00:04:51,24 --> 00:04:53,03
and they showed him the idea

75
00:04:53,03 --> 00:05:02,51
and the idea didn't look terribly
controversial it would be interesting to see.

76
00:05:02,52 --> 00:05:05,08
I was different styles i
just sort of developed.

77
00:05:05,12 --> 00:05:11,75
I just went along and just tidied
up my style. Basically i worked on.

78
00:05:12,66 --> 00:05:16,82
A very simple style which
was hard edge flat colour.

79
00:05:16,99 --> 00:05:21,94
So all even the 3d effect was
created by you know two tone.

80
00:05:21,96 --> 00:05:24,01
Two tone effects.

81
00:05:24,03 --> 00:05:28,09
So it's just flat colour there's no shading
it's just actually just flat colour

82
00:05:28,09 --> 00:05:33,20
but i mixed the colours and i got so worked
off that it was an easy way to design.

83
00:05:33,26 --> 00:05:39,41
So when i gritted up. I knew where
the where i. The areas to paint in.

84
00:05:39,88 --> 00:05:44,75
So i just was it was a matter of painting
an area then you could put in shading

85
00:05:44,75 --> 00:05:47,88
and that i think strong works i was
a big job so i kept it as minimal

86
00:05:47,88 --> 00:05:54,35
and is easy and other people can help the
paint in that sort of see just filling.

87
00:05:54,36 --> 00:05:58,24
Areas of colour from design grid up.

88
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,03
Well was over two year period
of that sort of that that.

89
00:06:04,62 --> 00:06:08,14
That's full of activity of
sort of stream of activity

90
00:06:08,14 --> 00:06:14,93
when i went overseas to look at public
art in other places in the united states

91
00:06:14,93 --> 00:06:19,33
actually.

92
00:06:24,55 --> 00:06:29,18
Yeah well that actually developed after
when i after i finished a mural.

93
00:06:30,11 --> 00:06:33,47
Dollar man you know that's another
sort of character that developed.

94
00:06:35,33 --> 00:06:37,44
Well actually often as a
witness only bubbles because

95
00:06:37,44 --> 00:06:40,03
that whole concert was all
part of a total concept

96
00:06:40,03 --> 00:06:45,03
and they only bubbles actually had a was
sort of appearing disappear was sort of

97
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:49,63
and it become a ritual it
became a ritual. Performer.

98
00:06:49,76 --> 00:06:54,23
I used it in which a performer got
this as a as a ritual. Leader.

99
00:06:54,41 --> 00:06:57,20
You know ritual centerpiece
or ritual shaman

100
00:06:58,53 --> 00:07:03,93
and where we did so i did a series of
solstice events of the seasons and

101
00:07:04,93 --> 00:07:09,47
and so and they were all related
to that sort of circular

102
00:07:10,37 --> 00:07:15,71
and spatial relationship i
did a. Thing here. Of fire.

103
00:07:16,08 --> 00:07:19,74
Fire ritual i was with
the community and so we.

104
00:07:19,94 --> 00:07:26,57
Concentric circles of 12 balls of
fire things like that but i use

105
00:07:26,57 --> 00:07:30,41
that cos he became i've became
more than just that i had a cape

106
00:07:30,41 --> 00:07:34,50
and i did all this illusionary stuff
so i developed a whole dance theater.

107
00:07:34,54 --> 00:07:37,91
I could do on my own from the injury
a little alone doing workshops

108
00:07:37,91 --> 00:07:40,10
and just doing just dancing with people

109
00:07:40,10 --> 00:07:44,69
and developing my vocabulary of movement
with people like cavalier relating to

110
00:07:44,69 --> 00:07:48,06
community dancing and
interactor in contact and.

111
00:07:48,57 --> 00:07:53,32
All that sort of the you
know this developing.

112
00:07:54,16 --> 00:07:59,55
You know the developing processes
in in. In our sensory.

113
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,42
By billy interaction and movement
and ourselves individually.

114
00:08:03,93 --> 00:08:04,90
So that was part of that

115
00:08:04,90 --> 00:08:09,05
that was sort of a yogic seem like i had
this personal thing which had spots

116
00:08:09,05 --> 00:08:10,57
and that i was a focus on
the take it out anyway.

117
00:08:10,85 --> 00:08:15,17
I could do these events and express
myself in mind you know with that

118
00:08:15,17 --> 00:08:21,79
and just give a as a
springboard to express ideas.

119
00:08:22,87 --> 00:08:24,41
You know. So a good idea. So for me.

120
00:08:25,90 --> 00:08:32,43
It was part of that it that tension
getting attention. And then.

121
00:08:32,46 --> 00:08:35,29
Well dollar man grew out
of after that sort of

122
00:08:36,31 --> 00:08:40,30
that sort of it was very much involved
with healing process as well.

123
00:08:41,39 --> 00:08:42,20
Dance my dance

124
00:08:42,20 --> 00:08:47,58
and the movement i was very much became
part of my as a healer in the community

125
00:08:48,48 --> 00:08:48,50
and

126
00:08:48,50 --> 00:08:52,09
that was this whole process of aquarius was
developing those skills for healing in

127
00:08:52,09 --> 00:08:56,28
actual fact and. So you.

128
00:08:56,63 --> 00:09:01,21
You know sort of community getting
together was healing and.

129
00:09:01,23 --> 00:09:04,76
Well i traveled overseas with and and.

130
00:09:05,30 --> 00:09:10,20
And my first stop was in los angeles at
the world symposium on humanities which

131
00:09:10,20 --> 00:09:15,24
john allen said attend this is
important event and because

132
00:09:15,24 --> 00:09:18,11
that was the thinkers around the world.

133
00:09:18,42 --> 00:09:24,64
Congregating in different areas
around the world and i was the.

134
00:09:25,60 --> 00:09:28,26
There was this the passage in a
scene it was in our in a way

135
00:09:28,26 --> 00:09:31,89
and there was the stadium.

136
00:09:32,06 --> 00:09:36,06
Wimbley stadium in england
it was another thing

137
00:09:36,06 --> 00:09:39,37
and it was in toronto
at trying to university

138
00:09:39,37 --> 00:09:42,89
and they have to move around because it
was government so they were freaking out

139
00:09:42,89 --> 00:09:47,43
towards the end because look like because
it was really challenging the status quo

140
00:09:47,43 --> 00:09:52,80
cassette they also had a. T.v. Link up.
That was going to go on all around.

141
00:09:54,26 --> 00:09:57,35
That's when satellite started
to happen satellite t.v.

142
00:09:57,35 --> 00:09:59,47
and It was booked satellite
to be to link into.

143
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,81
Networks around what about this conference

144
00:10:03,04 --> 00:10:07,00
and cause governments pull the plug on them
all over this whole thing was sabotaged

145
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:09,85
by governments the actual.

146
00:10:09,87 --> 00:10:12,59
You know i don't think video
and in toronto they try to do

147
00:10:13,42 --> 00:10:16,74
that they moved in
officials moved in to try

148
00:10:16,74 --> 00:10:20,12
and close close down the
university there and the l.a.

149
00:10:20,12 --> 00:10:23,87
One got off with a lot of
difficulty the wembley stadium one.

150
00:10:24,25 --> 00:10:27,00
Just got off i don't know they
had problems there was last

151
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:30,39
and last minute they got to go meet for
there was problems with management the

152
00:10:30,39 --> 00:10:32,72
government pulled out or satchel was in

153
00:10:32,72 --> 00:10:38,14
and she was creating you know
sort of within down the line.

154
00:10:38,16 --> 00:10:41,88
Anyway the world symposium was really
discussing all these things we're talking

155
00:10:41,88 --> 00:10:45,85
about the military complex and the
problems and the health and healing

156
00:10:45,85 --> 00:10:50,08
and the indigenous
peoples all these things

157
00:10:50,08 --> 00:10:54,06
that relating to today that's
becoming more and more.

158
00:10:54,08 --> 00:10:58,81
You know you now becoming mainstream
and where is mainstream now

159
00:10:58,81 --> 00:11:03,31
that discussion this is the way to go like
to heal the wounds with with the people

160
00:11:03,31 --> 00:11:06,43
that were on this country they were forced

161
00:11:07,18 --> 00:11:12,66
or forced by a military culture that's
all imperialist cultures and all that

162
00:11:13,67 --> 00:11:17,01
and from and the whole culture
that was here with birth related

163
00:11:17,01 --> 00:11:18,58
and connected with the earth

164
00:11:18,58 --> 00:11:23,27
and this awareness was sort
of becoming more among people

165
00:11:23,28 --> 00:11:26,19
that congregate in these spots
around the place and the healing

166
00:11:26,19 --> 00:11:28,65
and so it was like a query a festival.

167
00:11:29,22 --> 00:11:35,74
10 years after but now held in
conference forums with thinkers without

168
00:11:35,74 --> 00:11:39,37
and we had the music that take place and
this ritual but it was held in a sort of.

169
00:11:39,90 --> 00:11:45,23
You know try to be a mainstream event
it was a mainstream event. So that.

170
00:11:45,86 --> 00:11:46,69
Government people

171
00:11:46,69 --> 00:11:50,04
and people the mainstream rather than the
see people out in the field doing it.

172
00:11:52,22 --> 00:11:53,74
And using computers

173
00:11:53,74 --> 00:11:59,38
and technology using all of sort of you
know state of the art sort of technology.

174
00:11:59,39 --> 00:12:01,59
It was a veil. All just
came on the scene so

175
00:12:01,59 --> 00:12:04,74
that was the age of personal computers.

176
00:12:04,75 --> 00:12:11,59
And just just came on the scene
then there was in 89. 79.

177
00:12:11,69 --> 00:12:15,73
Sorry seventy nine was
the. Just before the 80s.

178
00:12:15,76 --> 00:12:20,67
You know the gateway to the 80s
and i was let's look at this era

179
00:12:20,67 --> 00:12:22,79
that we're just going through
with yet now and it was just

180
00:12:22,79 --> 00:12:29,14
and also the nuclear power station
in three mile island just blew up.

181
00:12:29,54 --> 00:12:32,04
Well nearly blew up you
know so there was that

182
00:12:32,84 --> 00:12:39,89
and so there was a big movement towards
having this this these forums.

183
00:12:40,78 --> 00:12:46,08
And so there was a whole people simple
then i was there was a lot of learning.

184
00:12:46,37 --> 00:12:49,35
I made the connection with pallas alarie.

185
00:12:49,37 --> 00:12:50,16
Aka sante

186
00:12:50,16 --> 00:12:56,25
and that's whole the whole idea of
permaculture city which he had going then

187
00:12:57,27 --> 00:13:01,34
called an archaeology process so
moved on from frank lloyd wright.

188
00:13:01,37 --> 00:13:05,78
That's another story and that and.

189
00:13:06,64 --> 00:13:11,24
And i then took part then the whole
nuclear issue became i became aware helen

190
00:13:11,24 --> 00:13:17,49
caldicott was there was there and there was
ralph nader and i spoke to ralph nader.

191
00:13:17,79 --> 00:13:19,55
After one of his talks

192
00:13:19,55 --> 00:13:23,09
and he said well the best way you can
get in touch with people is one to one.

193
00:13:24,51 --> 00:13:26,34
Talk about all these little
trying to x and this and

194
00:13:26,34 --> 00:13:30,74
that this is great if there's one
thing one so that's stuck in my mind

195
00:13:30,74 --> 00:13:33,22
and he's raised stuck and
i he does talk and i.

196
00:13:33,49 --> 00:13:36,75
I picked up the tapes from
what was taking place there.

197
00:13:37,80 --> 00:13:38,99
And in the nuclear issue was

198
00:13:38,99 --> 00:13:42,53
when i got back to australia the
nuke issue was was a big issue

199
00:13:42,53 --> 00:13:44,05
and the aboriginal issue.

200
00:13:46,33 --> 00:13:49,42
With a lot of things happen america won't
go on because the whole story in itself

201
00:13:49,42 --> 00:13:55,81
my journey through the whole public art
and was involved with the. With no nukes.

202
00:13:55,83 --> 00:13:59,74
No nukes event in. Three
mile. Not that in ny.

203
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,15
When new york was a whole
month of alternative energy.

204
00:14:03,17 --> 00:14:05,90
It was quite progressive
like there was tours

205
00:14:05,90 --> 00:14:09,88
and electric buses going
around to alternative things

206
00:14:09,88 --> 00:14:11,92
that are happening in new york city and

207
00:14:11,93 --> 00:14:14,32
that was going on then there
was a whole plan of action

208
00:14:15,47 --> 00:14:19,78
when you with the no nukes
concerts on took place on the.

209
00:14:20,76 --> 00:14:22,71
Which was recorded with all these stars

210
00:14:22,71 --> 00:14:24,41
and it was a whole movement from hollywood

211
00:14:25,50 --> 00:14:29,58
and around the country coming to new
york or sort of on the road journey

212
00:14:29,58 --> 00:14:35,51
and i came to new york with this big
month of event. Months of events and.

213
00:14:36,25 --> 00:14:41,79
That all technological fair of
alternatives to. Direct action.

214
00:14:42,06 --> 00:14:45,07
And then there was you know
stopping wall street and.

215
00:14:45,36 --> 00:14:49,62
And getting in touch with all the new
call it quits the weapon groups and all

216
00:14:49,62 --> 00:14:50,45
that but the whole thing was.

217
00:14:50,95 --> 00:14:54,79
The whole link of the nuclear power
anything with the weapons in this tree.

218
00:14:55,48 --> 00:14:58,56
And how it's it's really dangerous.

219
00:14:59,04 --> 00:15:01,01
You know really bad news

220
00:15:01,01 --> 00:15:05,80
but alone it's the cold war is
creating real real problems in.

221
00:15:06,02 --> 00:15:10,67
It just the whole military industry
and this was going to hold madness

222
00:15:11,54 --> 00:15:15,95
that we need peace and not
war and nuchal ip nuclear.

223
00:15:17,13 --> 00:15:21,17
The nuclear stuff was showing its evil
rearing its nuclear head with the three mile

224
00:15:21,17 --> 00:15:23,75
island accident and a lot of
people on the road anyway.

225
00:15:24,30 --> 00:15:30,11
So i decided to be part of that to help
with it. I didn't have a dollar man there.

226
00:15:30,72 --> 00:15:33,01
That was sort of happening
later on because at

227
00:15:33,01 --> 00:15:36,69
that stage i was just there helping
and just giving out leaflets and.

228
00:15:37,06 --> 00:15:40,60
I was there as a visitor. And
when i came back to australia.

229
00:15:42,56 --> 00:15:45,28
There was a new cumber and so
i was with a sort of help.

230
00:15:45,83 --> 00:15:51,89
Help that it did a flag for big
aboriginal flag that was up.

231
00:15:52,60 --> 00:15:55,38
There was 1980. At st.

232
00:15:55,38 --> 00:15:56,89
Paul's cathedral so i was there

233
00:15:56,89 --> 00:15:59,80
and i had the workshops developed
i still was working on dance.

234
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,55
I was involved dance all the time.

235
00:16:01,62 --> 00:16:05,61
Dance and murals that whole concert
with the bubble still developing.

236
00:16:07,04 --> 00:16:13,71
With planet of us now and into the public.
I think all are still developing and.

237
00:16:14,76 --> 00:16:21,27
So the. So then after
nukem after that one.

238
00:16:21,39 --> 00:16:25,10
You know was direct action and street
event and also observe street theater.

239
00:16:25,40 --> 00:16:31,83
In america and. And i had in my
mind implicit certain images.

240
00:16:34,41 --> 00:16:39,40
So i didn't know where i was going
there because i still was in to dance

241
00:16:39,40 --> 00:16:40,23
and murals

242
00:16:40,23 --> 00:16:44,18
and healing as a really important thing to
like the way i was going was really good

243
00:16:44,18 --> 00:16:45,58
like that positive

244
00:16:46,41 --> 00:16:50,46
but it sort of started to dawn on me with
our oversight of my abs observational

245
00:16:50,46 --> 00:16:53,85
direct action on wall street
that wall street action.

246
00:16:54,13 --> 00:16:58,86
Sort of 50 years since wall street collapsed
i tried to create the same scenario.

247
00:16:58,88 --> 00:17:00,71
I have. Over the.

248
00:17:02,43 --> 00:17:06,11
Over the nuclear to stop whole street to
stop wall street over the whole newcome

249
00:17:06,11 --> 00:17:10,94
industry and do no nukes and i came back.

250
00:17:11,27 --> 00:17:13,12
Cut the story short i came back

251
00:17:14,07 --> 00:17:18,47
and i was i heard after newcombe
i heard about the middle head

252
00:17:18,47 --> 00:17:22,96
and it was a healing festival and
that and the solstice and that.

253
00:17:22,97 --> 00:17:29,42
I was into rituals and. And
healing and so forth but.

254
00:17:29,43 --> 00:17:32,17
When i got got there i heard the story

255
00:17:32,17 --> 00:17:36,00
that the bulldozers were coming in any
me any pick up a clock to clear this

256
00:17:36,00 --> 00:17:38,42
beautiful beach you know
and people meditating

257
00:17:38,42 --> 00:17:42,80
and doing you know going to have a strong
with a great importance the aboriginal

258
00:17:42,80 --> 00:17:46,81
people middle head and
terrain you just happened.

259
00:17:46,93 --> 00:17:50,48
The year before and i was
connected with the terrain you

260
00:17:50,48 --> 00:17:55,09
and you from corresponds i was at no
nukes concerts while touraine you was

261
00:17:55,09 --> 00:17:59,68
happening. So there was following. Saran
yeah. So it keyed into that sort of.

262
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,68
Movement.

263
00:18:01,70 --> 00:18:05,40
Even though i haven't been arrested
before this was my first the rest of the

264
00:18:05,40 --> 00:18:09,54
situation i found like a little head and.

265
00:18:10,95 --> 00:18:14,71
So there i really started.

266
00:18:14,86 --> 00:18:19,68
I don't know what sort of like i was i was
it really got to me i just start seeing

267
00:18:19,68 --> 00:18:21,34
machineries as monsters.

268
00:18:21,78 --> 00:18:27,61
It actually got to me like a naughty
feel for people and the authorities

269
00:18:27,61 --> 00:18:31,24
and how we isolated the media
slanting that was going on.

270
00:18:31,47 --> 00:18:33,39
You know making us with
a bunch of terrorists.

271
00:18:33,72 --> 00:18:37,93
All we had was that the whole people
occupying an area and asking questions

272
00:18:37,93 --> 00:18:39,42
that hey you know hold it

273
00:18:40,27 --> 00:18:45,43
and you know this is not sort of devastate
this beautiful area this is very rare

274
00:18:47,50 --> 00:18:53,21
and course we were put in a position where
we were pitted against these machines.

275
00:18:53,23 --> 00:18:55,15
And the operators of the machines

276
00:18:55,15 --> 00:18:57,92
and the machine people could
so i could see the sea

277
00:18:57,92 --> 00:19:02,38
and i was into a long stint of meditation.

278
00:19:02,40 --> 00:19:08,35
After they waylaid the first sortie
while there was the first sortie

279
00:19:08,35 --> 00:19:09,53
and then i got arrested in

280
00:19:09,53 --> 00:19:14,98
that sortie of the forest because i saw
100 trees grow we have this regard very

281
00:19:14,98 --> 00:19:18,59
sensitive to the trees and because
singing to me. I mean i had this.

282
00:19:18,88 --> 00:19:21,38
I was something something was going on.

283
00:19:21,63 --> 00:19:25,39
You know i don't know what it was
but i could hear the voices.

284
00:19:25,41 --> 00:19:28,61
And things i was sort of
spun out i could see the.

285
00:19:29,20 --> 00:19:31,08
Because i did a lot of
meditation and yoga.

286
00:19:31,42 --> 00:19:33,31
That's developing that time

287
00:19:34,50 --> 00:19:37,96
and all of a sudden this sort of other
thing was coming to me it is no answer.

288
00:19:38,26 --> 00:19:42,06
I mean i'm not into sort of saying
that god spoke to me but i was

289
00:19:42,06 --> 00:19:44,73
or something like that and then sort
of like all the sudden i just hearing

290
00:19:44,73 --> 00:19:49,80
that crying out there is something
you know and and the birds and

291
00:19:50,82 --> 00:19:54,60
and dead birds on the ground and the whole
nature was in disarray i could see it.

292
00:19:54,60 --> 00:19:59,93
I was sitting among it. And we were in there
and a lot of maggi was a lot of meat.

293
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:00,85
We with the people there

294
00:20:00,85 --> 00:20:04,31
and i mean there was a certain feeling a
certain things were happening manifesting

295
00:20:04,31 --> 00:20:08,61
and you just felt there was a certain
strength even though wolf you were very

296
00:20:08,61 --> 00:20:12,14
strong and very powerful people
in a burning burning coming up

297
00:20:12,14 --> 00:20:15,78
and you know we had the indigenous
people and that was very special because

298
00:20:16,99 --> 00:20:19,39
that was becoming aware of
the indigenous culture and

299
00:20:19,39 --> 00:20:21,61
and how you know listen to them

300
00:20:21,61 --> 00:20:26,58
and in the come from the primal roots they
actually indigenous people have primal

301
00:20:26,58 --> 00:20:27,97
roots go right back. Of.

302
00:20:28,27 --> 00:20:32,63
Before we became inventors of
and trying to think we are god

303
00:20:32,63 --> 00:20:33,51
and change the world

304
00:20:33,51 --> 00:20:36,64
that we actually part of nature they who
are living with nature back in those days

305
00:20:36,64 --> 00:20:42,25
and civilization crippen's i was
aware of that sort of connection and

306
00:20:42,25 --> 00:20:47,35
and aboriginal people of this
aboriginal awareness from

307
00:20:47,35 --> 00:20:51,56
that nuba absence of was there and then
it was when your record's coming up.

308
00:20:53,22 --> 00:20:54,26
And again. Graeme dallas

309
00:20:54,26 --> 00:20:57,44
and sort of flew in said graham doesn't
actually have a great influence.

310
00:20:58,16 --> 00:21:01,88
I mean a lot of people have a lot of
flack on him but actually he's my hero.

311
00:21:02,15 --> 00:21:08,16
One of my here. Because the actual fact
he sort of triggered me off another way.

312
00:21:08,19 --> 00:21:13,01
I mean he also you know sort of triggered
off ego type things as well like exhort

313
00:21:13,01 --> 00:21:15,08
where did things it was a good
critic i mean he's a critic.

314
00:21:16,30 --> 00:21:18,65
You know writes and critics
and he stirs up stuff

315
00:21:18,65 --> 00:21:24,37
but he is is good because he stirs up this
stuff to really bring out. Real issues.

316
00:21:25,25 --> 00:21:31,24
You know question of you know and for
change. So members on the beach.

317
00:21:31,26 --> 00:21:32,75
I was wondering so what
are you going to do.

318
00:21:32,78 --> 00:21:37,55
Benny that basically does all this is
happening because i wasn't prepared for us.

319
00:21:37,64 --> 00:21:41,91
I was still into this thing you know so
doing yoga meditation doing circles.

320
00:21:43,01 --> 00:21:45,78
You know all these things
or sort of appeasing.

321
00:21:46,49 --> 00:21:49,81
People sort of you know sort of crawling.

322
00:21:50,47 --> 00:21:53,55
To say hey you know it is that this
is the way you go and i think not so.

323
00:21:53,61 --> 00:21:55,40
Seeing that we actually
are dealing with it.

324
00:21:55,45 --> 00:22:00,28
Evil situation a situation of people
don't want to change fear. Inch.

325
00:22:00,52 --> 00:22:03,23
Well you know they're true
intransient and that's hip and.

326
00:22:03,58 --> 00:22:06,98
And i just go through it. Then you know
they won't listen to anything else.

327
00:22:07,97 --> 00:22:09,86
They won't listen to that side of it.

328
00:22:09,95 --> 00:22:14,50
So i want to shock them you know i mean we
needed to do something dramatic you know

329
00:22:14,50 --> 00:22:15,55
i just have to sit

330
00:22:15,55 --> 00:22:18,58
and meditate i mean i wanted to i
didn't like to to really create

331
00:22:18,58 --> 00:22:20,82
that sort of i don't know what to do.

332
00:22:21,82 --> 00:22:22,26
At that so

333
00:22:22,26 --> 00:22:27,04
and then if it was set up as a recycling
theatre type idea to do actions.

334
00:22:28,24 --> 00:22:29,89
Input of course and i
just came out of jail

335
00:22:30,75 --> 00:22:32,59
and we weren't allowed to
get back into the area

336
00:22:33,34 --> 00:22:35,14
and so we were actually we
would have been caught.

337
00:22:35,19 --> 00:22:37,03
We would have been in trouble so was
all these sort of come together

338
00:22:37,03 --> 00:22:40,28
and came up with a concept we put
on masks and we did these action

339
00:22:41,22 --> 00:22:44,32
but we had enough they would know who we
work with if they were being identified we

340
00:22:44,32 --> 00:22:48,52
would have been arrested so so
so we made masks and things

341
00:22:48,52 --> 00:22:53,28
but so i started i created a recycling camp
after grammar so what are you going to

342
00:22:53,28 --> 00:22:56,60
do so i decide to do that and learn
about it was talking about doing this.

343
00:22:56,94 --> 00:23:00,14
And idea of doing a crucifix.

344
00:23:00,16 --> 00:23:04,26
You know like this sort of a crucifix idea
of because we only had one way of going

345
00:23:04,26 --> 00:23:07,82
to the beach. You know all the rest of
us forest and all guarded by police.

346
00:23:07,84 --> 00:23:11,23
All the way down so we sort of created
that into that the police being

347
00:23:11,23 --> 00:23:14,91
that the sense durians and
we set up these crises

348
00:23:14,91 --> 00:23:20,84
and one was was different was we had three
crises one one was for a woman was a

349
00:23:20,84 --> 00:23:23,21
woman on it and we had a.

350
00:23:23,22 --> 00:23:28,06
And i was a hippie and i was aboriginal
so we had a sort of as a chris a fight

351
00:23:28,06 --> 00:23:32,75
and it was all built out of this out
these cruises we made out of the trees

352
00:23:32,75 --> 00:23:36,04
that were way late and we did
this one of the action and i mean

353
00:23:36,04 --> 00:23:37,60
when we sank down by the water.

354
00:23:37,60 --> 00:23:44,35
It was a whole production and was filmed
by by by an a b c excite a b c guy.

355
00:23:45,40 --> 00:23:48,63
Which is name and i think it's in his name

356
00:23:49,46 --> 00:23:51,46
but he filmed it because
no media would turn up.

357
00:23:51,57 --> 00:23:54,61
He was a person there with a
super 8 and he'd just filmed it.

358
00:23:54,67 --> 00:23:59,33
Remember that action was really
significant. So i set up that camp to help.

359
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:03,35
And it's just that this project that
they all came together all at once.

360
00:24:03,44 --> 00:24:05,28
I guess was this group mind.

361
00:24:05,34 --> 00:24:10,89
There was an aboriginal embassy there to
the embassy from canberra move to middle

362
00:24:10,89 --> 00:24:14,70
head for the actual that they were
kicked off or something happened

363
00:24:14,70 --> 00:24:16,14
and they moved to middle here

364
00:24:16,14 --> 00:24:18,98
and i didn't think they were kicked off
they just sort of moved to middle head

365
00:24:18,98 --> 00:24:23,34
decided i don't know what happened
yet but i moved a little head.

366
00:24:23,74 --> 00:24:26,02
So there.

367
00:24:27,20 --> 00:24:31,58
Well enough meditation i had these goals
and you know these things came up in

368
00:24:31,58 --> 00:24:37,76
and sort of and degree days and
and sort of like is about greed

369
00:24:37,76 --> 00:24:42,22
and i saw these monsters and i sort of
agreed oser and company was about greed

370
00:24:42,22 --> 00:24:42,43
and

371
00:24:42,43 --> 00:24:46,24
that sort of just hit onto me this idea of
the doe's earn the green i thought i was

372
00:24:46,24 --> 00:24:52,02
a concept i put together for greedo then
companies so out of recycled plastic and.

373
00:24:52,68 --> 00:24:57,60
And. And cardboard make greed doesn't
come and so was the first stage

374
00:24:57,60 --> 00:25:02,27
that was that's the first stage of
that development and then you know

375
00:25:02,27 --> 00:25:05,54
that fell apart and i developed a bit
with paper mâché in a grew and then.

376
00:25:06,09 --> 00:25:09,90
As i went down around actions i developed
that costume as part of doing banners

377
00:25:09,90 --> 00:25:10,55
and flags

378
00:25:10,55 --> 00:25:14,61
and all the rest of it for actions i
developed my own theatre piece my own.

379
00:25:15,03 --> 00:25:19,59
Expression which would be a sort of the
shtick ghost will appear because we're

380
00:25:19,59 --> 00:25:21,09
doing ghost actions.

381
00:25:21,54 --> 00:25:25,36
With these sort of dark at night
would come in and sort of move in

382
00:25:25,36 --> 00:25:29,46
and do these sort of you know
do actions with our cost

383
00:25:29,46 --> 00:25:31,45
and so sort of an idea

384
00:25:32,58 --> 00:25:37,74
and it was anger involved with it
at the time and now it's changed.

385
00:25:37,80 --> 00:25:38,58
No not anger

386
00:25:38,58 --> 00:25:45,21
but actually sort of developed as i
developed it became sort of i mean there's

387
00:25:45,21 --> 00:25:49,00
anger but now it's sort of like
hey can't you see what it's about

388
00:25:49,00 --> 00:25:53,29
and we want to just sort of just get into
changing you know for that sort of thing.

389
00:25:53,33 --> 00:25:58,93
It's all these are most mixed reactions
go on. But that's not sort of aim to.

390
00:25:59,26 --> 00:26:03,25
To justice. Plan but it's actually
sort of to help with enlightenment

391
00:26:03,25 --> 00:26:07,47
and lightening people for changes
and so if i take them around

392
00:26:07,47 --> 00:26:11,81
and it's sort of the media pick up on it
really well you know i'm going to god i'm

393
00:26:11,81 --> 00:26:16,18
really good. I'm a good. Good
produce projecting my body.

394
00:26:16,19 --> 00:26:19,86
With the images and the whole
you know just i just practice.

395
00:26:19,88 --> 00:26:25,26
Rehearse it every time i do
it is another rehearsal.

396
00:26:27,07 --> 00:26:30,66
In the movement. Yeah i know
that i've developed a develop

397
00:26:30,66 --> 00:26:34,44
that i was sort of deliberate
development of an icon without.

398
00:26:34,45 --> 00:26:38,02
Spelling it out just doing it you know
just so i just throw myself into the.

399
00:26:38,53 --> 00:26:40,94
Into you know help create the theatre

400
00:26:40,94 --> 00:26:45,92
and then it's just a little piece
myself like everything set up and it's.

401
00:26:45,94 --> 00:26:48,31
Demy number and and when i get arrested.

402
00:26:48,55 --> 00:26:48,85
I use

403
00:26:48,85 --> 00:26:56,77
that as part of the early hours of play with
the with everything around me to create.

404
00:26:57,85 --> 00:27:00,16
Just so that when when
they when the shutter goes

405
00:27:00,16 --> 00:27:04,28
that sort of you get a as if
you've got these totally images.

406
00:27:05,46 --> 00:27:09,98
And they can use it and just hope the media
will use it and some do and some don't.

407
00:27:10,09 --> 00:27:11,16
It all depends and some.

408
00:27:11,52 --> 00:27:14,51
Distorted it i mean i've seen i've
seen the whole sort of monkey business

409
00:27:14,51 --> 00:27:18,88
that goes on with the media different media
as you know some distorted where they

410
00:27:19,69 --> 00:27:21,02
totally were totally ignored it

411
00:27:21,02 --> 00:27:25,23
or they turned it into something totally i
did you know it would have to interpret

412
00:27:25,96 --> 00:27:31,62
it totally dark rather than give the
full story. You know what it really is.

413
00:27:32,84 --> 00:27:35,16
But then others said i was using it

414
00:27:35,16 --> 00:27:39,08
but every time they put it in there
it was a plus like media's a plus.

415
00:27:39,12 --> 00:27:43,63
Even if they give you bad ass
to me bad media is still media.

416
00:27:43,78 --> 00:27:48,09
I mean it actually raising people
are being raised about the issue.

417
00:27:48,13 --> 00:27:51,68
I mean even though they can call us what
they we like they like you know these

418
00:27:51,68 --> 00:27:53,99
and dirty unkempt paul.

419
00:27:54,67 --> 00:27:59,70
And dog bludging whatever it's still
the issue was about a forest.

420
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,89
The paring toxic waste
going into the system.

421
00:28:04,91 --> 00:28:06,11
You know these things

422
00:28:06,11 --> 00:28:09,91
and if they really people want to really
want to what are these people on about

423
00:28:09,91 --> 00:28:14,23
they'll know they come up and people
are come to the actions as people

424
00:28:14,23 --> 00:28:17,23
that come up they find out even
the journalists that turn up.

425
00:28:17,36 --> 00:28:21,31
They get they get a mouth. They get
an earful of what we're there.

426
00:28:21,57 --> 00:28:25,90
If they rejected that you know on the
cutting on the cutting board you know

427
00:28:25,90 --> 00:28:29,84
when in the cutting wherever it is
you know in the editing stages.

428
00:28:30,11 --> 00:28:34,03
It's you know on the policy wherever
there is they still got the information

429
00:28:34,03 --> 00:28:36,60
that made its way into
goes into the politician.

430
00:28:37,34 --> 00:28:40,13
So they all they let they
get it if they listen

431
00:28:40,13 --> 00:28:43,38
or not getting the information has
been a really good tool to me

432
00:28:43,38 --> 00:28:48,46
that direct action always. Is
still good because it does it.

433
00:28:48,51 --> 00:28:52,37
It is sort of you grab them when
they say oh well you know we just.

434
00:28:53,71 --> 00:28:57,12
I will listen to them but with you
know business as usual sort of thing.

435
00:28:57,16 --> 00:28:59,49
So they're just sort of
hold them to ransom.

436
00:28:59,52 --> 00:29:02,83
You know non-violent direct so the other
thing is doing non-violent direct action

437
00:29:03,78 --> 00:29:03,79
and

438
00:29:03,80 --> 00:29:09,55
that whole development of non-violent direct
action of doing things to make people

439
00:29:09,55 --> 00:29:11,07
aware.

440
00:29:11,08 --> 00:29:15,95
Without you know with without
going to war over it you know

441
00:29:15,95 --> 00:29:18,77
or so it was it was an exercise in

442
00:29:18,77 --> 00:29:22,58
that itself like the theatrical
of the direct action of theater.

443
00:29:22,84 --> 00:29:34,17
And the repeating yourself
in arrestable situations.

444
00:29:34,19 --> 00:29:38,81
The fear base. Well oh yeah.

445
00:29:39,01 --> 00:29:43,70
I observe i observe people's
expressions through the visor.

446
00:29:43,75 --> 00:29:46,52
I mean every time i get
up and i listen to people

447
00:29:47,45 --> 00:29:54,29
and the feedback is a lot of people within
the movement say it's great because it

448
00:29:54,29 --> 00:29:59,92
got me involved a lot of people sort of
helped a lot of people to be. In our.

449
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,26
Since also plays on the guilt of people
like you say you know they were consumed

450
00:30:05,26 --> 00:30:07,56
just go along just forget
about it you know and.

451
00:30:08,25 --> 00:30:10,75
You know sort of you know
suffering up the earth.

452
00:30:10,75 --> 00:30:14,46
You know your lifestyle is just let it
happen if you're not on the fence you know

453
00:30:14,46 --> 00:30:18,71
you're part of the you're part of the
problem if you do nothing to you.

454
00:30:18,79 --> 00:30:23,36
Just letting it happen. So it's
played on the guilt as well. And was.

455
00:30:25,45 --> 00:30:28,78
Well i sort of i develop those
slogans after it sort of developed

456
00:30:28,78 --> 00:30:32,05
that sort of other development
sort of greed those of us

457
00:30:32,05 --> 00:30:35,47
that sort of like you know you know
this is what we're looking at here.

458
00:30:35,62 --> 00:30:37,68
This is awful for money.

459
00:30:38,61 --> 00:30:41,59
I mean there's no other reason why they
want to knock down it's just for money for

460
00:30:41,59 --> 00:30:42,34
the retail

461
00:30:43,28 --> 00:30:47,81
and you know was work
consumed be silent guy

462
00:30:48,63 --> 00:30:51,24
that came off off of.

463
00:30:51,26 --> 00:30:56,76
A graffiti in adelaide and i picked up
so i added that on to on to the toga.

464
00:30:57,54 --> 00:31:02,47
And then i rely on yapper see
that sort of piece that in when

465
00:31:02,47 --> 00:31:07,59
when i was in queensland sort of all happened
in stages over time left period sort

466
00:31:07,60 --> 00:31:14,00
of over a couple of years from 90 80 to
90 90 to the sort of fully established

467
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:16,01
character.

468
00:31:16,03 --> 00:31:22,67
And then it's costing the earth
and that sort of grew out of.

469
00:31:22,69 --> 00:31:28,40
The franklin. Put that on. Before that and
i was actually before the friend i was.
