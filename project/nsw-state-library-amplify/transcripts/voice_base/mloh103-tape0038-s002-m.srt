1
00:00:14,13 --> 00:00:16,46
So really you ride a horse
to school every day.

2
00:00:17,30 --> 00:00:17,50
Yeah

3
00:00:17,50 --> 00:00:22,61
but only for a year old because then i
think i might have them before they wanted

4
00:00:22,61 --> 00:00:24,82
it back because their own
children were going to school

5
00:00:24,82 --> 00:00:28,24
and it was a long way to school.
How long have i do you think.

6
00:00:28,26 --> 00:00:33,05
Well i'm up to one because
it seemed a very long way

7
00:00:33,05 --> 00:00:38,42
but then i was i was young but i would
say that it had to be too much of them

8
00:00:38,42 --> 00:00:40,97
or more and down a steep hill

9
00:00:42,28 --> 00:00:45,98
and then two times a week we'd have to
go from coffee camp to bishop's creek to

10
00:00:45,98 --> 00:00:49,35
pick the my lap which would be another
two mile and then up a human game.

11
00:00:51,16 --> 00:00:55,45
So it was when we had no shoes and
never wore shoes i don't know

12
00:00:55,45 --> 00:00:56,80
but you know winter and summer.

13
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:03,05
Yes i can remember wearing shoes and when
they took the horse back. He walked.

14
00:01:03,12 --> 00:01:09,41
Oh yes some of the dork brother was to
be going. My sister and he went to you.

15
00:01:09,41 --> 00:01:12,89
So i think she would have left and you
know on the brother matthew bell and

16
00:01:12,89 --> 00:01:18,07
that was down and how what time in
the morning which is all right.

17
00:01:18,09 --> 00:01:22,52
And remember that it had to be fairly
early because it was a long way

18
00:01:23,55 --> 00:01:30,12
and what do you what time did i like
my 9:00 to 3:00. So i'm emotional.

19
00:01:30,13 --> 00:01:32,69
Find me. And.

20
00:01:34,13 --> 00:01:38,22
How many kids went to so
we're not going to remarry

21
00:01:38,22 --> 00:01:44,70
and probably it's been
20 something like that.

22
00:01:44,74 --> 00:01:49,40
I can't remember we were the only 10 you
know i had no problem at all because of

23
00:01:49,40 --> 00:01:52,48
the time i went to school i could
speak english you did your brothers

24
00:01:52,48 --> 00:01:55,21
and sisters having.

25
00:01:55,22 --> 00:01:57,76
To teach you to play them
a bit i think it was more

26
00:01:57,76 --> 00:01:59,68
that they were trying to speak
italian. But of course.

27
00:02:01,00 --> 00:02:04,23
Not knowing what they were saying
my brother got into a few scrapes

28
00:02:05,20 --> 00:02:07,67
and i can remember. Actually this was

29
00:02:07,67 --> 00:02:11,11
when i was going to school the
teachers school teachers.

30
00:02:12,74 --> 00:02:17,59
School teachers mr. doyle and he had a
little of you know we had kids believe it

31
00:02:17,59 --> 00:02:20,13
or kid he was and my brother was real.

32
00:02:21,51 --> 00:02:23,31
Nearly you know football and type

33
00:02:23,31 --> 00:02:29,52
and this little kid timing they most was
teasing him. So we picked him up and.

34
00:02:30,21 --> 00:02:33,24
Much as i downed in a fresh power pack.

35
00:02:33,26 --> 00:02:37,20
I had and when he turned him
around again it was a mess

36
00:02:37,20 --> 00:02:43,74
and he ran screaming back to his father
and lunchtime minimum back to home.

37
00:02:45,57 --> 00:02:50,25
And i think out shouldn't
do that to begin with.

38
00:02:50,33 --> 00:02:54,43
I disagree with their disciplinarian school
teacher now it was pretty good really

39
00:02:54,43 --> 00:03:00,71
easy was pretty good and.
When i think you put a lot.

40
00:03:00,76 --> 00:03:04,77
I think it's a realize that we
were italians and because of

41
00:03:04,77 --> 00:03:07,95
that he helped us sort of
thing you know and i put up.

42
00:03:07,97 --> 00:03:12,69
Yes we probably put up with what he may
not have done with another another child

43
00:03:12,69 --> 00:03:14,81
probably that's just my impression of it

44
00:03:14,81 --> 00:03:21,48
and what he did you really are just
my mind just gotten dresses you know

45
00:03:21,48 --> 00:03:25,54
you know the left and you know no
you know for nobody in uniform.

46
00:03:25,77 --> 00:03:30,63
You know and the kids in
news. They all had cotton.

47
00:03:30,85 --> 00:03:32,98
I mean they're all really poor people.

48
00:03:40,62 --> 00:03:43,90
Do you keep in touch with any of those
children that you went to school with

49
00:03:43,90 --> 00:03:46,07
when it is you know
them from time to time.

50
00:03:46,32 --> 00:03:49,28
Not anymore no longer referendum school.

51
00:03:52,95 --> 00:03:54,62
No i'm saying the wrong thing.

52
00:03:56,92 --> 00:03:59,95
I don't actually kept in touch
but strangely enough one.

53
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,14
No those boys

54
00:04:01,14 --> 00:04:07,40
that went to the school now live in
the street in robotham yeah yeah and

55
00:04:07,41 --> 00:04:11,46
but this is really used to go to
school but you know i haven't.

56
00:04:12,13 --> 00:04:16,28
I haven't actually kept in touch but
we made up. I have also so going now.

57
00:04:16,30 --> 00:04:21,33
Recently i joined the bonsai society
and through that i met another girl

58
00:04:21,33 --> 00:04:23,03
and went to scale them on a sweep.

59
00:04:23,99 --> 00:04:28,48
She was then so but actually having
kept contact with them you know

60
00:04:28,48 --> 00:04:31,93
and you know you know
you know well i left.

61
00:04:31,94 --> 00:04:37,08
Actually left there when i
was fairly young. To go.

62
00:04:37,11 --> 00:04:40,69
You guys school will
probably come to that later.

63
00:04:40,93 --> 00:04:44,85
We didn't go to the christmas trees i
remember going to the christmas tree there

64
00:04:44,85 --> 00:04:49,61
which was absolutely magic for me because
i had never seen things like my life

65
00:04:51,26 --> 00:04:53,91
and one time one year old
in the most beautiful

66
00:04:53,91 --> 00:04:57,93
when broidered handed
with unbelievable to me

67
00:04:58,74 --> 00:05:01,18
and another time i was
given a little doll which.

68
00:05:01,30 --> 00:05:04,81
The first of i'd ever had in my life
and i thought it was so beautiful.

69
00:05:05,21 --> 00:05:07,39
Until my brother met little.

70
00:05:07,73 --> 00:05:14,48
Tummy open to see what it was you know
and it was straw and i cried and cried.

71
00:05:14,78 --> 00:05:16,92
I didn't want my doll they
have stolen it coming

72
00:05:18,53 --> 00:05:22,36
and i don't know what happened with a
dolphin unc they'll probably pick step up

73
00:05:22,37 --> 00:05:27,94
tell me more about the christmas night
what did they do because well it sort of

74
00:05:27,94 --> 00:05:29,73
played games and things like that.

75
00:05:29,79 --> 00:05:36,24
You know and santa came which was to me was
just something you know nothing unique.

76
00:05:36,73 --> 00:05:41,16
And no one none of them and none of
them what experience you know in

77
00:05:41,16 --> 00:05:45,13
that anyone who did they have what
kind of christmas celebration.

78
00:05:45,17 --> 00:05:48,31
If they don't think they have very much.

79
00:05:48,52 --> 00:05:52,52
Although the reason name for santa claus

80
00:05:52,52 --> 00:05:54,41
but it's really the family
which means a life.

81
00:05:56,51 --> 00:05:59,74
But i mean when you're poor you don't
have christmas inside and things like.

82
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,08
Just try had you to have
special known extra street.

83
00:06:03,15 --> 00:06:04,76
You had sort of special days

84
00:06:04,76 --> 00:06:10,62
when they made what we call cross to
me which is a really a pride biscuit

85
00:06:10,62 --> 00:06:14,42
and that's a special occasion weddings.

86
00:06:14,52 --> 00:06:16,87
They still have them a friend

87
00:06:16,87 --> 00:06:19,61
and i have made prolonged
weddings made of course not

88
00:06:19,61 --> 00:06:24,70
that i'm any good only i'm good at cooking
on special of cooking you want to seem

89
00:06:24,70 --> 00:06:29,41
like crossley that i like to
take but i can't make them.

90
00:06:29,42 --> 00:06:32,94
Did your mother teach you
how well she probably did

91
00:06:32,94 --> 00:06:38,07
but we didn't have any machines to me
only out of the bottle. To do them then.

92
00:06:38,11 --> 00:06:40,18
So they would they were
more or less the same.

93
00:06:40,51 --> 00:06:42,29
Yes that was special occasion

94
00:06:42,29 --> 00:06:47,02
and another special occasion they made a
torta a which is nothing like the taut age

95
00:06:47,02 --> 00:06:52,00
they were made here but it would made
with blood that they caught from the pigs

96
00:06:52,00 --> 00:06:58,51
and in even a grimace.

97
00:07:00,05 --> 00:07:04,40
I have since time an aunty has since
made it here and i agree with you.

98
00:07:04,49 --> 00:07:05,45
I take

99
00:07:05,46 --> 00:07:11,71
that you know i put in the door as if
it was a widget to grab in my mouth.

100
00:07:11,72 --> 00:07:13,45
But it's quite nice.

101
00:07:13,88 --> 00:07:18,54
You mention you mentioned and i
notice that your home to your mother.

102
00:07:20,06 --> 00:07:25,51
Your husband he or i don't
know side of the family.

103
00:07:25,54 --> 00:07:29,66
Well i haven't got any aunties so it
would have to be my husband simon and me

104
00:07:29,66 --> 00:07:31,20
and i don't have any you know your father

105
00:07:31,20 --> 00:07:34,98
and mother had no other relatives
you know you know no time.

106
00:07:35,95 --> 00:07:39,93
Do you do you did your mother and
father keep in contact with.

107
00:07:39,95 --> 00:07:43,73
Oh yes yes yes mum wrote
to them right up to me

108
00:07:43,73 --> 00:07:46,76
and you know they did have
contact with are you.

109
00:07:48,28 --> 00:07:50,85
Not me personally but the family.

110
00:07:50,87 --> 00:07:56,45
Do you have a lot of relatives to
be cousins now yes i did see them

111
00:07:56,45 --> 00:07:58,16
when we went back in 78.

112
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,10
But i didn't really know
with them and i found that.

113
00:08:06,12 --> 00:08:08,35
I was more astray liam and what i thought.

114
00:08:08,62 --> 00:08:13,40
Did you feel terrible and yes i
completely a foreigner. Yes.

115
00:08:14,33 --> 00:08:15,89
Did i understand you find.

116
00:08:16,00 --> 00:08:21,00
Oh yes we still speak the same dialect
even here you would have a and

117
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:26,16
and trailing accent no i probably didn't
they never said anything they understood

118
00:08:26,16 --> 00:08:32,31
you know you are you know no
problems and no tell me about.

119
00:08:33,18 --> 00:08:36,29
Truth. You know. Oh well

120
00:08:36,29 --> 00:08:40,19
that that's going yes back to just
recently we had the chestnut night.

121
00:08:40,27 --> 00:08:42,39
Well it was a tradition in italy.

122
00:08:42,45 --> 00:08:45,70
That was one of the things
that they did have was

123
00:08:45,71 --> 00:08:51,23
when the chestnuts were ripe they would
cook them on coals you know over the

124
00:08:51,23 --> 00:08:55,96
burning coals and they'd have a
party drinking wine and chestnuts

125
00:08:57,61 --> 00:09:00,93
and it happened that it would
be about ten years ago now.

126
00:09:03,87 --> 00:09:07,52
We'd play bowls and our team and one
when with no one expected us to win.

127
00:09:07,60 --> 00:09:11,59
You know and i was so thrilled about it
that i think i why don't we celebrate

128
00:09:12,50 --> 00:09:15,46
and so we said we'll celebrate
up our place which is here

129
00:09:16,90 --> 00:09:19,65
and then it sort of went on
from there and some was there.

130
00:09:19,65 --> 00:09:22,73
Well why don't we make it a
chestnut night which we did.

131
00:09:24,00 --> 00:09:26,96
And we had all these people came.

132
00:09:27,31 --> 00:09:29,62
I think original ones would
have been the ones that

133
00:09:29,62 --> 00:09:31,34
when the committee with the indoor bowlers

134
00:09:33,06 --> 00:09:36,38
and it was strange to me i sort
of sat back and look at them

135
00:09:36,38 --> 00:09:38,80
and they're saying this
is great. This is great.

136
00:09:38,94 --> 00:09:42,54
It's just like it was to be and
it brings back all those memories

137
00:09:43,25 --> 00:09:45,95
and they were reading all these
chestnuts we got our very much.

138
00:09:45,99 --> 00:09:48,40
Anyway wasn't very impressed.
Where did you get the just such.

139
00:09:48,80 --> 00:09:51,69
That came from sydney
a friend of the three

140
00:09:51,69 --> 00:09:55,83
but having those actually have
your board meeting sent them up

141
00:09:55,83 --> 00:09:59,20
and what we do then would prove
them they preach quite well.

142
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,36
Then take me out of the night raised
them but we turned it into a barbecue

143
00:10:04,36 --> 00:10:08,41
and it was you know a good view but i
can still remember the first night.

144
00:10:09,57 --> 00:10:13,90
The older italian the hair
of filmy were you know.

145
00:10:14,38 --> 00:10:18,04
And did you have that when your child
if you happen to know you know

146
00:10:18,04 --> 00:10:21,48
that on the first one probably thinking
my god. Taking on me like really.

147
00:10:21,48 --> 00:10:25,65
You could a very expensive and
know you know in the book

148
00:10:25,65 --> 00:10:28,93
and tell me about the washing up kids.

149
00:10:30,20 --> 00:10:35,36
Oh yeah that was a work of art
and this is to be a kerosene tin

150
00:10:35,36 --> 00:10:37,31
and i can't remember
how you cut it exactly

151
00:10:38,51 --> 00:10:42,49
but i think it would cut
it on the top and bottom

152
00:10:43,87 --> 00:10:47,73
and then the side leaving only one
side and cut so that you could open it

153
00:10:47,73 --> 00:10:52,48
and it would give you two triangles around

154
00:10:52,49 --> 00:10:54,49
that they would put board so
you wouldn't cut yourself

155
00:10:56,02 --> 00:10:58,80
and one was used for washing
and one type of washing up

156
00:10:58,80 --> 00:11:02,14
and one type of anything which
made it through thick thin

157
00:11:02,92 --> 00:11:06,38
and we also had one of those for washing
ourselves you know not our bath

158
00:11:06,38 --> 00:11:11,28
but our hand. Yeah because we had
we didn't wash our hands inside

159
00:11:11,28 --> 00:11:16,30
and we had a little bench outside like
a laundry tub. It sort of yeah yeah.

160
00:11:16,38 --> 00:11:19,92
It made too little tub
and everyone had those.

161
00:11:19,93 --> 00:11:23,46
Because there are times when useful i
think the english community as well.

162
00:11:23,60 --> 00:11:25,76
I see you know now i mean to me

163
00:11:25,76 --> 00:11:28,95
but then i must admit i didn't
go into the hands of the english

164
00:11:28,95 --> 00:11:32,86
but i don't know where they
landed from because they have.

165
00:11:33,35 --> 00:11:37,33
They had it when we when i arrived but i
mean i can remember said what is right

166
00:11:37,33 --> 00:11:39,47
and you know i don't know
having a shortage of water

167
00:11:39,47 --> 00:11:41,99
or having to be careful with the water.

168
00:11:42,88 --> 00:11:47,24
Did you do the dishes once a day or you
know i think they were done every day

169
00:11:48,72 --> 00:11:48,73
and

170
00:11:48,74 --> 00:11:54,29
that was what you want to because you're
looking at a thousand gallon tank for a whole

171
00:11:54,29 --> 00:11:59,88
family so that it might save
lives. Any water washing about it.

172
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,89
We put on the venue. I can remember i
tell you about our little army after

173
00:12:05,89 --> 00:12:10,56
that what we did what i
would do like the vision

174
00:12:10,56 --> 00:12:16,11
that would first be rinsed out and any
sort of scraps that came up your clothes

175
00:12:16,11 --> 00:12:20,16
and that went towards the
feed from team. You know you.

176
00:12:20,18 --> 00:12:23,18
So everything with nothing was wasted.

177
00:12:23,99 --> 00:12:25,39
Nothing and that with

178
00:12:25,39 --> 00:12:28,45
that water situation the way it was
did you wash up after every meal

179
00:12:28,45 --> 00:12:32,01
or save the dishes to no
one i remember we used to.

180
00:12:32,09 --> 00:12:37,79
We used to wash up every day but the
thing is that if it really rain short

181
00:12:37,79 --> 00:12:42,69
or before it rain sure that actually you
would get your water for washing up

182
00:12:42,69 --> 00:12:45,31
and for washing engrams from a creek

183
00:12:45,31 --> 00:12:50,56
or from a well i think we might have had a
well up there. But a countryman recruit.

184
00:12:50,64 --> 00:12:54,56
So like you have you would have to
get water from somewhere because

185
00:12:54,56 --> 00:12:58,58
that wouldn't do you say you when you're
running low temp kept a program thing.

186
00:13:00,05 --> 00:13:01,97
Tell me about the the people.

187
00:13:03,03 --> 00:13:09,97
Oh yes our salaaming we assume
they could i think bought a little

188
00:13:09,97 --> 00:13:12,87
pig from a farmer small
pin and we feed it.

189
00:13:13,94 --> 00:13:19,08
So it wasn't what it would use that
and a normal item for myself to have.

190
00:13:19,12 --> 00:13:22,45
Oh it was really amazed with
a pig an expensive item.

191
00:13:22,49 --> 00:13:26,47
Well it wasn't a very expensive item because
it was boardroom in there it's more

192
00:13:26,47 --> 00:13:29,42
and you write yourself you
have a little peep in

193
00:13:30,79 --> 00:13:35,23
and any of the scraps from the pigeons in
before you go towards the pink feeding it

194
00:13:35,23 --> 00:13:37,05
then we grew our own corn.

195
00:13:38,05 --> 00:13:39,09
So that was fed to it

196
00:13:39,09 --> 00:13:45,61
and then the wife from after making a
record to change all the changes so

197
00:13:45,62 --> 00:13:47,83
that it was really inexpensive.

198
00:13:48,57 --> 00:13:53,55
To feed and it was very large
we kept it for about a year

199
00:13:53,55 --> 00:13:58,22
and it was very large at the end
of the year. So then kill it.

200
00:13:58,28 --> 00:14:01,83
And of course as children were. Made
to go away when they killed it.

201
00:14:01,89 --> 00:14:05,99
But are you to take one peek i think i
mean i didn't think it was very nice.

202
00:14:06,06 --> 00:14:09,16
Anyway so i never looked again but.

203
00:14:09,18 --> 00:14:13,96
Then it would be made into
sausages and salami the sausages

204
00:14:14,86 --> 00:14:15,37
and there was nothing

205
00:14:15,37 --> 00:14:22,06
that was called could begin to
which you made with the end of the

206
00:14:22,07 --> 00:14:28,00
meat that wasn't the best and
you put the stack surely means

207
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:31,53
that the skin of the rind
on the peat would be mad

208
00:14:33,48 --> 00:14:38,48
and we made the sausages in the court to
give me family salami the subdivisional

209
00:14:38,48 --> 00:14:43,06
reason was made with the meat

210
00:14:43,07 --> 00:14:44,79
that had a bit of blood
on it with something

211
00:14:45,58 --> 00:14:49,04
and they wouldn't go in a very short time
because they wouldn't keep very long.

212
00:14:49,15 --> 00:14:53,27
But the salami in the quality would
have to last you practically all year.

213
00:14:54,63 --> 00:14:56,74
And they had no
preservatives in it at all.

214
00:14:57,78 --> 00:15:01,21
So what they did was they
dug a hole under the house

215
00:15:02,76 --> 00:15:05,70
and they put boards around
it and turned into a cellar.

216
00:15:06,50 --> 00:15:12,27
I think out cellar had from when i
can remember it was under the house

217
00:15:12,27 --> 00:15:15,89
and the floor of the house
was the top of the cellar.

218
00:15:16,12 --> 00:15:18,14
But i was talking to my
sister the other day

219
00:15:18,14 --> 00:15:22,07
and she said a really really first one
which i don't remember was a big box

220
00:15:22,78 --> 00:15:26,78
and the farmer how i was in the
ground and a big box was put there

221
00:15:26,78 --> 00:15:29,82
and we kept the salami. But
i don't remember that.

222
00:15:30,89 --> 00:15:36,35
So we put it in me and it had to
be like the coolest you could any

223
00:15:36,35 --> 00:15:38,08
when it rained of course
water when he bought it

224
00:15:38,08 --> 00:15:43,64
but you have to take the salami out
take them up inside and then you bail

225
00:15:43,64 --> 00:15:46,92
or water out the sunnis in finished
raining it help and when it was dry.

226
00:15:46,92 --> 00:15:50,52
Nothing put them back in the game because
it was very important that they be kept.

227
00:15:51,87 --> 00:15:52,95
Because they were things

228
00:15:52,95 --> 00:15:57,00
that we had to have known you know i
mean you have the same for all here and

229
00:15:57,00 --> 00:16:00,32
that was enough to keep well yes. Yes.

230
00:16:00,77 --> 00:16:02,08
As we got better

231
00:16:02,83 --> 00:16:06,88
and a bit more wealthy we have two pings
which would actually last two years. Yeah.

232
00:16:07,12 --> 00:16:10,67
And of course again it is something
that you cook actually cook it.

233
00:16:10,87 --> 00:16:15,04
You don't eat it raw you cook at
wherever salami that actually raw meat

234
00:16:15,04 --> 00:16:19,89
that you're reading. And you
would. Yes it would dry out.

235
00:16:19,98 --> 00:16:23,49
I imagine dry you know even
dry out you know it didn't.

236
00:16:23,76 --> 00:16:25,69
Those fellows were nearly
better than the ones.

237
00:16:25,76 --> 00:16:31,95
Later on you know what it would it would
be it would get a mold over it and

238
00:16:31,96 --> 00:16:37,02
that would help keep it dry and i think
you had to keep that women away from it.

239
00:16:37,02 --> 00:16:38,16
Otherwise that would dry it out

240
00:16:39,07 --> 00:16:44,35
but no it didn't write to dry out
in those days at all and the.

241
00:16:44,37 --> 00:16:49,43
Tell me about the cooking. You know
what do you think happens now.

242
00:16:49,50 --> 00:16:51,83
Well if you have the sinews and

243
00:16:51,83 --> 00:16:57,25
that of your meat you know the meat of lower
legs which is you don't want to miss a

244
00:16:57,25 --> 00:17:00,44
mummy because that they're
not very nice to eat raw.

245
00:17:00,58 --> 00:17:04,92
So you put all that and then you get
the rind from the pin that means all

246
00:17:04,92 --> 00:17:10,25
that up by hand you know we have a mensa.
Actually i think mum took it from me.

247
00:17:10,27 --> 00:17:13,99
Police took a lot of things from
italy and they would mince that up

248
00:17:15,54 --> 00:17:19,48
and they would put foot into it to claim

249
00:17:21,19 --> 00:17:23,45
that land you believe
skinned i think there.

250
00:17:26,24 --> 00:17:32,82
And it was actually one lamb would give
you one skin because it's the appendix so

251
00:17:32,83 --> 00:17:36,65
that you wouldn't have to tie the bottom
but the bottom is it's already round

252
00:17:36,65 --> 00:17:39,50
and you put it in very tightly
a pack a tight as you could.

253
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:41,64
And a lot of them used to burst.

254
00:17:41,69 --> 00:17:43,79
Because you'll be packing
of really tight to keep it

255
00:17:44,50 --> 00:17:47,11
and then you're tied on top
put three strings around

256
00:17:47,11 --> 00:17:51,85
and tighten again put a lot of how you
know one knew somebody forgot to put holes

257
00:17:51,85 --> 00:17:55,57
in of my all burst like balloons and
i think that when your relatives

258
00:17:56,42 --> 00:17:59,45
and then you hang them up to dry you
hang my up in the kitchen actually.

259
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,94
And two all the water and
soap out of them all before.

260
00:18:04,26 --> 00:18:08,48
Yeah i don't do that that
these days and i haven't done

261
00:18:08,48 --> 00:18:11,83
that alarm out of no matter what.

262
00:18:12,63 --> 00:18:15,55
The pretty well i've lasted longer salami.

263
00:18:15,70 --> 00:18:21,37
Yeah yeah yeah yeah because that removes
skin so that while to one pickles and.

264
00:18:21,39 --> 00:18:26,26
You. That got him a year
would be a pretty big thing.

265
00:18:26,28 --> 00:18:31,56
Did you need to pick any special
things people who know.

266
00:18:31,66 --> 00:18:36,28
You know it was getting all natural things
which is why the salami was so nice.

267
00:18:37,16 --> 00:18:42,12
The salami today are not
near what we have been.

268
00:18:42,14 --> 00:18:44,17
Because now they've got
preservatives in them

269
00:18:45,62 --> 00:18:50,50
and they feed them all these unnatural
to you know interesting morning to.

270
00:18:53,78 --> 00:18:59,19
Mr.. Rennet the main.

271
00:18:59,21 --> 00:19:02,05
Source of income few
father was bananas with it

272
00:19:02,05 --> 00:19:05,65
when i guess it was in the nana's
and that we starting to be.

273
00:19:07,50 --> 00:19:09,05
Shortly after we came i think.

274
00:19:09,20 --> 00:19:12,76
And as i said before there wasn't
a road up to the plantation.

275
00:19:13,95 --> 00:19:17,58
So they'd have to be carted with a
stick or some spring cardboard chap

276
00:19:17,58 --> 00:19:21,04
that i remember is me
he would pick them up

277
00:19:21,04 --> 00:19:26,61
and take them to a top of a very steep
hill and send them down on the flying fox

278
00:19:26,61 --> 00:19:31,46
and the bee the carrion jack ran
from in them with the carrier

279
00:19:31,46 --> 00:19:36,04
and he'd write down on the coffee came
right. And he'd stop them down there.

280
00:19:36,12 --> 00:19:39,99
Put the money truck and take them into
the railway to be sent to sydney.

281
00:19:40,57 --> 00:19:46,74
Yes well i remember one time somebody dared
somebody to go down on the flying fox.

282
00:19:47,54 --> 00:19:51,36
I wasn't there to see it but i believe he
went down and when he got to the bottom.

283
00:19:51,59 --> 00:19:54,63
He was so why do you find it
really memorable you know.

284
00:19:54,96 --> 00:19:59,95
You know it was very long and very deep you
know occasionally sometimes occasions.

285
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,88
My thing. Stopped in time
something the kindly

286
00:20:02,88 --> 00:20:06,80
that we broke in the not a lot of it was
work on the system and something down

287
00:20:06,80 --> 00:20:12,75
and then something up. I think. But i
don't think that we can do a very steep.

288
00:20:12,93 --> 00:20:17,21
Do you remember. What price between
like in those days for the price.

289
00:20:17,30 --> 00:20:19,34
Well the prices for those days

290
00:20:19,34 --> 00:20:24,60
and for a long time after actually i think
in those days they might have been a bit

291
00:20:24,60 --> 00:20:29,00
better than they were later
when i got out of sort of 10

292
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:35,16
or 12 that were later they weren't

293
00:20:35,16 --> 00:20:39,64
that bad that sometimes you might
send 30 40 cases and bananas

294
00:20:39,64 --> 00:20:41,46
and they were bigger cases
and what we have now.

295
00:20:43,32 --> 00:20:47,00
And you get maybe you have
a dozen penny stand back.

296
00:20:47,29 --> 00:20:48,94
So you get nothing out of

297
00:20:48,94 --> 00:20:52,46
that you had your production costs which
in your case to start off with the carrier

298
00:20:52,46 --> 00:20:57,23
make to carry them over to the
top. Yes. So it was very hard.

299
00:20:57,54 --> 00:21:02,47
The only way we actually did lead was
because we were pretty self-sufficient in

300
00:21:03,68 --> 00:21:08,84
and at the time you know the workings
that you had to buy and from

301
00:21:08,85 --> 00:21:13,07
when inside could remember there
was a shopkeeper in town.

302
00:21:13,07 --> 00:21:17,70
J a meringue and jam iranian he had
a shop. You know in the street.

303
00:21:17,72 --> 00:21:17,93
I think

304
00:21:17,93 --> 00:21:22,49
that he was going over to the railway station
he had a shop there for a long time.

305
00:21:22,61 --> 00:21:23,99
He later moved to.

306
00:21:25,66 --> 00:21:27,95
Would love street with the
imperial bottle shop is now

307
00:21:29,66 --> 00:21:32,48
and he would give credit
to the italian food

308
00:21:33,84 --> 00:21:36,49
and he carried it would carry
the month after month you know

309
00:21:36,49 --> 00:21:40,11
and probably wouldn't even ask for money
because in you know didn't have any anyway.

310
00:21:40,41 --> 00:21:46,27
And i also knew that it's anybody
could they would pay them and that

311
00:21:46,28 --> 00:21:48,18
when they planned the
beans and things like

312
00:21:48,18 --> 00:21:50,85
that they would get some money in beans

313
00:21:50,85 --> 00:21:56,23
and vegetables were rather good proposition
in those days because there being no

314
00:21:57,22 --> 00:21:59,56
frozen food or no canned foods.

315
00:22:01,15 --> 00:22:05,01
They would be came to see me in them in the
winter months where they couldn't grow

316
00:22:05,01 --> 00:22:08,85
them down there so much and
they would be worth money.

317
00:22:09,02 --> 00:22:12,33
That's how it made me how
they survived i think.

318
00:22:12,35 --> 00:22:15,73
And in the very first time
when they planted the bananas.

319
00:22:16,46 --> 00:22:19,99
They were planned they actually planned to
being in between the bananas which would

320
00:22:19,99 --> 00:22:25,23
give them a very quick quick make use of
the land in the quick cash crop nothing of

321
00:22:25,23 --> 00:22:30,20
life that no no no you had to really
what are the vegetables. Did you go.

322
00:22:31,01 --> 00:22:32,45
I think we grew just about everything

323
00:22:32,45 --> 00:22:37,83
but taters to martin he being you know
hearty member a lot of vegetables.

324
00:22:38,26 --> 00:22:40,48
Did you know flavoring like her.

325
00:22:41,88 --> 00:22:46,84
Now the only prim i can remember was raising
me because you didn't need me anything

326
00:22:46,84 --> 00:22:53,10
and i think i would grown up with that
word and hear a lot of time in the amount.

327
00:22:53,96 --> 00:22:58,79
And. How old were you when
you moved from coffee cans.

328
00:23:00,45 --> 00:23:05,48
I was 10 i think we went and you got

329
00:23:06,91 --> 00:23:10,72
but i actually changed the school and
went to the gym by school before

330
00:23:10,73 --> 00:23:15,80
that because that ended banana did
you guys. And so after that up.

331
00:23:15,91 --> 00:23:16,76
We started my brother

332
00:23:16,76 --> 00:23:20,57
and i started going to dubai school which
was a long way away to learn about four

333
00:23:20,57 --> 00:23:25,80
miles and how did you
get all involved there

334
00:23:25,80 --> 00:23:29,39
and you know like later on the.

335
00:23:29,97 --> 00:23:34,88
Did you find your brother
and his brother your ship

336
00:23:35,86 --> 00:23:42,19
and they walked over to you dave and
well. Yes they would have had to.

337
00:23:43,08 --> 00:23:45,60
I always remember well know

338
00:23:45,60 --> 00:23:51,35
that they the house was built like you
know down the july which was a big

339
00:23:51,35 --> 00:23:55,83
improvement on the house we had up here at
the top of the problem by which we call

340
00:23:55,83 --> 00:23:59,95
gun alley. How much there would
have been a road by now. So it.

341
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:03,48
Probably would have gotten i think
they might have had a horse

342
00:24:04,90 --> 00:24:06,26
and they would have got a ride.

343
00:24:06,54 --> 00:24:11,38
Sometimes with a carrier up talking of the
carrion later on we did a ride to the

344
00:24:11,38 --> 00:24:16,00
farm and the carrier come and took
them bananas and he was the only way

345
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:19,86
that our family had of
getting to town the carrier

346
00:24:21,67 --> 00:24:24,42
and i remember one time
as always in my memory

347
00:24:24,42 --> 00:24:29,32
when my sister was pregnant
really well advanced too

348
00:24:30,23 --> 00:24:32,23
and she had to go probably
to the doctor i don't know

349
00:24:33,22 --> 00:24:37,94
and the only way to go with it
was with a carrier. So this guy.

350
00:24:38,13 --> 00:24:45,05
My mother went to my mother had been sick
for a long time so she was in sitting

351
00:24:45,05 --> 00:24:48,73
in the front and his mother went to
the center of my room to my sister

352
00:24:48,73 --> 00:24:51,15
and also she had to sit on
top of the load of bananas

353
00:24:52,27 --> 00:24:56,59
and i think it made a sort of little pocket
for a deceiving you know like the case

354
00:24:56,59 --> 00:24:57,12
out of something

355
00:24:57,12 --> 00:25:02,17
that she was sitting on top of maybe 200
cases of the none of them pregnant.

356
00:25:02,19 --> 00:25:05,35
But that was lucky she was probably one
of the lucky ones made up there you know

357
00:25:06,11 --> 00:25:07,62
but. And.

358
00:25:09,11 --> 00:25:12,81
Did your father built the house
to go yet they helped you on

359
00:25:12,81 --> 00:25:14,37
that i think they got
someone to help them.

360
00:25:14,65 --> 00:25:16,87
And they built it into the bigger house.

361
00:25:17,02 --> 00:25:23,78
How different was back to
the place well i think the

362
00:25:23,78 --> 00:25:25,55
board was still overlapped in the years

363
00:25:25,55 --> 00:25:30,72
and i might have been changed later
it was bigger it will bigger

364
00:25:31,87 --> 00:25:34,86
or so we had a dining room
there which was you know.

365
00:25:36,04 --> 00:25:37,48
Big thing in the dining room

366
00:25:38,93 --> 00:25:44,12
and it was close to the school
which made living much easier.

367
00:25:45,60 --> 00:25:49,66
And how many were well once again there
would have been there was the room

368
00:25:49,66 --> 00:25:53,98
and mum and dad and the girls and
the boys still slept on the veranda

369
00:25:53,98 --> 00:25:58,09
and yes the boys were still on the
green and kitchens in some areas.

370
00:25:58,29 --> 00:25:59,91
Yes we had a kitchen and a better.

371
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:02,91
Fire place in the bathroom
on the corner of the brain.

372
00:26:04,34 --> 00:26:07,57
But still had no water filled but
i mean them to a lot lot later

373
00:26:07,57 --> 00:26:09,26
and your mother did you cook over the ice.

374
00:26:09,73 --> 00:26:12,98
Did you know she'd never mean that
she never called the apple pie

375
00:26:12,98 --> 00:26:14,86
and she always had a stove.

376
00:26:15,34 --> 00:26:21,98
Yes he'll stay in your new home

377
00:26:21,98 --> 00:26:26,43
and she go with any other italian then you
know we still didn't have any italian

378
00:26:26,43 --> 00:26:32,30
maybe around. We were the only one mile
at that time later on some did can

379
00:26:32,30 --> 00:26:38,47
but never anyone close close to was not
within walking distance must have been hard

380
00:26:38,47 --> 00:26:43,74
at the child growing up having who did you
play with like surely life would be very

381
00:26:43,74 --> 00:26:46,53
lonely. I remember life of being lonely.

382
00:26:47,72 --> 00:26:53,92
Because we had i had no other children
to play with how many between you

383
00:26:53,92 --> 00:26:59,16
and there was too between my
brother and i but i was the one

384
00:26:59,16 --> 00:27:01,94
that was always getting into trouble and
he was a little chant mine you know.

385
00:27:02,37 --> 00:27:08,64
I think i think he is that sees me and
then i told him so then he began tell mum

386
00:27:08,64 --> 00:27:12,89
and i was always in trouble. I was law in
trouble. What kind of punishment people.

387
00:27:13,24 --> 00:27:17,98
I she didn't even know she actually give
any other except for you. Yelling at me.

388
00:27:18,01 --> 00:27:22,35
I think or certainly a lot
of that. Were very much.

389
00:27:23,68 --> 00:27:27,52
Kids were seen and not heard
you know good very much

390
00:27:27,52 --> 00:27:32,71
that they had in them to actually my father
and their little into my life. At all.

391
00:27:34,29 --> 00:27:35,11
But i distinctly remember

392
00:27:37,14 --> 00:27:41,15
when we were still up in the old place
that's where my other sister my elder sister

393
00:27:41,15 --> 00:27:42,19
got married from

394
00:27:43,63 --> 00:27:49,20
and my brother had made friends with these
power members they had two daughters who

395
00:27:49,20 --> 00:27:50,79
were deaf and dumb retrying ruby

396
00:27:50,79 --> 00:27:54,70
and one of them get the most beautiful
quite a shrink very fine stuff

397
00:27:54,70 --> 00:27:59,91
that i never seen but i haven't seen
anybody even if i haven't seen since and.

398
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,62
Down some whether they had asked to do
what i magine they asked to do what might

399
00:28:03,62 --> 00:28:07,04
pay them. She done all this question from
my sister who was going to get married

400
00:28:08,27 --> 00:28:09,39
and that when it

401
00:28:09,39 --> 00:28:13,57
when the got home i put it all out
on the bed it covered the whole bed

402
00:28:13,57 --> 00:28:17,92
and up onto the pillows and
it was absolutely beautiful

403
00:28:17,92 --> 00:28:24,33
and my sister had all this and i have
nothing. So i really put on a tantrum.

404
00:28:24,34 --> 00:28:29,47
I mean ask do you see an i can remember
telling us i'm glad you're going to get

405
00:28:29,47 --> 00:28:34,46
married then why we won't have to fix you
take me my whole life you cutting your

406
00:28:34,46 --> 00:28:38,56
good fortune. Anyway i think they gave
me want to keep me quiet in the end

407
00:28:38,56 --> 00:28:43,06
but i can still remember how i normally
go. And she had all these years.

408
00:28:43,41 --> 00:28:48,19
It was unbelievable to see it and
never having seen anything like

409
00:28:48,19 --> 00:28:54,14
that how i can be really you know i was
nearly eight me because she she got married.

410
00:28:54,42 --> 00:28:59,68
And you no doubt of receiving
you. She would have been 20.

411
00:29:01,21 --> 00:29:03,09
But i mean i can still see it.

412
00:29:03,09 --> 00:29:06,91
I can really still see it you know
all this treasure and i had nothing

413
00:29:07,62 --> 00:29:11,77
and what was what was she having done to
her to well apparently she'd been to the

414
00:29:11,77 --> 00:29:15,05
dentist before c and i think
she needed more feelings

415
00:29:15,05 --> 00:29:19,04
but she decided she wasn't going to happen
because she was getting married soon so

416
00:29:19,05 --> 00:29:22,15
i said when we do met
spend the money on her.

417
00:29:22,17 --> 00:29:28,66
But the other tellings in the community
the ones that you did come across.

418
00:29:29,09 --> 00:29:31,77
Did you understand each other.
Were they speaking the same time.

419
00:29:32,00 --> 00:29:34,13
And yes the mourners at that time more

420
00:29:34,13 --> 00:29:38,16
or less came from the same
place from northern italy

421
00:29:39,52 --> 00:29:40,67
that could have been sicilians

422
00:29:40,67 --> 00:29:43,29
that i didn't come in contact
with them so i really don't know

423
00:29:44,75 --> 00:29:50,39
but probably this assyrian would have
spoken italian in a few italian which my

424
00:29:50,39 --> 00:29:53,16
parents would have understood.
I didn't at the time i do now

425
00:29:54,21 --> 00:29:57,87
but at the time i wouldn't say
your parents taught you a dialect.

426
00:29:58,99 --> 00:30:02,72
Well i didn't actually take. And
all if we were just $5 at home.

427
00:30:02,80 --> 00:30:08,12
It wasn't actually taught me what how i
picked it had enough i wouldn't have a clue

428
00:30:08,12 --> 00:30:15,08
really because i can not very
complicated the conversation

429
00:30:15,09 --> 00:30:21,49
i mean if i go to a lawyer most started
speaking very you know there will be words

430
00:30:21,49 --> 00:30:24,07
i probably wouldn't know what they
were but i can make myself understood

431
00:30:24,07 --> 00:30:29,15
and if they speak plain tallien i can
understand that a digital system

432
00:30:29,15 --> 00:30:32,84
and telling people. Yeah she
married an italian from.

433
00:30:33,33 --> 00:30:35,84
Actually he was here before we came

434
00:30:35,84 --> 00:30:42,62
but he was from my hometown in italy to
very much around the home town i mean the

435
00:30:42,62 --> 00:30:44,19
families knew each other and all that

436
00:30:44,19 --> 00:30:47,32
and he had no family no no
he didn't have anybody.

437
00:30:47,58 --> 00:30:50,89
He was just him he came
out like over here. Yeah.

438
00:30:50,94 --> 00:30:56,27
To me it's only time but his family
later and brother did come his brother

439
00:30:56,27 --> 00:30:59,18
but that's all you know
most of the family came.

440
00:31:04,58 --> 00:31:06,22
I think i forgot to tell you carry

441
00:31:06,22 --> 00:31:11,20
and that's the school a coffee camp where
i went to no longer bear it is further

442
00:31:11,20 --> 00:31:13,50
down the road now got
washed away in the flood.

443
00:31:14,47 --> 00:31:17,34
I don't know what flood it
is really what year it was

444
00:31:19,27 --> 00:31:21,04
but they they rebuilt a new one

445
00:31:21,04 --> 00:31:27,63
and all the school records were lost
to some people did have a few photos

446
00:31:27,63 --> 00:31:33,21
and i did have it back to copy camp not
long ago that i didn't have some reason

447
00:31:33,21 --> 00:31:38,86
or other but they did have one of the
photos with all our family three of us

448
00:31:38,86 --> 00:31:41,61
or four of us were going to the
school yes but they had it

449
00:31:42,57 --> 00:31:46,88
when you leave the coffee campaign would
it take you to travel from copycatting to

450
00:31:46,88 --> 00:31:50,04
listen you know we never actually

451
00:31:50,04 --> 00:31:52,75
when the cop came because there
wasn't the road to coffee came.

452
00:31:52,96 --> 00:31:59,27
What would happen was from apogee go off
with a carrier to take in the good there.
