1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,57
When i was asking about about when he went
down to get the job and what he said.

2
00:00:04,69 --> 00:00:10,82
After he given you that it would have got
the job first reckoned you would have

3
00:00:10,82 --> 00:00:14,53
local threatened him so i mean
what. Oh well then. No i cause

4
00:00:14,53 --> 00:00:20,66
a problem straight or had it when me and
i hadn't been down there anyway. But

5
00:00:20,66 --> 00:00:22,19
apparently he had been threatened quite

6
00:00:22,19 --> 00:00:26,16
a bit by these first because jobs are
so hard to get and if anyone did get

7
00:00:26,16 --> 00:00:28,52
a job or if he knocked them back. I even

8
00:00:28,52 --> 00:00:32,95
a pretty tough old fellow. Yeah you know
you're here we're very curtly you know and

9
00:00:32,95 --> 00:00:36,98
yes just stand at the gate they are trying
to get in and as you went by i suppose i

10
00:00:36,98 --> 00:00:39,45
had abused him for not going
to a job but he couldn't give

11
00:00:39,45 --> 00:00:42,66
a job. To everyone but i was lucky
when i walked out. I happen to know

12
00:00:42,66 --> 00:00:45,87
a fellow outside how do you go.
Don i said i wouldn't have

13
00:00:45,87 --> 00:00:50,35
a clue. I said well it's and he said at
least you've got an interview i said that's

14
00:00:50,35 --> 00:00:53,63
about all i got anyway
that same afternoon i get

15
00:00:53,63 --> 00:00:59,43
a telegram to start the next morning. So i
did so but i didn't tell anyone you know

16
00:00:59,43 --> 00:01:03,64
i didn't tell this from them when they got
the job. At the time because jobs were

17
00:01:03,64 --> 00:01:08,39
really hard to get really james beer
was the engineer for substructure for

18
00:01:08,39 --> 00:01:12,03
a doorman long wasn't he. You know. Yes i
don't know his full title but i know he

19
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:18,78
was on the job all the time and very
he lived here up but lankov away

20
00:01:18,78 --> 00:01:23,88
somewhere greenish i think greenwich. You
know he was scottish was. I could tell

21
00:01:23,88 --> 00:01:28,67
you what he was but he's a very
tough looking character i tell you

22
00:01:28,67 --> 00:01:34,15
a very well in oh there's risk. He had
responsibility and i see from the records.

23
00:01:34,17 --> 00:01:39,17
He had responsibility for the quarry
doubt it. Maria as well as the all the

24
00:01:39,17 --> 00:01:44,27
foundations including the pylons that was
his job on the bridge but i believe that

25
00:01:44,27 --> 00:01:50,64
went before the the bridge joined that him
and the superintendent for steel work

26
00:01:51,69 --> 00:01:58,49
it well very well they they did one
side each so that mirror did both

27
00:01:58,49 --> 00:02:03,63
the substructure and. The superstructure
supervision on the one side and on the

28
00:02:03,63 --> 00:02:09,12
south side and that it well did them on
the other side all both the substructure

29
00:02:09,12 --> 00:02:12,81
and the superstructure so that they didn't
have to go back and forth although i

30
00:02:12,81 --> 00:02:16,23
will they couldn't anyway couldn't because
the bridge for the road was on their to

31
00:02:16,23 --> 00:02:21,57
cross over you know that because i had their
own boat. Oh yes well that'd be great

32
00:02:21,57 --> 00:02:26,45
. That's what they did so that after years
then when they joined then they resumed

33
00:02:26,45 --> 00:02:32,22
their various responsibilities which was
one year for substructure and and well for

34
00:02:32,22 --> 00:02:37,50
steelwork yes yes but as i say you
weren't there till after the i know your

35
00:02:37,50 --> 00:02:43,05
a well know i was there to laugh to rejoin
in fact after the road was just about

36
00:02:43,05 --> 00:02:48,79
getting laid by then and do you remember
when the bridge was joined around. Well

37
00:02:48,79 --> 00:02:53,15
yes yes i saw it i took photographs of
it which i got here of it. Joined i went

38
00:02:53,15 --> 00:02:55,93
down and i'm answer point and
took my own photograph of it and

39
00:02:56,84 --> 00:02:59,74
a little flag flying the top
of the bridge denoted soon as

40
00:02:59,74 --> 00:03:03,04
a joint they put that flag
up and i got a photograph of

41
00:03:03,04 --> 00:03:07,28
a taken from mcmahons point with my little
old brownie camera which i carried with

42
00:03:07,28 --> 00:03:07,60
me on

43
00:03:07,60 --> 00:03:12,17
a bridge into some level fantastic photographs
taken. Yes i see this photograph is

44
00:03:12,17 --> 00:03:15,79
a very good. Do you did you know that
frank cash. Reverend frank cash was

45
00:03:15,79 --> 00:03:17,18
a photographer. He was

46
00:03:17,18 --> 00:03:22,93
a very good photographer. It was his hobby
and he was given the right to go and

47
00:03:22,93 --> 00:03:28,10
over at any part of that bridge and take
photographs and he climbed over that

48
00:03:28,10 --> 00:03:31,88
bridge time and time again you're
seeing with this camera in

49
00:03:31,89 --> 00:03:36,08
a bag over his shoulder and everyone respect
him. It was well known carried to down

50
00:03:36,08 --> 00:03:42,95
there great fellow frank ash
and. In fact his young son john

51
00:03:42,95 --> 00:03:46,03
cash came and played football with
my club for a little while when he's

52
00:03:46,03 --> 00:03:50,47
a youngster and he went and joined the
air force and unfortunate was killed

53
00:03:50,47 --> 00:03:56,10
overseas in that war. Yes. Did you know
anything else about cash at all. Frank you

54
00:03:56,10 --> 00:04:00,72
know no nothing more about him. I only
got to know him through senior mine i'm

55
00:04:00,72 --> 00:04:06,03
asked how he was i said i think that's frank
cassidy reverend frank cash from down

56
00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:10,31
here and walks free. No signature sound
there. Did you remember his voice did he

57
00:04:10,31 --> 00:04:10,48
have

58
00:04:10,48 --> 00:04:16,37
a peculiar voice well i only heard him speak
you know. Ordinarily and heard him at

59
00:04:16,37 --> 00:04:22,06
the service that they usually related about
the service. Just before that. Yeah.

60
00:04:22,96 --> 00:04:23,77
Some people have said he had

61
00:04:23,77 --> 00:04:29,05
a squeaky voice. Well i would write. Well
i knew avoid well you don't know when

62
00:04:29,05 --> 00:04:33,78
they're in the churches. I suppose and they
speak you just take that much notice to

63
00:04:33,78 --> 00:04:37,03
know that he could have had
you got to realize he's

64
00:04:37,04 --> 00:04:42,60
a remarkable man in here but here he was
metallurgist alleges an engineer in

65
00:04:42,60 --> 00:04:44,73
a western australian
goldfields before he became

66
00:04:44,73 --> 00:04:49,64
a clergyman. He was but he got silicosis
and that and he was out of that business

67
00:04:49,64 --> 00:04:52,58
and that's how he became a
clue to how we went became

68
00:04:52,58 --> 00:04:56,98
a clergyman after the whole i did not know
that he was an engineer is all i did not

69
00:04:56,98 --> 00:05:01,45
all that's wrong is to me
see he's his photographs

70
00:05:01,45 --> 00:05:06,80
a superb collection of us right from the
western australian girl feels right over

71
00:05:06,80 --> 00:05:10,27
here through the building of the bridge and
so many other things you have no idea.

72
00:05:10,40 --> 00:05:13,85
Well and you know he's an amateur photographer.
You know he was thousands are glass

73
00:05:13,85 --> 00:05:18,57
negatives. John breckinridge
was his helper. When he was

74
00:05:18,57 --> 00:05:23,89
a lad and he had them all the way that's
all there. Yeah. I don't know whether

75
00:05:23,89 --> 00:05:29,80
they've been donated yet but i
believe they will be if they. No.

76
00:05:31,85 --> 00:05:36,03
No little bit about the bridge. I mean as
i talk about the last stone being laid on

77
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:38,77
the bridge right now in fact i've got

78
00:05:38,77 --> 00:05:42,92
a photograph of that which i didn't take
i was up on top. I had to look as i was

79
00:05:42,92 --> 00:05:47,37
working but on the last stone block of
ground that they went in the bridge which is

80
00:05:47,37 --> 00:05:51,100
on the north western side
of the bridge. They had

81
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,81
a north north. No no. And i'm north
western side or bridge with this i n and

82
00:05:57,81 --> 00:06:04,12
e there and i was on top of the pile
at the time we will working together

83
00:06:04,98 --> 00:06:09,98
and i asked what was going on and
apparently as the stone was laid down we

84
00:06:09,98 --> 00:06:16,67
understood that each of those
at roos. Redfield live.

85
00:06:16,71 --> 00:06:21,64
Let's field you and all of those chappies
off to get know all their names lawrence

86
00:06:21,64 --> 00:06:26,99
and. I and assess right and all of those
they cut two shillings in two or had them

87
00:06:26,99 --> 00:06:32,84
cut in two and half of that two shilling
piece was put under that last stone that

88
00:06:32,84 --> 00:06:37,20
when it on the bridge and they kept the
other half hours i meant oh maybe to hang

89
00:06:37,20 --> 00:06:38,98
on a watch chain which what such

90
00:06:38,98 --> 00:06:45,22
a woman who stays. But when i spoke
to dr bradfield son year or so ago at

91
00:06:45,22 --> 00:06:46,97
a ceremony a bit of

92
00:06:46,97 --> 00:06:51,98
a get together we old timers he did not
know that so i told my bit of history about

93
00:06:51,98 --> 00:06:56,59
his own father or that titian in peace on
that last. So if you're to go and lift

94
00:06:56,59 --> 00:07:01,29
a block of ground up. Now you know you
know probably fine if you have to shell in

95
00:07:01,29 --> 00:07:07,36
pieces. I don't think anybody's going to
go there you are right. And so i only wish

96
00:07:07,36 --> 00:07:11,93
i could do the same all the bits that i
got the souvenirs right along so i mean i

97
00:07:11,93 --> 00:07:12,14
got

98
00:07:12,14 --> 00:07:20,24
a big bit of granite as just chipped
off down the bottom of the foundation

99
00:07:20,25 --> 00:07:24,75
of the pylon great big bit which when people
sometimes come from overseas. I might

100
00:07:24,75 --> 00:07:25,87
ship them off of it and say there's

101
00:07:25,87 --> 00:07:30,99
a general bit of sydney harbour bridge the
other thing on. Got here today is which

102
00:07:30,99 --> 00:07:32,71
i use extensively is

103
00:07:32,71 --> 00:07:39,16
a wire brush that was used to brush down
all the cement after the rendering and all

104
00:07:39,16 --> 00:07:42,87
the get together when the cleaning went
down on the bridge with all the acid and

105
00:07:42,87 --> 00:07:46,50
water mixture and all that and
we chipped it all i've got

106
00:07:46,50 --> 00:07:50,82
a brush. When we won't do anything else.
And we're done later and we're put on this

107
00:07:50,82 --> 00:07:57,44
brush to help. Rush down the
the pylon. And the granite and

108
00:07:57,44 --> 00:08:01,40
i've still got the one of the
original brushes which i use quite

109
00:08:01,40 --> 00:08:03,30
a lot myself here today when i'm doing

110
00:08:03,30 --> 00:08:09,40
a bit of painting of the original bridge.
Tell me what was your actual work what

111
00:08:09,40 --> 00:08:11,77
did you do when you were working as

112
00:08:11,77 --> 00:08:18,71
a rigger well the job was we done the and
the other wrecked in the bridge at all.

113
00:08:20,87 --> 00:08:21,29
Gantries

114
00:08:21,30 --> 00:08:27,52
a little bits of scaffolds and go and after
job was done and you use cables you'd

115
00:08:27,52 --> 00:08:33,27
have to put those cables down them roll
them up all the odd jobs about the place to

116
00:08:33,27 --> 00:08:38,27
the odd jobs. Had you ever done done that
sort of work before with it. Ropes and

117
00:08:38,27 --> 00:08:44,33
such like. No no i didn't even belong to
the boy scouts even. Even know whether ty

118
00:08:44,33 --> 00:08:45,44
or not but you learnt

119
00:08:45,44 --> 00:08:51,97
a bit there. You know how to do two round
turns and two 1/2 inches which. You know

120
00:08:51,97 --> 00:08:55,42
which is quite good and i'm not so sure i
would have liked to have been on any of

121
00:08:55,42 --> 00:08:59,29
your scaffolding i know. And i know i was
the other boys i know and you do you two

122
00:08:59,29 --> 00:09:04,56
who always had to have two round turns
first to stop any step in and the two half

123
00:09:04,56 --> 00:09:09,23
each just was the actual end of it and
then you know if you had a little bit of

124
00:09:09,23 --> 00:09:14,25
a cable left over. You had when
you call women women and that was

125
00:09:14,25 --> 00:09:21,03
a bundle of string type stuff and you
had to tie that to stop that from

126
00:09:21,03 --> 00:09:27,93
moving at all so that would be absolutely
the. It had to be 100 percent. You

127
00:09:27,93 --> 00:09:32,68
know. Not that was that was good enough.
It was not good enough and it was

128
00:09:32,68 --> 00:09:36,82
inspected you know. So you had to make
sure you done everything. Well did jim

129
00:09:36,82 --> 00:09:41,29
campbell show you in the first place. Oh
yes i met jimmy jarrett what to do but

130
00:09:41,29 --> 00:09:46,26
course he had his off side us and
one thing and he was the general

131
00:09:48,68 --> 00:09:52,31
man about the house sort of. Did you
come across to tom evans he was

132
00:09:52,31 --> 00:09:56,66
a regular on the no i don't remember the
names years ago. You know you name time

133
00:09:56,66 --> 00:10:02,80
and you know bill. Tom dick and harry as i
say but you never got to know many but i

134
00:10:02,80 --> 00:10:07,30
fear the younger ones and i vented at the
time we used to go after work and go to

135
00:10:07,30 --> 00:10:09,38
old water houses pub which is

136
00:10:09,38 --> 00:10:16,30
a well-known name in the betting and
raising game the day old. Charlie

137
00:10:16,31 --> 00:10:21,75
waterhouse that had the pub opposite. Well
i could tell some not some funny stories

138
00:10:21,75 --> 00:10:26,49
but you know i'd be held up for defamation
i suppose of us to tell you those but as

139
00:10:26,49 --> 00:10:32,72
you'd go in to his old pub an old
board floor not even linoleum have

140
00:10:32,72 --> 00:10:37,17
a beer or two and in his backyard you have
chocks of the chooks would come into the

141
00:10:37,17 --> 00:10:40,97
bar and there'd be besson on the
floor and the two boys they had

142
00:10:40,97 --> 00:10:46,52
a pet goat or two or sheep
sheep if i can now i think was

143
00:10:46,52 --> 00:10:52,68
a goat and i'd take them underneath where
the bradfield park is now to put on my

144
00:10:52,68 --> 00:10:54,92
grass over there and this is

145
00:10:54,92 --> 00:11:01,34
a true about old friend. Charlie what
houses pub. And i go down there and i time

146
00:11:01,34 --> 00:11:02,60
for drinks made

147
00:11:02,60 --> 00:11:07,67
a couple of young scots blokes and we are
all same age. We got on well together. Go

148
00:11:07,67 --> 00:11:08,20

149
00:11:08,20 --> 00:11:12,79
a drink with them and time and so he's
upstairs in bed. You know there i said what

152
00:11:23,42 --> 00:11:28,01
a bearing go home on my own but you know

153
00:11:28,68 --> 00:11:34,01
Where we're liftin up by block and
tackle one of the big cables to put on

154
00:11:34,01 --> 00:11:39,75

which the guide rope that hit one of our

155
00:11:39,75 --> 00:11:45,17

across toward charlie water houses pub

156
00:11:45,17 --> 00:11:50,63
to get brandy for him he wasn't really
badly hurt by any means but is knocked out

157
00:11:50,63 --> 00:11:51,80
a bit and shook shaken

158
00:11:51,80 --> 00:11:57,45
a bit. So when they got over there. How
they come back ration with this glass

159
00:11:57,45 --> 00:12:02,70
bottle of i think we're going to glass
or i forget now which but i was standing

160
00:12:02,70 --> 00:12:07,00
there and this fellow waved aside i know
i'm all right so the fella looked at the

161
00:12:07,00 --> 00:12:13,52
first around i love how the other then saw
all. Safety glass back to water houses

162
00:12:13,52 --> 00:12:20,40
bob. He said well that's not going to go
to waste. The brand himself. You know you

163
00:12:20,40 --> 00:12:20,70
could make

164
00:12:20,70 --> 00:12:27,52
a story and see the funny things that happen.
Those days. I could go on reminiscent

165
00:12:27,52 --> 00:12:31,82
of our time to just sit down and if i had
ever written down all the things that

166
00:12:31,82 --> 00:12:35,44
i've seen on there and other
things and i i could write

167
00:12:35,44 --> 00:12:42,13
a book you know. And it was felix for the
one that was killed was there when you

168
00:12:42,13 --> 00:12:47,32
were there and one rescued all but i was
there i forget his name one survived you

169
00:12:47,32 --> 00:12:54,15
know he was lucky he survived and
kelly i think is no more wreck. Yeah

170
00:12:54,15 --> 00:13:01,07
one survived but likely but because
we never had the safety we do

171
00:13:01,07 --> 00:13:07,22
those what to do today. You know the
safety things are all going to be where we

172
00:13:07,22 --> 00:13:10,86
were there wasn't even any lahar the hell
helmet days those days there are no hard

173
00:13:10,86 --> 00:13:15,51
helmets. Tell me you said in the beginning
that you were worried when you first

174
00:13:15,51 --> 00:13:16,19
went up there

175
00:13:16,19 --> 00:13:21,84
a bit later. Or do you started volunteering
for dangerous. Yes yes. What do you

176
00:13:21,84 --> 00:13:27,27
mean by that. What did you volunteer for
that was dangerous. Well the job which go

177
00:13:27,27 --> 00:13:29,39
when out on those temporary girders

178
00:13:29,39 --> 00:13:36,21
a report up to put out the scaffold
that was hang down and do all the

179
00:13:36,21 --> 00:13:39,91
pile and clean as wasn't for the pylon
cleaners and they took pointed i don't think

180
00:13:39,91 --> 00:13:44,79
quarter took point in those days but the
finishing persons of the to do the face

181
00:13:44,79 --> 00:13:51,67
work. Of the pylon you know and various
other little jobs you know which

182
00:13:51,67 --> 00:13:51,87
for

183
00:13:51,87 --> 00:13:57,53
a little bit risky which others didn't
want to do i sold out you know and which i

184
00:13:57,53 --> 00:13:58,49
gladly done i thought

185
00:13:58,49 --> 00:14:02,38
a better experience of course you were gay
more silly those days i don't know which

186
00:14:02,38 --> 00:14:07,48
were both. Ready for when i was

187
00:14:07,48 --> 00:14:09,24
a different story. Oh yes

188
00:14:09,24 --> 00:14:15,61
a different story as one fella said to me
will do what we do. John john i said was

189
00:14:15,61 --> 00:14:20,14
that one for the boss and one for yourself.
So when i was helping i remember first

190
00:14:20,14 --> 00:14:25,72
job living down a bit of a scuffle in
down underneath the roadway we had to put

191
00:14:25,72 --> 00:14:30,08
a temporary scaffold up there for the
cleaning purposes not from the top of the

192
00:14:30,08 --> 00:14:31,37
pylon but just underneath

193
00:14:31,37 --> 00:14:35,84
a roadway and i was let in down the rope
there and i said i grabbed hold of some i

194
00:14:35,84 --> 00:14:40,81
forget now which was some part of the
structure and i made sure i had my left hand

195
00:14:40,81 --> 00:14:44,76
round and round part of the structure on
the other one and down at the left and i

196
00:14:44,76 --> 00:14:49,00
thought gradually you work into this. It's
like everything else you do you know you

197
00:14:49,00 --> 00:14:49,17
take

198
00:14:49,17 --> 00:14:56,91
a city for the first time and but as
you get more. You know you take you

199
00:14:56,91 --> 00:15:00,35
don't you don't need risks that that's
like everything it take. No risk at the

200
00:15:00,35 --> 00:15:04,04
beginning but in the end you when you
know you can do these things you do them

201
00:15:04,04 --> 00:15:09,52
automatically but just still do it with
care and safety. You got any more. Stories

202
00:15:09,52 --> 00:15:15,85
you can tell about the actual
working. What bridgework yes. Of

203
00:15:15,85 --> 00:15:22,24
not really not really the only centred
around my. You know. Oh i was threatened

204
00:15:22,24 --> 00:15:27,45
once myself and old scots tom. I suppose
i thought i thought i have been

205
00:15:27,45 --> 00:15:31,39
a bit funny i suppose you know you know how
are you when you're young and you hear

206
00:15:31,39 --> 00:15:35,10
people with the different voice
scots voice or an english voice or

207
00:15:35,10 --> 00:15:38,44
a foreign voice. You're
sort of just ended in

208
00:15:38,44 --> 00:15:45,10
a friendly sort of way but
he objected to. You're he

209
00:15:45,10 --> 00:15:49,85
objected. Oh yes he thought i was hammersley
i wasn't really i sort of just you

210
00:15:49,85 --> 00:15:54,29
know to be friends with everyone you
know you take everyone off and he was

211
00:15:54,29 --> 00:15:57,57
a big great big giant of a fellow
with a beard. I remember he had

212
00:15:57,57 --> 00:16:01,40
a beard and he said i won't have any all
that he said are you go with the so why do

213
00:16:02,76 --> 00:16:09,55
. You know so i can mimic him and well him
i suppose i mean making everyone which

214
00:16:09,55 --> 00:16:15,03
do these things out of fun more or less
and but he thought i was having a bit of

215
00:16:15,03 --> 00:16:19,31
a shot. I wasn't really you know i was
trying to be friendly. I suppose but he

216
00:16:19,31 --> 00:16:20,65
objected sort of having

217
00:16:20,65 --> 00:16:26,76
a shot at him. And can you remember any
of the other people who worked on the

218
00:16:26,76 --> 00:16:32,87
bridge that you could tell stories about
the only one that i can tell stories you

219
00:16:32,87 --> 00:16:33,94
know as i say they've got

220
00:16:33,94 --> 00:16:38,58
a lot of fellas in experience all
that i work and one person who i got

221
00:16:38,58 --> 00:16:39,91
a job. Some of his mates got

222
00:16:39,91 --> 00:16:45,52
a job on there when i clean it down. We
had to climb up ladders from one scaffold

223
00:16:45,52 --> 00:16:50,37
to the other when we are going home overnight
or knocking off. For lunch. Whatever

224
00:16:50,37 --> 00:16:52,71
it was just saying i might have to

225
00:16:52,71 --> 00:16:57,19
a tree scaffold up and they were connected
with forty foot ladders and you had to

226
00:16:57,19 --> 00:17:01,51
climb down these letters onto the next one
and down to the next one like. But that

227
00:17:01,51 --> 00:17:05,62
fellow from the time he went on the job
you don't like clean inside of things he

228
00:17:05,62 --> 00:17:09,91
never looked round him once because his
friends told me if you looked around once

229
00:17:09,91 --> 00:17:14,52
you deformed and there were and it scared
as though they had to one fell there in

230
00:17:14,52 --> 00:17:19,17
front of me as i went down the ladder one
fella guiding him down another fella

231
00:17:19,17 --> 00:17:25,58
holding him his back to assure him that
everything was safe and the story was that

232
00:17:25,58 --> 00:17:30,12
this prolific his name. Jim or something.
Never looked round once when his climb

233
00:17:30,12 --> 00:17:34,57
a climb up level out as he was scared all
the time scale all the time but i don't

234
00:17:34,57 --> 00:17:41,50
know i mean that was just nature i
suppose. Yeah but yeah see i suppose.

235
00:17:41,51 --> 00:17:46,04
Well those days when you know people think
nothing of it you know but others. Well

236
00:17:46,04 --> 00:17:49,46
necessity necessity for getting up

237
00:17:49,46 --> 00:17:55,89
a. Well there's one area
of that we haven't covered

238
00:17:56,63 --> 00:18:02,10
very much at all. And that's your sporting
career. You keen on sport all your life

239
00:18:02,10 --> 00:18:05,48
i've been i've never been married you will
always know i've been married someone

240
00:18:05,48 --> 00:18:07,44
ask me why i never got
married i said i never had

241
00:18:07,44 --> 00:18:11,95
a spare saturday afternoon because it's
too busy unsporting if it wasn't plain

242
00:18:11,95 --> 00:18:13,64
rugby in winter. It was sailing

243
00:18:13,64 --> 00:18:20,17
a summer or down surfing or with my surf
club or anything so actually i never had.

244
00:18:20,19 --> 00:18:20,68
Never had

245
00:18:20,68 --> 00:18:27,64
a spare set out but anyway that's my
story and so good. That you had to look

246
00:18:27,64 --> 00:18:33,97
after your mother. Yes when she got on i
have seen much of your father started. You

247
00:18:33,97 --> 00:18:38,58
started school or were forced to leave and
i thought no i don't know i left early

248
00:18:38,58 --> 00:18:43,19
those days because those days i had no sport
it's girl much nothing at all. Nothing

249
00:18:43,19 --> 00:18:48,21
really no organized when i look at it
today and see what's given to the young

250
00:18:48,21 --> 00:18:53,13
fellas today. I know i thought well and
i wish we had it those i know we had

251
00:18:53,13 --> 00:18:58,65
nothing. No really sports master we weren't
encouraged to do anything and maybe add

252
00:18:58,65 --> 00:19:02,57
if i'd gone to high school which i didn't
because i couldn't afford to do those

253
00:19:02,57 --> 00:19:07,63
things. Maybe they did at those schools
but i was in force. Enough to go to high

254
00:19:07,63 --> 00:19:11,70
school i had to leave as i said
before i even turned fourteen to get

255
00:19:11,70 --> 00:19:18,36
a quid. But. I first i had two years
playing soccer is planned soccer

256
00:19:18,36 --> 00:19:22,11
a friend of mine's a friend
play soccer got me had

257
00:19:22,11 --> 00:19:27,55
a couple of the soccer but i didn't go on
with it and i knew others i played rugby

258
00:19:27,55 --> 00:19:29,19
i said well come up and i am

259
00:19:29,19 --> 00:19:34,86
a rugby. So i joined up northern suburbs
rugby football club in 1927 and i'm still

260
00:19:34,86 --> 00:19:38,67
with i'm in nineteen eighty eight. So it's

261
00:19:38,67 --> 00:19:44,60
a long long time i played.
Oh played. I suppose it's

262
00:19:44,60 --> 00:19:47,01
a record number of games i've played

263
00:19:47,01 --> 00:19:53,57
a were well over 600 games are
rugby with my club. Six hundred

264
00:19:53,57 --> 00:19:59,30
over 600 games we never recorded them but
of well over 600 i plagiarize fifty three

265
00:19:59,30 --> 00:20:01,38
years of age and they reckon i was getting

266
00:20:01,38 --> 00:20:03,69
a bit old which i jacked it to
i thought i could it or not

267
00:20:03,69 --> 00:20:05,94
a few people here. I carry my togs for

268
00:20:05,94 --> 00:20:09,69
a couple of years after that my
cousin going with a fourth grade as

269
00:20:09,69 --> 00:20:14,75
a hooker and the course in the summer
time i sold on the famous old eighteen

270
00:20:14,75 --> 00:20:20,29
footers when they were really eighteen
foot as they were timber boats. And with

271
00:20:20,30 --> 00:20:27,18
eighteen foot eight foot beam eight foot
been about twenty inches of deck in space

272
00:20:27,18 --> 00:20:33,72
to put your spares so that i left
approximately just sixteen sixteen foot of

273
00:20:35,65 --> 00:20:37,27
space and sometimes we carried

274
00:20:37,27 --> 00:20:44,03
a crew of ten eleven even twelve on when
we had the big sail on. And other times

275
00:20:44,03 --> 00:20:48,94
you might only take about six or
seven. But you carried a crew in

276
00:20:48,94 --> 00:20:52,79
a sail to what the weather was or going
to be or what your thoughts sometimes of

277
00:20:52,79 --> 00:20:57,10
course if you get over to our garden island
i don't go and i'm sorry. Clark island

278
00:20:57,10 --> 00:21:01,48
where the boat started from the skipper
thought he had to me on board any cause of

279
00:21:01,48 --> 00:21:04,38
the. The wind lightened off

280
00:21:04,38 --> 00:21:10,02
a bit. So he said rather you you and you
dive overboard but i was lucky i i was

281
00:21:10,02 --> 00:21:10,54
lucky i was

282
00:21:10,54 --> 00:21:16,98
a sheet hand and i because i had my job
to do one of few two or three of the boys

283
00:21:16,98 --> 00:21:20,60
that have to do over how and we pick them
up on the way back after the race but

284
00:21:21,33 --> 00:21:25,10
they were funny days and they were tough
old days those days and you had to work

285
00:21:25,10 --> 00:21:30,01
hard. There was no fun about it at all.
You were never it's fun but hard. But you

286
00:21:30,01 --> 00:21:34,17
can always remember the boats. Sometimes
you would not give away sometimes you know

287
00:21:34,17 --> 00:21:38,50
you know race and you've got to give way
to the other boater on window view. Well i

288
00:21:38,50 --> 00:21:42,16
ask you i wouldn't give away one day so
the other boat come alongside us they

289
00:21:42,16 --> 00:21:43,12
jumped around boat

290
00:21:43,12 --> 00:21:47,66
a couple of their crew started fighting
with our boat our bloke fought them back

291
00:21:47,66 --> 00:21:48,27
and there was

292
00:21:48,27 --> 00:21:52,44
a fight going on between the two crews delay
their skipper yelled out get back onto

293
00:21:52,44 --> 00:21:56,74
the bloody boat he said we're sailing not
fighting and these i'm telling the truth

294
00:21:56,74 --> 00:22:00,94
. These are things i went on those old days.
Remember one day we were going down to

295
00:22:01,96 --> 00:22:08,16
towards bradley's head and everyone
on the shore where house and just

296
00:22:08,16 --> 00:22:12,01
a follow the races those days and i
called out my old skipper which is

297
00:22:12,01 --> 00:22:18,75
a great little scout that final me and bob.
Look we are going he said i know where

298
00:22:18,76 --> 00:22:23,63
i'm going and he instead of keeping his
eye on on his forehead and it was looking

299
00:22:23,63 --> 00:22:27,63
to see the shallows on the rocks is giving
us an idea. So it's giving him the sign

300
00:22:27,63 --> 00:22:31,45
to go about to get away from the rocks of
east where in and he's replying to these

301
00:22:31,45 --> 00:22:35,64
fellas on the shore. You know how many shot
at him. I know where i'm glad all going

302
00:22:35,64 --> 00:22:38,77
he didn't he went up on the
rocks and we tipped like

303
00:22:38,77 --> 00:22:42,71
a bent nuffin. Then the
fin which she had a put

304
00:22:42,71 --> 00:22:45,42
a big they still finnan
about there's days. Not

305
00:22:45,42 --> 00:22:50,64
a keel leak on the fin those days and we
had to get pushed off someone come and.

306
00:22:50,66 --> 00:22:53,58
Good enough or we jumped out and pushed him
off the rocks but we couldn't continue

307
00:22:53,58 --> 00:22:58,63
because our fin was bell. So we let drop
down the sail went home by the jib and it

308
00:22:58,63 --> 00:23:02,10
took him hours an hour so not down
the centre box what they called

309
00:23:02,10 --> 00:23:05,100
a box in the boat but you know i remember
that in the winter i know where i'm glad

310
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,49
it all going well it went up on the rocks
and then the fed. Oh little things like

311
00:23:11,49 --> 00:23:13,48
that and that was a drop you wasn't it

312
00:23:13,48 --> 00:23:17,83
a girl to have found just dropped australians
there shop to straight in and pull it

313
00:23:17,83 --> 00:23:23,32
out again and well when you went oh no.
When you know when about not about when

314
00:23:23,32 --> 00:23:28,57
you've got the wind behind you down when
you lose to lift it up and put two pins

315
00:23:28,57 --> 00:23:35,48
through to take the weight from and use
lifted up in the box which is in the boat.

316
00:23:35,50 --> 00:23:40,90
And lifted up and put two pins in to the
depths length of what you want of what

317
00:23:40,90 --> 00:23:44,91
skip would say that's near enough
and you put two pins through it

318
00:23:44,91 --> 00:23:47,19
a toehold and keep it up to

319
00:23:47,19 --> 00:23:51,11
a certain height to see but course when
you know blow and there to court you went

320
00:23:51,11 --> 00:23:54,60
a full length of the fin. Do you have

321
00:23:54,60 --> 00:23:58,58
a tack block and tackle to drop it down
and looked it up though. No no you had to

322
00:23:58,58 --> 00:24:04,62
hand to two of the crew would pick it up
two handles lift it up lifted up and while

323
00:24:04,62 --> 00:24:08,37
there lift and up to other support the
pin you see was that steel was it. Oh

324
00:24:08,37 --> 00:24:10,77
quarter in one of our friends when we had

325
00:24:10,77 --> 00:24:14,63
a big sale on quarter inch steel. It took
two blokes to carry it down to the boat

326
00:24:14,63 --> 00:24:19,37
and put it in. Oh my word and as luck would
have it. I had an old eighteen foot and

327
00:24:19,37 --> 00:24:19,71
when i was

328
00:24:19,71 --> 00:24:26,06
a kid in england i bought this this thing
it was called anyhow. And it was built in

329
00:24:26,06 --> 00:24:32,36
100 to go and buy five brothers who sold
it themselves. And it was made it too. You

330
00:24:32,36 --> 00:24:36,66
can credibly amount of money to cost them

331
00:24:36,66 --> 00:24:42,89
a solid ticket mahogany it wasn't
that it had a. Ok keel. But it had

332
00:24:42,89 --> 00:24:48,41
a block and tackle to get it down and up
that heavy was cast iron here. Oh well

333
00:24:48,41 --> 00:24:55,30
just to our crew just to come down at an
angle like that and i can tackle that

334
00:24:55,31 --> 00:24:59,21
with i think we had three fins one for
the small so one for the medium sail and

335
00:24:59,21 --> 00:25:03,71
this great big one when we had the big sail
on and there and norma speak sales norm

336
00:25:03,71 --> 00:25:09,52
just because they're different. I call them
toys these days. We go faster than you

337
00:25:09,52 --> 00:25:15,40
know well. Well much faster because they
are made of. I think laminator would be

338
00:25:15,40 --> 00:25:20,26
safer or something or other very
fine timbers and of course they have

339
00:25:20,26 --> 00:25:26,38
a three man crew and they have the.
You know all this light sails of.

340
00:25:26,40 --> 00:25:32,14
Very light sails very light spars house
bars those days were solid solid timbers

341
00:25:32,14 --> 00:25:38,100
solid. And sort of mast
solid xt. You know when we

342
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,93
put out the old balloon and all that this
happened the other you know it don't

343
00:25:43,93 --> 00:25:50,39
relent of the spinning spin they go up.
And i waitressed it. They had made of two

344
00:25:50,39 --> 00:25:55,30
or three pieces and they had a feral and
put them together. Push it out and have

345
00:25:55,30 --> 00:25:56,03
a bit of a rope

346
00:25:56,03 --> 00:26:01,06
a snot as they called it round the mast
and hooked it in that and it took some

347
00:26:01,06 --> 00:26:05,26
doing when you had to push out that spinning
there is no fun about it so it took

348
00:26:05,26 --> 00:26:10,57
some work. Now all solid spars but of
course with the sales as those bean counter

349
00:26:10,57 --> 00:26:15,34
sales they had to be but now with the
light things they got the elemental saw

350
00:26:15,34 --> 00:26:20,12
whatever they have them. Everything's light
on and those days it was more or less

351
00:26:20,12 --> 00:26:25,51
an art sailing then was something
and we have this me like of

352
00:26:25,51 --> 00:26:30,16
a saturday afternoon which i so never
bob on the sunny sailing. There were

353
00:26:30,16 --> 00:26:35,17
sometimes three and four ferryboat sister
by the thousands of people you know and

354
00:26:35,17 --> 00:26:38,27
the old bookmakers just get on
board on the other go and have

355
00:26:38,27 --> 00:26:45,06
a great little time on board and. The
ferryboat should be. When hilo had you know

356
00:26:45,06 --> 00:26:50,44
the decks were awash with water. You know
fought the good. Ferryboat so they should

357
00:26:50,44 --> 00:26:54,06
take all that they were on the top deck and
on the lower deck watching fall and the

358
00:26:54,06 --> 00:26:58,22
races around the house the people
fought on those days and it was

359
00:26:58,22 --> 00:27:03,67
a greater go in an internal you know it
take about so many legs down the harbor go

360
00:27:03,67 --> 00:27:10,40
about and oh it was really exciting really
exciting but it was hard work but you

361
00:27:10,40 --> 00:27:15,82
enjoyed it. You enjoyed it and if you got
to be more stories about different times

362
00:27:17,75 --> 00:27:24,53
