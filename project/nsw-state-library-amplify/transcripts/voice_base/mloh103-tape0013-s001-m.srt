1
00:00:08,83 --> 00:00:11,43
Cut in somewhere there after i.

2
00:00:13,11 --> 00:00:15,67
You got to go in and do this
in the trends weekly egg.

3
00:00:17,43 --> 00:00:30,42
I mean if i can be right.

4
00:00:30,44 --> 00:00:33,49
The relationship between freedom.

5
00:00:33,50 --> 00:00:40,00
And community is of course so

6
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:44,84
intense that most likely it needs to
talk about other factors as well.

7
00:00:46,62 --> 00:00:54,51
In order to get more of a circular
view instead of polarization.

8
00:00:54,53 --> 00:01:01,11
You can look at the niman experience
as being one where people came with an

9
00:01:01,11 --> 00:01:06,92
ideal of being very community or sharing
everything and have gone full circle

10
00:01:07,62 --> 00:01:10,11
and become fairly.

11
00:01:10,13 --> 00:01:11,28
Suburban

12
00:01:11,28 --> 00:01:14,33
and separate families

13
00:01:17,93 --> 00:01:23,12
but also within the first three
months. Of tangible fours.

14
00:01:23,73 --> 00:01:30,21
Those separate houses being started.
After much discussion and much talk.

15
00:01:30,61 --> 00:01:33,00
There was simply the need on dave getters

16
00:01:33,00 --> 00:01:39,87
and mandy give us a start to have
a separate space because they had

17
00:01:39,87 --> 00:01:46,83
children the force of children
drove them to start work on the

18
00:01:46,83 --> 00:01:52,22
first independent new
house. A ton of will force.

19
00:01:53,03 --> 00:01:59,79
And just to not be so. In trouble.

20
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,49
I'm not just for themselves

21
00:02:01,49 --> 00:02:08,32
but for other people because children
really really want to huge amount of their.

22
00:02:09,01 --> 00:02:13,84
Space their privacy and their
ownership of their parents that

23
00:02:13,84 --> 00:02:15,42
when those parents come through the door.

24
00:02:16,32 --> 00:02:18,71
They're there with those children

25
00:02:19,92 --> 00:02:23,44
and very quickly it became.

26
00:02:24,57 --> 00:02:28,92
Well as soon as that started within days.

27
00:02:28,94 --> 00:02:33,45
I came to the conclusion of bringing
in the word homeless and of

28
00:02:33,45 --> 00:02:37,51
and saying look there's going this is
going to happen all over the place.

29
00:02:37,56 --> 00:02:41,84
But let's try to have those houses
being built in clusters of houses.

30
00:02:43,55 --> 00:02:50,44
Let's call them hamlets and let's
try to get those to work together.

31
00:02:51,11 --> 00:02:55,38
In a particular area and to share
some of their land together

32
00:02:55,38 --> 00:03:01,80
and maybe their fruit crops or certainly
their access and whatever things

33
00:03:01,80 --> 00:03:02,68
that they want to share together.

34
00:03:03,14 --> 00:03:08,82
Let's just encourage people to share.

35
00:03:09,68 --> 00:03:12,70
I suppose their block.

36
00:03:13,65 --> 00:03:17,99
If you are thinking in terms of the city
you'd most likely be looking at all the

37
00:03:17,99 --> 00:03:19,60
backyards in one particular block

38
00:03:20,74 --> 00:03:23,79
or you might be looking at the in
some streets of the front yards

39
00:03:23,79 --> 00:03:29,12
and in a street because the street is
in fact more part of the place than the

40
00:03:29,12 --> 00:03:32,57
backyards and anyway.

41
00:03:32,59 --> 00:03:37,68
That started and we we
had these hamlets going.

42
00:03:39,29 --> 00:03:42,20
Right away. There was
that level of privacy.

43
00:03:42,59 --> 00:03:47,42
You know right away at the beginning
there was always a privacy in people's

44
00:03:47,42 --> 00:03:51,72
economics. There was no. Sharing of.

45
00:03:51,74 --> 00:03:57,70
Of money in a wider sense. And.

46
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,67
It's just as likely that in the future
neiman will become more commune

47
00:04:05,67 --> 00:04:10,21
or in terms of the work that
people are doing together.

48
00:04:11,89 --> 00:04:13,85
Because when people are
building their own houses

49
00:04:15,34 --> 00:04:18,28
and they're sharing a bit
of labor with each other

50
00:04:18,28 --> 00:04:22,26
but they're basically they're building
their own houses in that phase

51
00:04:22,26 --> 00:04:28,50
that they're very isolated and
that's commune or in many ways.

52
00:04:28,51 --> 00:04:31,96
So i think that over over time. Nim and.

53
00:04:32,18 --> 00:04:36,83
Might become more sharing.

54
00:04:36,85 --> 00:04:39,16
And hopefully with

55
00:04:39,16 --> 00:04:45,04
that it might in fact be more willing
to worry about its common problems.

56
00:04:45,12 --> 00:04:51,05
Its community problems and to share
responsibility for those community problems

57
00:04:51,05 --> 00:04:52,17
and to actually step in

58
00:04:52,17 --> 00:05:02,84
and take action about those.

59
00:05:04,78 --> 00:05:11,15
I suppose for me as a writer in
nimbin there's a lot of individuals.

60
00:05:12,82 --> 00:05:16,05
It's a lot of people who
don't fit into easy molds

61
00:05:16,05 --> 00:05:22,49
and there's a lot of people who while.

62
00:05:22,50 --> 00:05:28,53
Often falling into very
normal suburban patterns.

63
00:05:29,32 --> 00:05:33,58
Also break a huge number
of those patterns.

64
00:05:33,60 --> 00:05:34,06
So

65
00:05:34,06 --> 00:05:41,84
that there's a bit more stirring
of my imagination into what

66
00:05:41,85 --> 00:05:45,76
is possible and there's an
easier sharing of ideas

67
00:05:46,83 --> 00:05:53,37
and i think some people like it here at
the bush the elder there's not many towns

68
00:05:54,12 --> 00:05:59,72
where there is a theatre which is
just showing movies where the guests.

69
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,73
Actually come and talk to each other
for some half an hour beforehand

70
00:06:03,73 --> 00:06:05,03
and at interval

71
00:06:05,78 --> 00:06:10,50
and the interval is specially designed to
be ultra long extended interval in the

72
00:06:10,50 --> 00:06:13,91
middle of a movie so that everyone
talks to whoever is there

73
00:06:13,91 --> 00:06:17,47
that their friends of other
people they just meeting and

74
00:06:17,47 --> 00:06:22,35
that the whole movie experience
is in fact as much a talking.

75
00:06:22,62 --> 00:06:27,27
Commune all meeting place
experience as anything else.

76
00:06:28,50 --> 00:06:32,92
It's almost like a church experience.

77
00:06:34,31 --> 00:06:39,62
So that's really beautiful
and the bush the ed and the.

78
00:06:39,64 --> 00:06:45,45
Just running here is something that's
really special for me. Also i love this.

79
00:06:45,69 --> 00:06:48,59
But i love the factory as a building.

80
00:06:48,67 --> 00:06:54,74
I think it's quite grand it's
got beautiful architectural.

81
00:06:54,75 --> 00:06:59,76
Features and shape.

82
00:07:00,77 --> 00:07:03,67
The whole valleys a very beautiful valley.

83
00:07:03,68 --> 00:07:08,17
I've got a very close relationship
with the local curry population

84
00:07:09,99 --> 00:07:12,58
and i work with them.

85
00:07:14,14 --> 00:07:19,92
And i think that the whole valley
still has a huge potential which it.

86
00:07:20,08 --> 00:07:26,32
It's just wanders on disregarding and.

87
00:07:27,67 --> 00:07:34,44
Perhaps there in the future that potential
might actually be able to be utilized

88
00:07:34,44 --> 00:07:41,22
and really unleashed an in-between
time i think i suppose it gives me the

89
00:07:41,23 --> 00:07:42,69
chance to think about what.

90
00:07:43,37 --> 00:07:49,84
Individual communities across the
world could be doing themselves at a

91
00:07:49,84 --> 00:07:56,36
local neighborhood community level you
know i mean in the in the small thousands

92
00:07:58,01 --> 00:08:02,39
maybe four to 16000. And in that field.

93
00:08:02,70 --> 00:08:07,62
How much what can a can and community
of that size really do for itself

94
00:08:07,62 --> 00:08:11,78
and how good a quality of life. Can it
have and what are the economics of that.

95
00:08:11,89 --> 00:08:15,11
What is the reality of
that and what structures

96
00:08:15,11 --> 00:08:20,59
and ideas have to actually
be consciously working for

97
00:08:20,59 --> 00:08:24,99
that happen.

98
00:08:25,82 --> 00:08:30,33
Yeah yeah that's.

99
00:08:30,34 --> 00:08:34,53
Well i could just mention that part
of that sort of thinking of the.

100
00:08:34,88 --> 00:08:41,50
Four to 16000 people is part
of what i've called a geo

101
00:08:41,50 --> 00:08:42,54
village concept.

102
00:08:44,04 --> 00:08:50,90
And it's related to ideas that i have
a conceptual framework that i have.

103
00:08:51,55 --> 00:08:58,53
Which i go into an explore the question
of how many people do you need

104
00:08:59,24 --> 00:09:04,29
working in what sort of ways
to have a post mechanical.

105
00:09:05,06 --> 00:09:10,54
Community's economics
giving that quality of life

106
00:09:10,54 --> 00:09:14,32
that. Includes the world.

107
00:09:15,03 --> 00:09:17,35
That keeps people in contact with

108
00:09:17,35 --> 00:09:20,90
and understanding the
latest ideas in the world

109
00:09:21,72 --> 00:09:27,57
and able to actually put some of them into
place to actually utilize them into work

110
00:09:27,57 --> 00:09:30,52
them through what's what
is the relationship.

111
00:09:30,86 --> 00:09:33,96
We've we we've got some strong ideas now.

112
00:09:34,20 --> 00:09:39,46
What a nomadic community
social economics pattern is

113
00:09:40,17 --> 00:09:46,80
and we've got lots of examples
of agrarian such patterns

114
00:09:47,56 --> 00:09:51,26
and we've got lots of
examples of mechanical wage.

115
00:09:51,28 --> 00:09:52,53
Patterns but what

116
00:09:52,53 --> 00:09:58,71
that post mechanical pattern
is no one quite knows.

117
00:10:00,89 --> 00:10:02,75
Where.

118
00:10:04,25 --> 00:10:15,00
For you.

119
00:10:17,24 --> 00:10:23,65
Jumping from one idea to another
from one project to another the the

120
00:10:23,66 --> 00:10:30,53
linking the linking things for
myself is is understanding reality

121
00:10:30,53 --> 00:10:34,92
is is a clarifying is a is an exploring of

122
00:10:35,80 --> 00:10:38,24
and testing out of

123
00:10:38,24 --> 00:10:44,09
and then trying to be very specific
about what reality is how it works

124
00:10:44,09 --> 00:10:50,01
and how it can work better. And.

125
00:10:50,03 --> 00:10:55,66
All of these different stories musical

126
00:10:56,68 --> 00:10:59,50
theater. Land.

127
00:11:00,00 --> 00:11:05,46
And all of these different things
sort of just fit in with a pattern

128
00:11:05,46 --> 00:11:10,53
that i explore in my brain trying
to cope with this mad reality

129
00:11:10,53 --> 00:11:12,92
that we're stuck in and trying to simplify

130
00:11:12,92 --> 00:11:16,33
and clarify it more than simplify i think.

131
00:11:17,75 --> 00:11:21,72
The complexities ok as long
as we clear it and clarify

132
00:11:21,72 --> 00:11:25,69
and make it easier to understand
it doesn't need to be simple.

133
00:11:26,85 --> 00:11:29,10
We don't need to simplify
things to the extreme.

134
00:11:29,42 --> 00:11:34,94
We can cope with a pretty complex world
as long as we're clear about the

135
00:11:34,94 --> 00:11:37,75
complexities.

136
00:11:38,72 --> 00:11:46,93
Ok.

137
00:11:46,95 --> 00:11:48,51
Monday.

138
00:11:51,44 --> 00:11:56,20
As you know. I'm daisy stewart.

139
00:11:57,07 --> 00:11:59,88
I mean the bar in town. Dear.

140
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:06,38
The aquarius festival in 1973 place.

141
00:12:08,41 --> 00:12:09,46
Before or after

142
00:12:09,46 --> 00:12:15,62
or before very quiet nice peaceful town.

143
00:12:16,37 --> 00:12:18,52
Before the festival.

144
00:12:19,56 --> 00:12:24,56
Just say before before the
festival towers very quiet.

145
00:12:25,44 --> 00:12:32,35
Peaceful and lovely place
to live. How was it.

146
00:12:32,37 --> 00:12:38,78
Going down hill. I believe.
My business wasn't really.

147
00:12:39,67 --> 00:12:46,25
Paying well at that time. And the extra
people that came certainly boosted it.

148
00:12:47,98 --> 00:12:58,44
So what are your first reasons.

149
00:12:58,46 --> 00:13:01,08
The first time.

150
00:13:01,10 --> 00:13:05,98
I heard of it were three or
four guys and graeme dust

151
00:13:05,98 --> 00:13:08,73
and wheels one of them arrived into town.

152
00:13:08,76 --> 00:13:14,67
Enter the shop one day and started
to say what they proposed to do

153
00:13:14,67 --> 00:13:20,39
that was the first i'd heard of
it. I sort of thought oh yeah.

154
00:13:20,40 --> 00:13:23,47
This sounds alright.

155
00:13:24,67 --> 00:13:27,49
You know i sort of didn't really
know what they were getting at.

156
00:13:27,62 --> 00:13:34,10
At that time. So.

157
00:13:37,98 --> 00:13:42,17
I think the biggest majority
were for having this festival.

158
00:13:42,18 --> 00:13:43,71
There were two or three that weren't

159
00:13:45,58 --> 00:13:48,64
but they didn't voice their
opinions if they were against it.

160
00:13:49,85 --> 00:13:53,47
If you did but not not a reliable.

161
00:13:53,49 --> 00:13:59,17
Much.

162
00:14:00,27 --> 00:14:05,83
Not a real lot now i don't. I was
there briefly but i didn't stay.

163
00:14:05,85 --> 00:14:08,87
To the whole of the meeting.

164
00:14:08,88 --> 00:14:12,60
But i think the biggest percentage of
the business people in the town were.

165
00:14:12,62 --> 00:14:16,47
Sort of on along the line just
thinking oh yes this could be good.

166
00:14:18,13 --> 00:14:23,26
So why did you think.

167
00:14:23,28 --> 00:14:29,59
Well financially. Of course.
Financially i thought you know would.

168
00:14:30,96 --> 00:14:36,56
Help us all so what was his

169
00:14:40,64 --> 00:14:47,22
first name.

170
00:14:48,52 --> 00:14:52,05
There was a lot of
activity leading up to it.

171
00:14:53,20 --> 00:14:56,89
But not a great big.

172
00:14:56,91 --> 00:14:58,68
Lot of people arrive

173
00:14:58,68 --> 00:15:01,37
but there were a few running around
working on getting this together getting

174
00:15:01,37 --> 00:15:05,87
that the get a i think the first day
or so i don't think any of us realised

175
00:15:05,87 --> 00:15:09,27
that the nimbin would ever have as
many people in it you know coming in.

176
00:15:09,27 --> 00:15:11,01
Buses and what have you.

177
00:15:11,04 --> 00:15:17,17
And of course everybody was interested
interested to see what they look like and.

178
00:15:18,35 --> 00:15:24,15
Money that. First person.

179
00:15:24,92 --> 00:15:30,12
I was probably a little bit shocked
that the way they dressed and.

180
00:15:30,14 --> 00:15:36,27
You know the state of their
hair and you know shoes and all

181
00:15:36,27 --> 00:15:38,50
that sort of thing you
know it was probably

182
00:15:38,50 --> 00:15:44,60
but we could say i was shocked.

183
00:15:44,61 --> 00:15:49,67
After that.

184
00:15:49,69 --> 00:15:55,82
Well i made a lot of really nice people
and i got to like a lot of people.

185
00:15:55,84 --> 00:16:01,50
Made some good friends among
them. And. I sort of.

186
00:16:02,29 --> 00:16:05,43
There weren't as far as i'm
concerned and in my business.

187
00:16:05,76 --> 00:16:11,84
There wasn't a real lot of people who i
disliked there were a few but not many.

188
00:16:13,65 --> 00:16:16,48
I am i really did sort of get
on well with all of them

189
00:16:16,48 --> 00:16:21,21
and i think they go well with me too. So.

190
00:16:22,76 --> 00:16:25,63
It's gone.

191
00:16:27,29 --> 00:16:33,11
Well i don't have many memories all i did
was work i didn't get out into the field

192
00:16:33,11 --> 00:16:37,89
or out side my shop actually where we
work from 6 o'clock in the morning till 4

193
00:16:37,89 --> 00:16:41,88
o'clock in the morning
sometimes and. I was sort of.

194
00:16:43,27 --> 00:16:46,54
In the background or if i wasn't in
the shop was out the back organizing

195
00:16:46,54 --> 00:16:52,03
and so i sort of didn't see anything
much that went on in to the activities

196
00:16:52,03 --> 00:16:58,23
that went on at all. What was on the menu.

197
00:16:58,74 --> 00:17:02,96
Just sandwiches and
hamburgers and pies and.

198
00:17:02,98 --> 00:17:07,33
Just just a lot of junk takeaway type.

199
00:17:07,35 --> 00:17:10,93
But very very popular.

200
00:17:11,26 --> 00:17:14,71
Yes yes.

201
00:17:19,22 --> 00:17:21,88
Well it certainly boosted business.

202
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:28,01
We didn't make a real lot of money because
we had to pay too much away in way just

203
00:17:28,01 --> 00:17:34,35
to keep things flowing at an even rate
you know was very very busy to get

204
00:17:34,35 --> 00:17:38,33
that stage i had during the
festival i'm sorry 27 people.

205
00:17:39,40 --> 00:17:44,87
So i myself so. Money didn't.

206
00:17:44,89 --> 00:17:50,21
We made money but not a lot of money.

207
00:17:50,22 --> 00:17:55,62
Roll.

208
00:17:57,24 --> 00:17:59,58
Each time she worked.

209
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:06,73
Why yes i guess i had harry freeman
and this was after the festival.

210
00:18:08,67 --> 00:18:14,16
How if women had a few patients here
who who wouldn't take their medication

211
00:18:14,16 --> 00:18:15,70
and.

212
00:18:15,71 --> 00:18:21,31
A lady called murray sound and i sort
of took over the job of making sure

213
00:18:21,32 --> 00:18:25,78
that these people particular people we
knew we had their medication up on our

214
00:18:25,78 --> 00:18:27,53
cupboard and when they
come in of a morning.

215
00:18:28,04 --> 00:18:29,91
We lined them up and
gave them their medicine

216
00:18:29,91 --> 00:18:35,68
and whatever it's stay on probably on
a little bit of an even keel was of

217
00:18:37,09 --> 00:18:38,86
so.

218
00:18:41,01 --> 00:18:45,20
Schizophrenics mainly.

219
00:18:47,33 --> 00:18:49,35
Was sad to see them at times when.

220
00:18:49,83 --> 00:18:54,67
You know when they were
really off the beaten track.

221
00:18:54,69 --> 00:18:58,58
And it was only people in simply because
they weren't taking their medication.

222
00:18:59,31 --> 00:19:03,87
So we sort of tried to help
them out as much as possible.

223
00:19:04,18 --> 00:19:08,30
I don't know whether we were thank for
it or whether they appreciate that

224
00:19:08,30 --> 00:19:14,72
but we tried. Out of.

225
00:19:16,16 --> 00:19:20,54
Oh i think the town. Didn't believe that.

226
00:19:21,17 --> 00:19:26,53
As many people would stay here we
with well i personally thought.

227
00:19:27,48 --> 00:19:29,64
That serve as a festival was open.

228
00:19:29,64 --> 00:19:38,92
Everything was cleaned up everybody
would go didn't happen did it.

229
00:19:40,35 --> 00:19:43,95
And. Yes and i don't think they realized

230
00:19:43,95 --> 00:19:46,00
that people would want
to stay here either.

231
00:19:49,30 --> 00:19:52,32
So what do you.

232
00:19:53,04 --> 00:19:57,95
Changed my impression.

233
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,53
It's probably i don't like the
street scene at the moment

234
00:20:06,53 --> 00:20:10,17
i think that it's gradually
going down hill but whether

235
00:20:10,17 --> 00:20:19,24
that had anything to do with the aquarius
festival i don't know probably not.

236
00:20:19,98 --> 00:20:22,97
I think that in the
last 10 years with the.

237
00:20:22,99 --> 00:20:28,99
The scene in the street has
actually gone downhill.

238
00:20:30,27 --> 00:20:34,45
During the festival and i don't believe
that there were any heavy drugs here.

239
00:20:34,71 --> 00:20:39,97
The word drugs but i don't
think any heavy drugs

240
00:20:39,98 --> 00:20:43,73
and. I really.

241
00:20:44,17 --> 00:20:45,67
I'm a bit disappointed

242
00:20:45,67 --> 00:20:51,17
that the town has turned out like it has
you know i think the town's probably doing

243
00:20:51,17 --> 00:20:54,66
well financially as you know the
business are probably thriving now

244
00:20:55,73 --> 00:21:00,43
but for all the people it but are
here and who stayed here and.

245
00:21:01,84 --> 00:21:08,61
But. I don't just actually like what's
happening in town at the moment.

246
00:21:16,05 --> 00:21:21,99
Do you think.

247
00:21:22,71 --> 00:21:28,92
Is it a town.

248
00:21:28,93 --> 00:21:36,44
I don't really know whether it's a
it's a better town i think probably.

249
00:21:36,46 --> 00:21:40,58
In a lot in lots of ways it is i
guess because i mean there's more.

250
00:21:41,91 --> 00:21:45,24
Employment in the area
now more business and.

251
00:21:45,26 --> 00:21:49,78
And that sort of thing whether that
can be put down to the fact that.

252
00:21:50,51 --> 00:21:55,61
Was the queries first of all that
made that happen. I don't know.

253
00:21:56,45 --> 00:22:02,92
You know. Any. Like.

254
00:22:06,76 --> 00:22:10,71
I don't know. Probably would have died.

255
00:22:11,12 --> 00:22:14,12
I would say.

256
00:22:15,38 --> 00:22:19,01
It was certainly on the
downhill run before.

257
00:22:19,03 --> 00:22:25,21
As far as money making goes
you know the business area.

258
00:22:26,08 --> 00:22:29,38
I believe it was on the downhill run.

259
00:22:29,40 --> 00:22:35,59
But the general trend probably would have
brought different people here anyhow

260
00:22:35,59 --> 00:22:38,09
whether the cruise festival been held

261
00:22:38,09 --> 00:22:41,42
and not because all towns
all around the area.

262
00:22:41,52 --> 00:22:46,00
I believe of many different
settlers of come from the city

263
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:47,63
or younger people to get away from it.

264
00:22:47,63 --> 00:22:50,91
Also i think probably would have happened
to nimbleness in a certain extent

265
00:22:50,91 --> 00:22:56,65
anything. Was ever any thing.

266
00:22:56,67 --> 00:22:59,51
For me.

267
00:22:59,53 --> 00:23:04,60
Oh yes i still is.

268
00:23:09,35 --> 00:23:15,18
How do i say. Explain it. I mean.

269
00:23:15,20 --> 00:23:22,03
I know that. The still a lot of
the older residents sort of.

270
00:23:23,02 --> 00:23:24,97
Stand back when there's
any of them around.

271
00:23:25,15 --> 00:23:31,73
They don't like accepting them.
There has been a bit of animosity.

272
00:23:31,78 --> 00:23:36,60
You know times it's a flare ups of
arguments with different ones and.

273
00:23:36,62 --> 00:23:39,44
But.

274
00:23:39,46 --> 00:23:41,20
I don't sort of join in

275
00:23:41,20 --> 00:23:47,49
that scene anymore i don't sort of
really know what is happening. But.

276
00:23:49,23 --> 00:23:50,90
There used to be a lot of.

277
00:23:51,88 --> 00:23:57,05
Event agonies and between the hippies
in the states especially the guys

278
00:23:57,05 --> 00:23:59,89
that you to go to the pub
you know they had them.

279
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:02,30
The altercations and what
have you between them.

280
00:24:03,28 --> 00:24:05,95
So a lot of them uncalled for or believe

281
00:24:05,95 --> 00:24:12,29
but.

282
00:24:15,32 --> 00:24:20,37
Not really you know there's been so
many little incidents that them.

283
00:24:21,30 --> 00:24:25,34
You know i don't really remember anything
but you know you hear about them

284
00:24:25,34 --> 00:24:30,26
and you sometimes i had seen
them arguing and what have you.

285
00:24:31,89 --> 00:24:40,17
And.

286
00:24:41,63 --> 00:24:44,86
No no i never ever did. I
always got on well with them.

287
00:24:46,21 --> 00:24:51,89
I think i probably got more problems with
accepting. The people that are here now.

288
00:24:53,42 --> 00:24:59,06
Who are coming into the area now
that i mean they're not all bad.

289
00:24:59,08 --> 00:25:05,28
But i think i have more problem accepting
them now and i did back in 73.

290
00:25:05,30 --> 00:25:08,64
I think. Maybe it's not.

291
00:25:08,65 --> 00:25:12,82
But might be what i know about the me
or what i see and think i you know

292
00:25:12,82 --> 00:25:17,31
and you know that they're on drugs and

293
00:25:17,31 --> 00:25:20,67
that sort of thing i think
that's what i sort of.

294
00:25:20,68 --> 00:25:23,16
How i find it harder to accept them now.

295
00:25:24,47 --> 00:25:29,20
And i try and be friendly
and nice to all people.

296
00:25:29,28 --> 00:25:32,56
Anyhow whether they're whether
they're hippies all come straight

297
00:25:32,56 --> 00:25:35,47
or whatever supposed.

298
00:25:36,64 --> 00:25:39,33
Have you got any form

299
00:25:39,34 --> 00:25:45,36
and reasons for your story.

300
00:25:47,18 --> 00:25:53,07
And.

301
00:25:53,09 --> 00:25:54,65
Not really you know i can't.

302
00:25:54,82 --> 00:26:00,18
Sort of spur the moment i can't sort
of think of anything. You mean.

303
00:26:01,27 --> 00:26:03,29
During festival kyle
after first of all time.

304
00:26:03,46 --> 00:26:11,04
No.

305
00:26:13,22 --> 00:26:19,09
Oh dear. I don't really doubt one of
the funniest things i saw wasn't funny

306
00:26:19,09 --> 00:26:20,17
but it was amazing.

307
00:26:20,87 --> 00:26:24,94
There were so many people in my shop and i
was up and down behind the counter and.

308
00:26:25,44 --> 00:26:30,42
And the wall verona cream walls in this
particular room where they used to always

309
00:26:30,42 --> 00:26:36,39
go and sit need and. I went in
there. Halfway through the morning.

310
00:26:36,40 --> 00:26:39,84
One morning and they all got pictures
drawn painted all over them.

311
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:42,84
The artist come in with
their paints and brushes

312
00:26:42,84 --> 00:26:48,80
and painted pictures around the walls and
actually we left the mayor for years

313
00:26:48,80 --> 00:26:51,57
and years. I don't know where
they ever got to when the lady

314
00:26:51,57 --> 00:26:55,11
that bought the shop after they
had them pull down thrown away

315
00:26:55,11 --> 00:26:59,59
but there were some very good pictures
that that was sort of. Set me back.

316
00:26:59,75 --> 00:27:02,78
I think oh goodness me that didn't
take long for that to happen.

317
00:27:03,35 --> 00:27:04,74
That was interesting

318
00:27:04,74 --> 00:27:11,25
and i can't really think
of too not too much.

319
00:27:11,27 --> 00:27:14,89
Lost.

320
00:27:14,90 --> 00:27:21,39
I think so.

321
00:27:21,41 --> 00:27:27,83
How much.

322
00:27:28,69 --> 00:27:33,70
Probably didn't change that much
straight away but a guy came in

323
00:27:33,70 --> 00:27:38,11
and painted all pictures on the rooms
and on the front of the shops and

324
00:27:38,11 --> 00:27:40,45
that sort of thing. But

325
00:27:40,46 --> 00:27:47,15
that was sometime after
wasn't straightaway. So.

326
00:27:47,17 --> 00:27:51,99
How about. You know. Children.

327
00:27:52,00 --> 00:27:58,56
Yes i had all my youngest
boy was one year old

328
00:27:59,64 --> 00:28:00,99
during. First of all time and.

329
00:28:02,34 --> 00:28:08,89
I'd two girls who lived with me
and another son who was he was

330
00:28:08,89 --> 00:28:12,20
that age.

331
00:28:13,03 --> 00:28:19,76
They got a lot out of the festival. And
so they would say the one year old did.

332
00:28:19,77 --> 00:28:23,64
But the girls did they they
made heaps of friends and

333
00:28:24,43 --> 00:28:27,83
and sort of joined in activities when
they were had time off from the shop

334
00:28:27,83 --> 00:28:31,37
and they really enjoyed
actually just being

335
00:28:31,37 --> 00:28:34,22
that last night you know they were both.

336
00:28:34,24 --> 00:28:38,88
One more so than the other said that
they are glad they experienced it.

337
00:28:39,04 --> 00:28:41,20
You know and that she
was a little bit older

338
00:28:41,20 --> 00:28:46,62
and was old enough to probably appreciate
what was happening around the other one

339
00:28:47,63 --> 00:28:50,02
didn't sort of. Appreciate it as much

340
00:28:50,02 --> 00:28:54,43
but she she said she's glad
she experienced it too.

341
00:28:54,57 --> 00:29:04,18
So what about.

342
00:29:05,22 --> 00:29:07,71
They grew up and.

343
00:29:07,73 --> 00:29:14,38
Yes and we didn't stop them from
associating with the new settlers

344
00:29:14,38 --> 00:29:19,71
or you know they to go visit people who
had their dinners and their places.

345
00:29:19,80 --> 00:29:26,26
I think probably by letter
after letting them do that.

346
00:29:27,96 --> 00:29:32,93
It sort of opened their eyes as
to what can happen to people

347
00:29:32,93 --> 00:29:38,03
and none of them ever ever
wanted to sort of go in

348
00:29:38,03 --> 00:29:44,37
that direction they. I think
they could probably see.

349
00:29:44,39 --> 00:29:46,96
You know that's all. But
that life not for me.

350
00:29:47,83 --> 00:29:53,06
You know they had the opportunity to do
it if they wanted to but they didn't so.

351
00:29:54,13 --> 00:29:59,95
When you told. Oh well you
know. Just just living in a.

352
00:30:01,56 --> 00:30:05,37
And. Not combing your hair and.

353
00:30:05,39 --> 00:30:09,25
Going shoeless and that sort of thing

354
00:30:09,25 --> 00:30:15,12
that yes i think they sort of well
you know i don't want to do that.

355
00:30:15,13 --> 00:30:19,02
I you know they had the
opportunity to do it.

356
00:30:19,08 --> 00:30:23,25
Had they wanted to but none
of them had wanted to go on.

357
00:30:23,38 --> 00:30:29,56
I'm actually glad about
that. And you know.

358
00:30:29,98 --> 00:30:33,37
Another generation.

359
00:30:35,37 --> 00:30:41,46
There's the children of the query and
yes there's quite a few of them.

360
00:30:41,48 --> 00:30:48,04
I can't call recall. Any special one.

361
00:30:48,05 --> 00:30:49,27
But there are a lot of youngsters

362
00:30:50,11 --> 00:30:53,85
and there's a lot of youngsters who
have done well for themselves too

363
00:30:53,85 --> 00:30:58,52
and there's a lot that haven't and
who don't want to you know that.

364
00:30:59,60 --> 00:31:02,13
Age group so.

365
00:31:03,17 --> 00:31:06,02
They're happy to live on the streets
call themselves street kids

366
00:31:06,02 --> 00:31:10,83
but biggest majority of their parents
live here anyhow so i don't believe

367
00:31:10,83 --> 00:31:15,39
that there's even call a street kid a street
kid if their parents live in the area.

368
00:31:15,48 --> 00:31:20,02
I think that they've got parents
that's what they should be.

369
00:31:23,07 --> 00:31:29,21
I mean how you judge.

370
00:31:30,45 --> 00:31:33,11
How do i judge. Do you see the.
