he'll be there. I've seen him. You have
seen him. That's good. You'll see him

24
00:02:31,96 --> 00:02:36,37
do you remember any accidents while you
were working there you know in the shops it

25
00:02:36,37 --> 00:02:42,74
was no serious accidents i can recall where
did you come from originally. I come

26
00:02:42,74 --> 00:02:48,55
from london and how did you get out here
working on the boats and i paid for out

27
00:02:48,55 --> 00:02:55,41
here. It paid off and
nation around two or three

28
00:02:55,41 --> 00:03:02,38
places and both work and paid off. And

29
00:03:04,87 --> 00:03:11,62
i got to know. David and
dave gray as another

30
00:03:11,62 --> 00:03:17,49
maker steve over and cousin
and i got yes and i got me

31
00:03:17,49 --> 00:03:24,42
a job with them. Was it
hard work in those days

32
00:03:25,32 --> 00:03:31,58
it wasn't hard work. It was flat out
it all depends on the repeater the

33
00:03:33,87 --> 00:03:39,80
joke statements and i think
his name was. And scotchman

34
00:03:41,23 --> 00:03:47,73
and i used to go flat out and that and
of course it went to arguments. It was

35
00:03:47,73 --> 00:03:54,65
a bit slow. If the river. Got too cold and
i could knock it down. Where you working

36
00:03:54,65 --> 00:04:01,58
on the hydraulic rivers or the
pneumatic rubicon. I drive like

37
00:04:02,34 --> 00:04:04,92
it's a big horseshoe
gantry was it are now in

38
00:04:04,92 --> 00:04:11,54
a hangar and pike on hand. The
compressed air ones. Yes compressed air

39
00:04:13,54 --> 00:04:20,36
and do you remember use that to keep flatten
out although did you know you. Brakes

40
00:04:20,36 --> 00:04:27,05
and that when they shifted the job but
eventually it was all assembled in

41
00:04:27,06 --> 00:04:32,16
a workshop you had so many

42
00:04:34,32 --> 00:04:39,35
people into. And that when they came
without a crane to shift you had

43
00:04:39,35 --> 00:04:45,11
a break. Understand. Do you remember getting
burned at all with the flying rivets.

44
00:04:45,35 --> 00:04:50,74
Now that an ever got burnt
so we say shoot with

45
00:04:50,74 --> 00:04:57,42
a good cone collapse and that and sometimes
to the tune it get hot. You know.

46
00:04:59,41 --> 00:05:01,36
And what sort of tongs
did you pull it out with

47
00:05:03,85 --> 00:05:09,86
a pair. I don't know but it could rip it
tongs and that the pieces are bent and you

48
00:05:09,86 --> 00:05:16,52
picked it up say you put it in the
hole and then i read it down.

49
00:05:19,28 --> 00:05:22,57
Do you remember anything or any of the
amusing incidents in the workshops while you

50
00:05:22,57 --> 00:05:28,90
were there. You know there's
those days you never read

51
00:05:28,90 --> 00:05:35,64
amusement. So anything. It was flat out
working and that there was no loud ups.

52
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:41,90
Like there is pressure today. How long
were you working in the workshops the

53
00:05:45,38 --> 00:05:51,62
three or four years. And what was paid off

54
00:05:52,77 --> 00:05:54,87
before the break loose.
