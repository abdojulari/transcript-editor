1
00:00:12,53 --> 00:00:13,62
The strength i can starting it

2
00:00:16,81 --> 00:00:20,21
and i mean by watching a lot of these
kind of derelicts and and people like

3
00:00:20,21 --> 00:00:21,11
that in the street

4
00:00:21,11 --> 00:00:24,17
and especially there's one guy called
tree who i'm sure you'll hear about time

5
00:00:24,17 --> 00:00:25,50
and time again and.

6
00:00:26,14 --> 00:00:29,45
He would sit in the street and
sort of try and beg from people

7
00:00:29,45 --> 00:00:30,65
and just talk to himself.

8
00:00:30,94 --> 00:00:35,92
This is actually quite insane and the
money that is to get from his daltex

9
00:00:35,92 --> 00:00:39,76
and from begging from people he would
line up in rows of sort of one

10
00:00:39,76 --> 00:00:42,10
and to think lines or ten
cent pieces in the street

11
00:00:42,10 --> 00:00:44,12
and he would count his way along them.

12
00:00:44,62 --> 00:00:48,40
And and work out whether he was actually
going to have enough to buy a flag and

13
00:00:48,40 --> 00:00:51,30
that day and he would kind of put a
marker further up in the street.

14
00:00:51,31 --> 00:00:54,37
I mean the watch him do it quite clearly
he put a marker a piece of wood.

15
00:00:54,73 --> 00:00:58,04
Where his coins would have to get to in
order for him to be able to afford this

16
00:00:58,04 --> 00:01:00,76
flag and i just thought well this
really is a desperate situation isn't.

17
00:01:00,93 --> 00:01:03,87
I mean i had you know $2 50
and i've hock it myself to go

18
00:01:03,87 --> 00:01:05,98
and buy lollies whether you
know that wasn't a problem

19
00:01:05,98 --> 00:01:07,86
but this guy just didn't
have a under control

20
00:01:07,86 --> 00:01:11,03
and i'm there are a lot of people
like that who are kind of sit

21
00:01:11,03 --> 00:01:14,00
and have really slow kind of.

22
00:01:14,01 --> 00:01:17,66
Meaningless arguments in the street and
they would never raise their voices

23
00:01:17,66 --> 00:01:20,61
or actually get animated or anything
like that they would just sit there

24
00:01:20,61 --> 00:01:23,45
and argue it out all day and get
really in-depth about everything.

25
00:01:23,72 --> 00:01:27,16
And then i rember other people who just
kind of sit there with their guitar

26
00:01:27,16 --> 00:01:31,91
or with their bongos and not play
them for hours and you know you

27
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:35,01
and so you walk past some really hairy guy
you sitting there looking at his guitar

28
00:01:35,01 --> 00:01:36,61
and he hasn't worked out yet.

29
00:01:36,82 --> 00:01:39,49
You know that he's he's not
playing or that he can't play it.

30
00:01:39,54 --> 00:01:41,15
You know just keep you
know just keep going

31
00:01:41,98 --> 00:01:45,92
and i don't know if i remember the way
you know when people see every stone

32
00:01:45,92 --> 00:01:49,06
and sort of dance around and
they were getting right into it

33
00:01:49,06 --> 00:01:50,24
and feeling really good about everything

34
00:01:50,24 --> 00:01:53,68
and kind of you know makes everyone
feel a little bit uncomfortable.

35
00:01:54,06 --> 00:01:58,32
These people are doing this because it's
there's something really lost about it

36
00:01:58,32 --> 00:01:59,24
and you know.

37
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,47
Remember a lot of sort of messy situations
where people would would fight about

38
00:02:03,47 --> 00:02:06,29
money or about something
like that and then

39
00:02:06,29 --> 00:02:09,09
and i would see another person
come in and settle it all down

40
00:02:09,79 --> 00:02:12,99
and like see see people being
treated like children all the time

41
00:02:12,99 --> 00:02:16,57
and that's really funny thing because you
know it's like in all communities where

42
00:02:16,57 --> 00:02:19,27
whenever things blow up there are
always people are step in and try

43
00:02:19,27 --> 00:02:22,41
and sort them out and so the
same nimbin when you know

44
00:02:22,41 --> 00:02:26,26
when the situation on the street got
out of hand people would step in

45
00:02:26,26 --> 00:02:29,01
and diffuse it all and sort
of pat everyone on the back

46
00:02:29,01 --> 00:02:32,17
and say you know it's ok you don't
have to worry about it and you know.

47
00:02:32,48 --> 00:02:37,56
As often as not these situations would
just sort of die down straight away.

48
00:02:37,58 --> 00:02:42,23
And i mean you know people probably have
an image of the place as being very kind

49
00:02:42,23 --> 00:02:45,75
of nasty and violent and i
really dark side to all of that

50
00:02:45,75 --> 00:02:48,73
but it is have to remember that it's
people trying to get on with their thing

51
00:02:49,68 --> 00:02:52,68
and that those situations can you know
can actually be resolved as well.

52
00:02:54,55 --> 00:02:57,60
Yeah and i mean.

53
00:02:57,61 --> 00:03:02,48
I don't know the other thing is like even
all of those families like ours that

54
00:03:02,48 --> 00:03:05,67
when i moved out there and lived in a
half built tent or something like that.

55
00:03:05,72 --> 00:03:09,49
You know we always had
sort of food and beds

56
00:03:09,49 --> 00:03:12,61
and our own sort of domestic
situation sorted out you know

57
00:03:12,61 --> 00:03:15,05
and there's this whole
other group of people

58
00:03:15,05 --> 00:03:19,64
that i haven't really talked about yet the
kind of feral people who have chosen to

59
00:03:19,64 --> 00:03:24,77
live a completely kind of feral existence
up in the bushes with no kind of you know

60
00:03:24,77 --> 00:03:27,00
civilized housing or any
of that type of thing

61
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:28,71
and then they get really really dirty

62
00:03:28,71 --> 00:03:33,67
and they live in a really really primitive
way and it's funny because i know

63
00:03:33,67 --> 00:03:35,51
that they're living in a primitive way and

64
00:03:35,51 --> 00:03:39,50
that they're not sort of you know having
any kind of western you know material

65
00:03:39,50 --> 00:03:41,67
things around them or anything
like that but then again.

66
00:03:42,24 --> 00:03:44,71
They're doing it as a reaction
to the western way of living

67
00:03:44,71 --> 00:03:48,54
and so what they're doing is kind of like
anti-western living as opposed to just a

68
00:03:48,54 --> 00:03:52,53
natural instinct to feral way of living
which say indigenous people would do

69
00:03:54,03 --> 00:03:56,29
and it's really funny to see the lengths

70
00:03:56,29 --> 00:03:59,94
that they have to go to in order to
maintain a kind of really simple.

71
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,65
All and and unconscious type
of lifestyle and you know

72
00:04:05,47 --> 00:04:08,19
that the whole thing about you
know having a car for example

73
00:04:08,19 --> 00:04:11,17
and one of them always have a car because
eventually they're going to have to go

74
00:04:11,17 --> 00:04:14,86
somewhere and and you know but
they like to sort of pretend

75
00:04:14,86 --> 00:04:17,56
that they don't have a car
and they don't need any of

76
00:04:17,56 --> 00:04:21,64
that type of stuff coming here. And.

77
00:04:23,14 --> 00:04:26,28
And so you've got these kind of groups of
people making a massive effort to live in

78
00:04:26,28 --> 00:04:29,76
a really kind of simple way and going
out of their way to do it continuously

79
00:04:29,76 --> 00:04:33,24
and in my whole life i've never actually
stopped to think why they were doing it

80
00:04:33,24 --> 00:04:37,38
because like there are some things like
pornography and you know advertising

81
00:04:37,38 --> 00:04:41,26
and things like that which i really
dislike about our consumeristic society.

82
00:04:41,43 --> 00:04:45,99
But then there you know all of the rest of
it seems quite acceptable to me whether

83
00:04:45,99 --> 00:04:48,92
you take it on as a really serious type
of thing whether you just do it without

84
00:04:48,92 --> 00:04:53,35
thinking about it and so i don't see
what actually requires that effort.

85
00:04:53,36 --> 00:04:59,61
So the roses.

86
00:05:00,66 --> 00:05:01,99
Well you know there's that.

87
00:05:02,01 --> 00:05:04,13
Yeah there's also the dilemma that
they are trying to be self-sufficient.

88
00:05:04,58 --> 00:05:06,60
But in the end they're going to
need to get some money somehow.

89
00:05:06,87 --> 00:05:11,55
And so they can rely on society
to support them or they can try

90
00:05:11,55 --> 00:05:13,34
and produce something
that's all value. Ok.

91
00:05:13,67 --> 00:05:14,52
And when they you know

92
00:05:14,52 --> 00:05:16,47
when they produce those things like
the things they sell at the markets

93
00:05:16,47 --> 00:05:18,13
and stuff like that they try

94
00:05:18,13 --> 00:05:21,32
and do in the most organic kind of
you know down to earth possible way

95
00:05:21,32 --> 00:05:26,39
but they're still relying on a very kind
of you know western society approach to

96
00:05:26,39 --> 00:05:28,48
doing the whole thing in
order to make it work.

97
00:05:28,51 --> 00:05:31,81
And so you know even though they they
are living alternative lifestyles.

98
00:05:31,91 --> 00:05:34,23
They should you know be
careful to acknowledge

99
00:05:34,23 --> 00:05:38,11
that they're still kind of participating
in our mainstream society and

100
00:05:38,11 --> 00:05:39,97
that it's still sort of you know tourists

101
00:05:39,97 --> 00:05:42,28
and those kind of people who
are buying their things

102
00:05:42,28 --> 00:05:43,83
and supporting their lifestyle.

103
00:05:43,84 --> 00:05:45,50
You know as removed

104
00:05:45,50 --> 00:05:52,28
and as simple as they think they might be.

105
00:05:55,54 --> 00:05:59,77
Oh yeah well there was this guy who was
there was this guy who was there before.

106
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,99
All i arrived. Who was convinced that
aliens when we're going to come down

107
00:06:03,99 --> 00:06:06,86
and sort of you know
save the whole planet.

108
00:06:08,24 --> 00:06:10,76
And it was going to happen on this
particular night in this particular place

109
00:06:10,76 --> 00:06:14,43
and you took a whole lot of people
there and they stayed up or mine

110
00:06:14,43 --> 00:06:16,53
and watched a couple of
satellites going overhead

111
00:06:16,53 --> 00:06:20,55
and we're almost convinced at one stage
but no then it all kind of fell down.

112
00:06:20,58 --> 00:06:24,16
I mean it was one of those classic things
where the actual event didn't take place

113
00:06:24,16 --> 00:06:26,02
but the purpose of the event.

114
00:06:26,09 --> 00:06:29,08
You know was just as powerful anyway because
all these people were actually brought

115
00:06:29,08 --> 00:06:32,33
together by it and you know and
something started through and

116
00:06:32,33 --> 00:06:33,28
that was out of my line bimby

117
00:06:33,28 --> 00:06:36,22
and you know they ended up starting
some really good communes out there

118
00:06:36,22 --> 00:06:38,03
and you know he was a
big part of all of that

119
00:06:38,03 --> 00:06:42,45
but just you know a lot of those kind
of trippers who make everyone stop

120
00:06:42,45 --> 00:06:45,66
and listen to their story about whether
it's aliens or about armageddon

121
00:06:45,66 --> 00:06:50,85
or whatever you know have all got this
sort of thing in common with all they want

122
00:06:50,85 --> 00:06:53,62
is for everyone to gather around
and listen to their story.

123
00:06:53,64 --> 00:06:56,46
But the actual contents of the story
are usually completely meaningless

124
00:06:56,46 --> 00:07:01,12
or you know completely nonsense.

125
00:07:01,14 --> 00:07:04,71
Yeah.

126
00:07:04,73 --> 00:07:10,94
I'm putting forward to you my my
proposition that it's the police

127
00:07:10,94 --> 00:07:17,06
that are largely responsible
for the overwhelming

128
00:07:18,35 --> 00:07:23,32
presence of the hard drug scene in
nimbin at the moment i mean i believe

129
00:07:23,32 --> 00:07:25,83
that it's just there are too many of them.

130
00:07:25,85 --> 00:07:30,56
I mean there's bound to be a small number
of people using narcotics in any culture

131
00:07:31,43 --> 00:07:32,76
at the moment in australia

132
00:07:32,76 --> 00:07:38,28
and particularly in a culture where the
other drugs are such an integral part of

133
00:07:38,28 --> 00:07:43,64
the community but the policing
is the problem at neiman

134
00:07:43,64 --> 00:07:47,15
and i think the policing the reason

135
00:07:47,15 --> 00:07:50,64
that the police won't police
nimbin is a very simple one

136
00:07:50,64 --> 00:07:51,85
and it relates to their envy.

137
00:07:53,04 --> 00:07:58,94
Envy is a is a very basic human feeling
like anger and avarice and sloth

138
00:07:58,94 --> 00:08:05,08
and the other seven dead. These
since. Envy is ubiquitous.

139
00:08:05,10 --> 00:08:07,94
I personally feel that it was envy

140
00:08:08,83 --> 00:08:14,02
that was the problem on our commune that
made it impossible for us to share.

141
00:08:15,22 --> 00:08:19,70
I think it was not possible for some of
the other people not to envy the way i

142
00:08:19,70 --> 00:08:21,51
could easily make money

143
00:08:22,81 --> 00:08:28,18
and at this distorted in all sorts
of complicated ways the things

144
00:08:28,18 --> 00:08:34,97
that was going down. But i think the envy
that the police feel for those of us

145
00:08:34,97 --> 00:08:40,27
that nimbin is very very deep and very
very profound for the first few years

146
00:08:40,27 --> 00:08:44,27
when i had this wonderful relationship
with the one policeman in town.

147
00:08:44,31 --> 00:08:47,19
I think that the situation
was very very different

148
00:08:48,34 --> 00:08:53,53
but then he actually left the town because
he couldn't cope with just how ambiguous

149
00:08:53,53 --> 00:08:56,40
and complicated it was he was a
lovely guy but he said himself.

150
00:08:56,74 --> 00:08:59,50
I can't go on with this
amount of ambiguity

151
00:08:59,50 --> 00:09:03,65
and i know i my kids to be growing up in
a drug town like this. I've got to go.

152
00:09:03,67 --> 00:09:08,80
And from then on we had a succession
of policemen and policewomen.

153
00:09:09,85 --> 00:09:13,67
In various numbers coming
there who i think.

154
00:09:13,69 --> 00:09:20,39
Really hated name and they hate and
envy people like me they hate.

155
00:09:20,82 --> 00:09:23,63
And to some extent envy
people who are on the dole

156
00:09:24,60 --> 00:09:29,03
and who can grow enough
to run a car on the dole

157
00:09:29,03 --> 00:09:35,58
and live a pretty comfortable
lifestyle not a wonderful lifestyle

158
00:09:35,58 --> 00:09:37,98
but the lifestyle of the average
policeman with a mortgage

159
00:09:37,98 --> 00:09:41,69
and all of those things is not
all that bloody comfortable.

160
00:09:41,89 --> 00:09:47,29
So the sight of a bunch of people
on the dole still driving a car.

161
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:54,95
And never working the bunch of a
the sight of people like me who

162
00:09:54,95 --> 00:09:59,86
can cross the boundaries between
the professional groupings.

163
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,80
And and the tribe out there and
live a comfortable lifestyle

164
00:10:03,80 --> 00:10:05,60
and maybe even drive a sports car.

165
00:10:05,92 --> 00:10:10,22
I think that the police are
tremendously envious of.

166
00:10:10,24 --> 00:10:13,91
Most of the aspects of
the nimbin phenomenon.

167
00:10:15,29 --> 00:10:17,31
Therefore.

168
00:10:17,33 --> 00:10:22,78
They will not do what they
would do in any other place

169
00:10:22,78 --> 00:10:26,53
when it comes to crime. I
think they rather feel it.

170
00:10:26,53 --> 00:10:28,11
We should do you in our own shit.

171
00:10:29,64 --> 00:10:35,49
Firstly they can always justify their
inactivity with respect to the hard drugs by

172
00:10:35,49 --> 00:10:39,70
saying are you. But you just want
us to bust the narcotics people

173
00:10:39,70 --> 00:10:41,85
and a lay off you doped smokers

174
00:10:41,85 --> 00:10:45,34
and of course that's not what
a policeman espouse to do so.

175
00:10:45,66 --> 00:10:48,14
All right will lay off the dope smokers

176
00:10:48,14 --> 00:10:51,34
but don't you expect us
then to be discriminating.

177
00:10:51,72 --> 00:10:56,39
That's not what a policeman is supposed to
do so they have a rational a rationale a

178
00:10:56,39 --> 00:11:01,90
rationalization for going easy
on the more obvious narcotic.

179
00:11:02,50 --> 00:11:07,84
Dealing and using that goes on in
town but that's just the rationale.

180
00:11:08,56 --> 00:11:13,18
What's behind it is they hate
that place. They hate the end.

181
00:11:13,22 --> 00:11:17,39
They've always hated the
intelligentsia. They hate the artists.

182
00:11:17,40 --> 00:11:20,05
I mean that's not what a
policeman is about policemen

183
00:11:20,05 --> 00:11:24,82
and not about the finer things in life
policemen by choice actually come into

184
00:11:24,82 --> 00:11:28,05
contact with some of the most disastrous
human beings in the community

185
00:11:28,05 --> 00:11:32,11
and i've got a vile job and i'm not
saying that they're envy is unique.

186
00:11:32,15 --> 00:11:37,28
I've just said that envy i think
fucked up my community but i think

187
00:11:37,28 --> 00:11:40,66
that in this particular case
it is the envy of the police

188
00:11:41,40 --> 00:11:47,27
that forces them into a particular
level of inactivity which then ensures

189
00:11:47,27 --> 00:11:49,98
that we have a very special
drug problem in them.

190
00:11:51,33 --> 00:11:54,92
They will not police that town and
i will not walk around that town.

191
00:11:55,19 --> 00:11:59,93
The police department will
not put on. And after.

192
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,73
For them to just walk around
the town. There's a certain.

193
00:12:03,74 --> 00:12:10,73
Sort of overt drug use which
just couldn't happen if there

194
00:12:10,73 --> 00:12:15,27
was a policeman walking by gleason doesn't
have to even do anything he just has to

195
00:12:15,27 --> 00:12:21,18
be there or she has to be there. They
won't do that in them they just won't.

196
00:12:21,20 --> 00:12:24,15
And i say well that's because we'd
have to book the dope smokers

197
00:12:24,15 --> 00:12:25,12
but that's not the case.

198
00:12:26,30 --> 00:12:30,37
Well firstly they wouldn't have to they
could actually be discriminating policemen

199
00:12:30,37 --> 00:12:34,15
of discriminating all the time they
don't bust each other for speeding.

200
00:12:35,64 --> 00:12:38,55
So we're up against it in him and.

201
00:12:39,62 --> 00:12:40,23
With the fact

202
00:12:40,23 --> 00:12:45,97
that the police are not giving us a fair
deal about hard drug users just not

203
00:12:45,97 --> 00:12:50,09
policing it. And that's because
they want us to steer our own shit.

204
00:12:51,97 --> 00:13:14,33
Whatever you know.

205
00:13:15,47 --> 00:13:19,14
Well i still don't think they can do
it without the police cooperation.

206
00:13:19,29 --> 00:13:20,28
Yes it is true

207
00:13:20,28 --> 00:13:23,55
that we've never been able to draw lines
although i've never been able to draw

208
00:13:23,55 --> 00:13:27,07
lines in nimbin. And you know that.

209
00:13:28,09 --> 00:13:32,84
They have always been in difficulty in
finally deciding that x is gone too far.

210
00:13:34,18 --> 00:13:38,72
Unless it's. That x has gone too far
in a fir to some sort of leadership.

211
00:13:39,22 --> 00:13:42,07
If effects begins to assert something

212
00:13:42,07 --> 00:13:45,29
that might be interpreted as leadership
they've got the shit kicked out of the

213
00:13:45,29 --> 00:13:45,90
mediately

214
00:13:46,81 --> 00:13:49,76
but if you go too far with respect to
sitting in the middle of the main street

215
00:13:49,76 --> 00:13:52,89
or anything like that it would be very
hard for newman to draw the line.

216
00:13:53,20 --> 00:13:59,21
So yes obviously enough. There's
a potential for for. Serious.

217
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,22
A legal drug users too.

218
00:14:05,24 --> 00:14:10,62
To parade themselves in nimbin without
getting the usual public condemnation

219
00:14:11,84 --> 00:14:14,07
that might keep them in
order but i don't think

220
00:14:14,07 --> 00:14:16,11
that we could do anything in nimbin about

221
00:14:16,11 --> 00:14:19,21
that problem unless the
police actually came clean

222
00:14:20,33 --> 00:14:23,43
and the police are playing it very dirty
in the embed and they always have.

223
00:14:26,12 --> 00:14:33,65
Yes.

224
00:14:34,48 --> 00:14:41,11
We.

225
00:14:41,13 --> 00:14:45,97
Yeah now i'm not i'm not
happy about the way

226
00:14:45,97 --> 00:14:52,45
that continues to be a
feature of name and life.

227
00:14:53,45 --> 00:15:00,15
It is the i mean it's a
movie again. Yeah yeah.

228
00:15:01,16 --> 00:15:03,59
I feel that the way in
which leadership is.

229
00:15:04,26 --> 00:15:11,12
Dissolved dispersed denied in name is
another real example of just what a

230
00:15:11,12 --> 00:15:17,68
very very important part in human affairs
in the play is of course once again

231
00:15:17,68 --> 00:15:22,92
there is a rationale for it in nimbin
you know if everybody's to be free

232
00:15:22,92 --> 00:15:26,46
and autonomous and and where
to have a real anarchy then.

233
00:15:26,75 --> 00:15:30,93
Obviously enough no one should leave
because they would have to impose their

234
00:15:30,93 --> 00:15:35,34
particular style on other
people and. That is you know.

235
00:15:35,75 --> 00:15:41,62
Then the false rationales
for tearing down leaders.

236
00:15:42,01 --> 00:15:46,04
It's in it's in the interests
of anarchy and real autonomy

237
00:15:46,04 --> 00:15:50,10
that we have to get rid of the sorts
of people who want to be leaders

238
00:15:50,90 --> 00:15:53,76
but i've already said that i
think that that's a disaster.

239
00:15:54,15 --> 00:15:59,85
And that's not right but i also
believe that the tearing down of.

240
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,45
Leaders is. You know the
prime the cardinal example.

241
00:16:05,47 --> 00:16:07,43
Of australia's.

242
00:16:07,45 --> 00:16:13,05
Endemic of a stray liens
endemic envy which is

243
00:16:13,05 --> 00:16:16,31
that which runs very deep in all stray
liens may have something to do with our

244
00:16:16,31 --> 00:16:21,01
convict background or something but
i think it is it's a bad thing.

245
00:16:21,02 --> 00:16:23,75
It would be wonderful
if we could overcome.

246
00:16:23,77 --> 00:16:30,17
And we will won't overcome it until we
acknowledge just how many areas of life.

247
00:16:30,19 --> 00:16:31,91
Of our own personal lives

248
00:16:31,91 --> 00:16:38,70
and of our larger lives as a community
until we acknowledge how deeply envy

249
00:16:38,70 --> 00:16:40,71
pervades our community.

250
00:16:40,77 --> 00:16:47,24
So paul newman has not managed
to transient the problem that.

251
00:16:47,79 --> 00:16:51,87
You know. I think bedevils
all of australia.

252
00:16:51,89 --> 00:16:56,11
With respect to the tall poppy syndrome
nim and hasn't transcended that

253
00:16:56,11 --> 00:17:00,84
and simply because you know nimbin
have interpreted anarchy and

254
00:17:01,67 --> 00:17:06,88
and freedom as meaning there would not
be and they would not need to be leaders

255
00:17:06,88 --> 00:17:10,12
and i of course believe that
that's complete nonsense i think

256
00:17:10,12 --> 00:17:16,98
that we have to have inspirational
human beings around us in order to

257
00:17:16,98 --> 00:17:18,28
be inspired

258
00:17:19,24 --> 00:17:25,19
and in order to radiate light ourselves
we need to be exposed to radiant

259
00:17:26,06 --> 00:17:26,67
beings.

260
00:17:26,96 --> 00:17:32,16
There have been a lot of people at nimbin
who are pretty radiant sort of creatures

261
00:17:32,16 --> 00:17:37,75
and they do get a pretty rough time.

262
00:17:46,65 --> 00:17:50,08
Yeah well. Yes yes.

263
00:17:50,16 --> 00:17:56,91
Meetings have been a feature of nimbin
and they have taken the same form.

264
00:17:57,10 --> 00:17:59,84
You know from day one where.

265
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,16
Anybody who attempted to take a
real leadership role as. Has come.

266
00:18:06,36 --> 00:18:12,04
Has come adrift and where everybody
you know has the right to be heard

267
00:18:12,95 --> 00:18:19,47
and there's some aspect of that which
i really appreciate i think that.

268
00:18:20,26 --> 00:18:23,94
I'm. Actually i'm i.

269
00:18:23,96 --> 00:18:25,82
I'm not a member of the quakers

270
00:18:25,82 --> 00:18:32,09
but i am a quaker i'm a regular attender
at quaker meetings and you may know

271
00:18:32,09 --> 00:18:38,52
that quite as were the first
group of people to enshrine

272
00:18:38,53 --> 00:18:43,72
consensus as the most appropriate
way of decision making.

273
00:18:45,35 --> 00:18:48,28
Well i really do appreciate
the fact that it and him

274
00:18:48,28 --> 00:18:54,96
and there is an attempt always to to
find some sort of consensus in meeting.

275
00:18:54,97 --> 00:18:59,37
Now of course just as with the
quakers i mean you will notice

276
00:18:59,37 --> 00:19:03,01
that you don't know many quakers
they're not a very evangelical bunch

277
00:19:03,01 --> 00:19:07,31
and they're very quiet and very low profile
and usually very beautiful people.

278
00:19:07,50 --> 00:19:10,18
But it certainly isn't a movement
that's taken over the world and

279
00:19:10,18 --> 00:19:12,64
that is undoubtedly.

280
00:19:12,65 --> 00:19:18,18
A consequence of their commitment to
this fascinating process of consensus

281
00:19:19,12 --> 00:19:22,16
and that's what everybody tries for
at all of the meetings in nimbin

282
00:19:22,16 --> 00:19:25,00
and just as the quakers will
never take over the world.

283
00:19:25,33 --> 00:19:26,01
There's no doubt

284
00:19:26,01 --> 00:19:28,75
that what it is that's happening at neiman
will never take over the world because

285
00:19:28,75 --> 00:19:32,12
of their commitment to
everybody being heard

286
00:19:33,48 --> 00:19:37,35
and particularly everybody trying to.

287
00:19:37,36 --> 00:19:42,55
You know to come from their higher self
in their communications with other people

288
00:19:42,55 --> 00:19:49,12
but it does mean that you have
to listen to some arseholes.

289
00:19:49,14 --> 00:19:55,78
And that certainly you know
bogs down the process.

290
00:19:56,58 --> 00:19:59,45
My pleasure and privilege.
