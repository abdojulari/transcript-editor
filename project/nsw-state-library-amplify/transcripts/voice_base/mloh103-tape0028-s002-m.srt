1
00:00:12,43 --> 00:00:14,11
Right. Being gay and being here

2
00:00:14,11 --> 00:00:20,81
and bill includes both part of the
reason for me coming here would probably

3
00:00:20,81 --> 00:00:25,13
be most sexuality in that at
the time living in queensland

4
00:00:25,13 --> 00:00:30,09
and if you know in a structure which
still hadn't accepted homosexuality.

5
00:00:30,55 --> 00:00:36,79
It was restrictive and i guess
i felt that i couldn't see why

6
00:00:36,79 --> 00:00:42,46
that should be me why i had to go through
all that bullshit then coming here.

7
00:00:43,77 --> 00:00:49,11
And still i suppose in there is
i think you know sort of that.

8
00:00:49,13 --> 00:00:52,87
You do have to be careful that sense
of you know survival thing where you.

9
00:00:53,14 --> 00:00:56,15
You know if you care if you test the
water out before you jump in it.

10
00:00:58,35 --> 00:01:01,81
But then thinking of like you know these
are all people you know finding out

11
00:01:01,81 --> 00:01:04,31
that you know they're diverse you know

12
00:01:04,31 --> 00:01:08,64
that actually we're all so different
you know and individuality.

13
00:01:08,97 --> 00:01:13,41
And you look at other people you see you
know you think yourselves you think you

14
00:01:13,41 --> 00:01:17,78
know this is actresses reapers
are that furthers really.

15
00:01:17,80 --> 00:01:23,31
So we'll examine trick as a here right
back to the way they are to love.

16
00:01:23,98 --> 00:01:28,79
You know why can't i just bring be
myself in and bring that i speak to me.

17
00:01:30,59 --> 00:01:36,26
And so then sort of you know i suppose
thinking well you know you can you can go

18
00:01:36,26 --> 00:01:41,14
overboard in these things you can sort of
you know sort of guys say oh i'm well.

19
00:01:41,17 --> 00:01:43,14
And i'm gay and i'm a fourth guy you know

20
00:01:43,14 --> 00:01:49,44
and if that's their excess they're out
you know fuck off as you know know.

21
00:01:49,77 --> 00:01:51,24
Without having to do that.

22
00:01:51,52 --> 00:01:53,28
So just interacting with people

23
00:01:53,28 --> 00:01:56,85
and then finding the way you know is he
will find out what you are all about us

24
00:01:58,31 --> 00:02:00,28
either they accept it
or they don't. They do.

25
00:02:00,33 --> 00:02:04,11
Well that's you know that their problem
and they're not worth knowing.

26
00:02:05,47 --> 00:02:07,07
But finding actually finding.

27
00:02:07,53 --> 00:02:12,03
In the 10 years i've been here i've never
had anyone put me down for my sexuality

28
00:02:12,87 --> 00:02:18,00
to my face. That is. And.

29
00:02:18,31 --> 00:02:19,35
I suppose overall

30
00:02:19,35 --> 00:02:23,50
that people just accept me for the way
they put me down for other things

31
00:02:23,50 --> 00:02:25,84
and being the treasurer of all inclusive.

32
00:02:26,15 --> 00:02:29,81
Let's create you know what
you do with our money.

33
00:02:31,01 --> 00:02:34,88
Are you fuckwit.

34
00:02:34,90 --> 00:02:39,30
But not for my sexuality. If anything.

35
00:02:39,32 --> 00:02:42,17
Quite the officers.

36
00:02:42,18 --> 00:02:46,32
That some people really like to
key into that they're like that.

37
00:02:46,46 --> 00:02:51,37
And they like you for your other aspects
you know they're i think people basically

38
00:02:51,37 --> 00:02:57,54
like people who if you. If they
feel comfortable with you.

39
00:02:57,54 --> 00:03:01,64
You know if they feel you're okay
in you not there to hurt and

40
00:03:01,64 --> 00:03:07,70
or do anything you know sort of bad
against them or whatever and also

41
00:03:07,71 --> 00:03:12,79
that you know i think people key into
your energy is this if you if you sort of

42
00:03:12,79 --> 00:03:14,47
stable in yourself if you're.

43
00:03:15,16 --> 00:03:18,92
Contented within yourself that
that shows that that come about.

44
00:03:20,77 --> 00:03:24,00
I think part of that stability
is being honest with yourself

45
00:03:24,00 --> 00:03:27,36
and just expressing yourself
as you are you know.

46
00:03:27,57 --> 00:03:32,51
One enhances the other and that overrides
all those other negative aspects.

47
00:03:34,87 --> 00:03:40,42
And yeah. Finding that people
just accept that. I do find that.

48
00:03:40,43 --> 00:03:44,76
Especially when with the guys
around here the male. There are.

49
00:03:45,08 --> 00:03:50,02
There is sort of probably tolerance in
some people rather than acceptance of.

50
00:03:50,57 --> 00:03:53,61
What it would ever and maybe that.

51
00:03:53,63 --> 00:03:56,64
They'll interact you know
sure you know you do things

52
00:03:56,64 --> 00:04:02,47
but there's a limitation as to
how close you can get. Two.

53
00:04:02,48 --> 00:04:05,86
But there are a lot of guys around who
are don't mind getting close at all.

54
00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:11,02
Into the warrior. Which is great.

55
00:04:13,26 --> 00:04:15,97
Just to give our guys because
you know i think being male

56
00:04:15,97 --> 00:04:22,81
and as i think male liberation is
yet to come is well overdue for

57
00:04:22,81 --> 00:04:23,04
me

58
00:04:23,04 --> 00:04:35,15
and i really need even here
in the old turn a deaf.

59
00:04:36,13 --> 00:04:43,01
Friend. And actually being gay here.

60
00:04:43,85 --> 00:04:44,92
It's not been a problem.

61
00:04:45,24 --> 00:04:50,94
The only thing lately i'm finding is probably
now because i possibly feel a need to

62
00:04:50,94 --> 00:04:56,82
get back into a relationship and for
that to happen when you're in a village

63
00:04:56,82 --> 00:05:00,23
that you know still

64
00:05:00,23 --> 00:05:04,64
that president has very minimal
contact with the outside world.

65
00:05:05,71 --> 00:05:08,34
It's it's a difficult thing to
do i think it's a sort of place

66
00:05:08,34 --> 00:05:12,35
that if you want to settle down there with
a relationship in a relationship here

67
00:05:12,35 --> 00:05:17,42
that you need to find your relationship and
come here rather than finding it here.

68
00:05:19,52 --> 00:05:21,47
Also.

69
00:05:21,49 --> 00:05:22,92
Things expressing

70
00:05:22,92 --> 00:05:26,51
that to a lot of people i found a lot
of people say oh you know like i got a

71
00:05:26,51 --> 00:05:29,15
brother is gay or my son
is gay and stuff like that

72
00:05:29,85 --> 00:05:33,58
that maybe that's not the case.

73
00:05:33,60 --> 00:05:37,64
But anyway.

74
00:05:37,66 --> 00:05:45,39
I mean.

75
00:05:45,41 --> 00:05:50,31
I just know you know i don't think it's
there may have i think at the time.

76
00:05:51,73 --> 00:05:54,78
A number of it here or going
through a sort of change period

77
00:05:54,78 --> 00:05:59,90
and maybe even though this is
a very beautiful place to.

78
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:00,92
These and i mean it's fantastic.

79
00:06:01,38 --> 00:06:05,75
And if you've ever been around the world
over to parts of the world to other

80
00:06:05,75 --> 00:06:07,49
countries you know soon realize that

81
00:06:07,49 --> 00:06:11,92
and we live in utopia
here it is very emplaced.

82
00:06:11,94 --> 00:06:15,79
But also i think the realization that.

83
00:06:15,81 --> 00:06:19,92
Once you are in something for a
period time you take it for granted.

84
00:06:21,85 --> 00:06:24,38
And even though you're in an
environment that's brilliant.

85
00:06:24,65 --> 00:06:29,41
After a while you take it for granted and
you possibly need a change you need.

86
00:06:29,43 --> 00:06:33,65
Blood positive negative things you
know you can't always know or.

87
00:06:34,24 --> 00:06:38,33
Being happy is unless you
experience the offers that.

88
00:06:38,34 --> 00:06:40,18
And so you need a change
you need to get away

89
00:06:40,18 --> 00:06:44,60
and then sometimes you get
overpowered was. Politics.

90
00:06:45,11 --> 00:06:52,99
And even on politics in everything you
can actually help pay for a very.

91
00:06:53,01 --> 00:06:53,72
And

92
00:06:53,72 --> 00:06:58,18
that can sort of make you unhappy say things
like i don't want to say i don't need

93
00:06:58,18 --> 00:07:03,79
this anymore. I want to get out of
here. But i want to do something out.

94
00:07:03,85 --> 00:07:06,72
I need to break away i need
to get different stimulation.

95
00:07:09,30 --> 00:07:11,53
And then through.

96
00:07:11,54 --> 00:07:13,65
I don't know whether it's circumstances

97
00:07:13,65 --> 00:07:20,10
that i think i actually say we created
even if we don't realize that doing.

98
00:07:20,12 --> 00:07:22,67
A radio cause in radio programming

99
00:07:22,67 --> 00:07:30,10
and from.

100
00:07:30,11 --> 00:07:31,64
The that's right.

101
00:07:31,72 --> 00:07:32,99
I got involved after

102
00:07:32,99 --> 00:07:36,37
that stage of sort of you know
sort of a bit of a change going on

103
00:07:36,37 --> 00:07:42,16
and i started i got involved with doing
a course in radio programming and

104
00:07:42,17 --> 00:07:44,76
that was through taif and
was more and part of

105
00:07:44,76 --> 00:07:51,58
that was actually doing experience at the.
Ensign are. F.m. So a community radio.

106
00:07:52,89 --> 00:07:57,20
Which was then at the college
the northern rivers college at

107
00:07:57,20 --> 00:07:59,79
that particular time and during that.

108
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,52
Because we're talking with the
program manager at the station

109
00:08:05,52 --> 00:08:07,24
and she asked me what sort of program.

110
00:08:07,54 --> 00:08:09,00
I was looking at doing and

111
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:14,67
and i at the time i thought well i suppose
if i want to do a program be something

112
00:08:14,67 --> 00:08:19,07
you do is something a bit radical
or gay people or something like

113
00:08:19,07 --> 00:08:22,30
that gay program.

114
00:08:22,32 --> 00:08:23,86
And then sometime after

115
00:08:23,86 --> 00:08:28,43
that she then approached me about actually
doing the program there was a gay

116
00:08:28,43 --> 00:08:33,32
program called gay ways gay and
lesbian program i should say so.

117
00:08:35,35 --> 00:08:38,61
Called gay ways. And.

118
00:08:38,63 --> 00:08:44,15
She asked me if if i get involved
with that program and i thought about

119
00:08:44,15 --> 00:08:45,30
and i thought i ok.

120
00:08:45,95 --> 00:08:50,74
And sort of circumstance at the time
sort of created that too i suppose.

121
00:08:52,12 --> 00:08:54,86
Sort of coming back from
sydney and getting stuck

122
00:08:54,86 --> 00:08:57,32
and losing all because we had
a flight on a particular time

123
00:08:57,32 --> 00:09:02,01
and staying at the radio station to
help them case out the muti equipment

124
00:09:03,15 --> 00:09:07,53
and then finding us doing on air
programming for the first time and then

125
00:09:08,41 --> 00:09:12,90
when i started getting involved
with the actual gateways program.

126
00:09:12,92 --> 00:09:16,88
And at that particular
time sort of finding

127
00:09:16,88 --> 00:09:22,20
that it really need to be restructured to
create a better program for homosexual

128
00:09:22,20 --> 00:09:28,52
people. And approaching a friend and
asking her if she could get involved

129
00:09:28,52 --> 00:09:34,15
and she agreed and through
that involvement and.

130
00:09:35,29 --> 00:09:37,08
She was actually the one that expressed

131
00:09:37,08 --> 00:09:40,72
that she'd like to have gay dancers around
the area because there really wasn't any

132
00:09:40,72 --> 00:09:45,67
way with that homosexual
people would go to to meet.

133
00:09:45,68 --> 00:09:47,82
And so i created.

134
00:09:47,84 --> 00:09:52,06
And then the realisation then that we needed
a group of people to set the dance up.

135
00:09:52,97 --> 00:09:56,13
So then came the idea of
we need a gay group here

136
00:09:57,43 --> 00:10:01,36
and even though there had
been various. Groups and.

137
00:10:02,13 --> 00:10:05,90
So to come and gone and i think along
with the northern rivers gay group

138
00:10:05,90 --> 00:10:09,76
and the other was some
land some langauge group

139
00:10:11,80 --> 00:10:14,13
that they really didn't last
long and sort of died out.

140
00:10:15,76 --> 00:10:19,48
So we then went about
trying to form a group

141
00:10:21,40 --> 00:10:24,91
that was a lot of work for you know a lot
of running around a lot of structuring

142
00:10:24,91 --> 00:10:30,49
but very positive stuff with getting i was
finding actually i was getting back a

143
00:10:30,49 --> 00:10:36,08
lot of very positive feedback
and. They quite intrigued me.

144
00:10:37,17 --> 00:10:38,90
Because also.

145
00:10:39,61 --> 00:10:42,79
Some people had expressed
that wouldn't happen

146
00:10:42,79 --> 00:10:45,45
that there's too much
homophobia around still

147
00:10:45,45 --> 00:10:50,46
and especially in lismore in particular
newspaper and leaves more at

148
00:10:50,46 --> 00:10:54,74
that particular time was very
anti-gay with their article

149
00:10:56,17 --> 00:11:00,25
but not really keying into
that i couldn't really see

150
00:11:00,25 --> 00:11:03,33
that i suppose because of being a bill

151
00:11:03,33 --> 00:11:06,75
and with sort of tend to be
somewhat isolated from the.

152
00:11:07,51 --> 00:11:11,09
You can get so locked up in
the place where you're living

153
00:11:11,09 --> 00:11:13,35
that you know every day and
then you realize oh wow.

154
00:11:13,37 --> 00:11:17,90
There's a system out there there's a whole
new world out there. So not really.

155
00:11:19,08 --> 00:11:21,44
I suppose being keyed into
it's happening in the area.

156
00:11:21,85 --> 00:11:27,03
And i think that's probably a
good thing. So we went ahead and.

157
00:11:27,05 --> 00:11:30,93
The first dance we had actually
the majority of people

158
00:11:30,93 --> 00:11:36,80
that helped us set up the dance were
heterosexual friends who was intriguing

159
00:11:36,80 --> 00:11:39,07
but the dance was a success.

160
00:11:39,19 --> 00:11:42,79
I think we had about one hundred twenty
hundred thirty paying people going in

161
00:11:43,91 --> 00:11:46,96
and then it started from there.

162
00:11:48,90 --> 00:11:51,62
And jesus would have been.

163
00:11:51,64 --> 00:11:53,87
At three

164
00:11:53,88 --> 00:11:59,73
and probably four years ago
now it's a year before.

165
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,96
Years ago. Yeah as a group well
at the time. And see it was.

166
00:12:06,04 --> 00:12:11,59
We use the name of some langauge group
and then it was until about a third

167
00:12:11,59 --> 00:12:13,75
or fourth meeting.

168
00:12:14,90 --> 00:12:21,02
That we decided on a name which
was the tropical fruits. And.

169
00:12:21,04 --> 00:12:23,91
Even for the first i think. Probably.

170
00:12:26,29 --> 00:12:31,28
Seven eight nine meetings we had that
only a handful of us at the meeting.

171
00:12:31,51 --> 00:12:34,14
And the second day and we
put on we had problems.

172
00:12:35,17 --> 00:12:39,76
We actually experience i think
what was a bit of homophobia.

173
00:12:39,77 --> 00:12:42,31
Were told that particular
hole we were using

174
00:12:42,31 --> 00:12:48,26
and a last minute we couldn't use
because the wiring was condemned.

175
00:12:48,28 --> 00:12:50,34
Only a day before the dance was on.

176
00:12:50,60 --> 00:12:56,79
So we had to buy find another ball
quickly which we did quite fortunately.

177
00:12:56,81 --> 00:12:59,63
And then fine.

178
00:12:59,65 --> 00:13:05,76
People just set up to redirect people
to turn a new hole and in spite of all.

179
00:13:06,16 --> 00:13:11,47
That was our second dance we had it
went off really well. Was a great day.

180
00:13:13,11 --> 00:13:14,39
And.

181
00:13:15,80 --> 00:13:19,00
Then i think we had a bit of a lull
in the group at that particular time

182
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:21,51
and i was signing by then.

183
00:13:22,78 --> 00:13:27,69
That i was doing the gateways
program and then we had this group

184
00:13:27,69 --> 00:13:32,85
and was started putting out a newsletter
as well so doing quite a quite a lot of

185
00:13:32,85 --> 00:13:37,19
different things. And.

186
00:13:37,21 --> 00:13:43,35
Also at that particular time i got
involved a relationship that.

187
00:13:43,37 --> 00:13:45,18
Turned out to be quite present.

188
00:13:46,51 --> 00:13:49,06
I think that was taking more
remote time that it is our go out

189
00:13:50,41 --> 00:13:52,63
and so i tend to let go the group a bit

190
00:13:53,51 --> 00:13:56,47
but unfortunately there were other people
there to take over to get involved

191
00:13:56,47 --> 00:13:59,71
and that's when i think it
really started taking off.

192
00:14:01,10 --> 00:14:04,57
Which i suppose showed me that i
think you can take us things so far

193
00:14:04,57 --> 00:14:06,23
and then you've got to let it go.

194
00:14:06,26 --> 00:14:10,49
And if if it's if it's
meant to happen it will go

195
00:14:10,49 --> 00:14:16,51
and if not it doesn't much work.

196
00:14:17,27 --> 00:14:22,56
So there was well there is virtually
no one at that particular time then

197
00:14:23,50 --> 00:14:29,46
and only for the gateways program
was going and then used to wonder.

198
00:14:30,74 --> 00:14:34,20
As to you know who was if there was anyone
listening to the program because it was

199
00:14:34,20 --> 00:14:37,60
fairly late at night so.

200
00:14:38,26 --> 00:14:44,66
A lot of people deal strict as to listening
to to the program because of the

201
00:14:44,66 --> 00:14:49,94
time slot and then we had problems
that used to be an earlier time slot

202
00:14:49,94 --> 00:14:52,01
that got moved and we
couldn't get it changed back

203
00:14:53,37 --> 00:14:57,20
and we wondered whether part of that might
have been from fear homophobia again.

204
00:14:58,72 --> 00:15:02,24
But apart from that there was there
was no other no network there.

205
00:15:02,39 --> 00:15:04,67
There's an overall net gain a twerk.

206
00:15:04,69 --> 00:15:09,64
Cause i think country network
covers the whole of australia

207
00:15:09,64 --> 00:15:12,48
and i think there were quite
a few people gay people.

208
00:15:13,75 --> 00:15:19,33
Sexual people from this area who
are members of that network.

209
00:15:21,24 --> 00:15:23,96
But apart from that there
was nothing else here.

210
00:15:24,14 --> 00:15:29,76
Then with the group with we had a
magazine which we called through tuesday

211
00:15:31,28 --> 00:15:36,42
and. We may we used to
print that every month.

212
00:15:38,06 --> 00:15:42,77
And then we started linking up with
with other gay groups and other areas

213
00:15:42,77 --> 00:15:45,93
and through the gay media
and the gay press.

214
00:15:47,44 --> 00:15:48,92
We were advertising ourselves

215
00:15:50,30 --> 00:15:54,87
and cause now i think we're
you have a reputation or

216
00:15:54,87 --> 00:15:59,73
that particular think the gay crew the
tropical fruit has a reputation of being the

217
00:15:59,73 --> 00:16:02,24
most. They've all the country network

218
00:16:05,33 --> 00:16:07,74
and.

219
00:16:07,76 --> 00:16:13,56
The dancers who i suppose you get anything
up to three hundred people at a dance

220
00:16:13,56 --> 00:16:19,74
which is quite a lot and. The reputation
for the dancers has seen to be very cool.

221
00:16:20,98 --> 00:16:27,62
Explorer. Just getting back to
the the network around the area.

222
00:16:28,06 --> 00:16:32,39
A lot of things seem to happen at the
same time with doing the radio program

223
00:16:32,39 --> 00:16:36,82
and then the the group in the
newsletter and and the dancers

224
00:16:36,82 --> 00:16:44,13
and there are also got involved
with looking at setting up.

225
00:16:44,88 --> 00:16:50,94
The. A network for people
for hiv positive people.

226
00:16:52,43 --> 00:16:55,63
That there were a group of people
in lismore that were interested

227
00:16:55,63 --> 00:16:59,59
and having meetings and a
particular time to having meetings

228
00:16:59,59 --> 00:17:05,47
that some vincent's hospital. To set up a.

229
00:17:06,51 --> 00:17:08,70
An organ. So i was right. A.

230
00:17:10,49 --> 00:17:16,32
Support group for people who are
hiv positive for our aids people.

231
00:17:16,34 --> 00:17:19,11
And i thought i was
involved with that too.

232
00:17:21,21 --> 00:17:25,37
To a minimal degree mainly because the my
link with the group was a social group

233
00:17:25,37 --> 00:17:27,03
and the radio program.

234
00:17:28,14 --> 00:17:33,32
And what actually happened was
a con was approached in sydney

235
00:17:33,32 --> 00:17:37,71
and they had a person come out to
look at setting up a branch up here

236
00:17:38,51 --> 00:17:42,74
and that's what eventually happens
then we had the aiken branch

237
00:17:42,74 --> 00:17:48,05
and youth our part of the northern
rivers area. The northern district.

238
00:17:48,83 --> 00:17:51,15
Not exactly sean that dates but probably

239
00:17:51,15 --> 00:17:56,27
that would have been a village over
three years ago about three years ago

240
00:17:56,27 --> 00:18:01,50
that. And. With fairly
well established here.

241
00:18:03,62 --> 00:18:05,70
I think they do a lot of
good work around the area

242
00:18:05,70 --> 00:18:08,17
that also there was a
needle exchange program but

243
00:18:08,17 --> 00:18:15,45
that was actually set up by the health
department i think before a con.

244
00:18:16,71 --> 00:18:20,98
And then. I think a kind also
had sort of given a lot.

245
00:18:21,82 --> 00:18:28,08
I helped sort of set up a networking
system as well and i sort of.

246
00:18:28,09 --> 00:18:32,48
Supported by the the tropical
fruits and vice versa.

247
00:18:33,67 --> 00:18:33,97
Even though

248
00:18:33,97 --> 00:18:38,55
that the tropical fruit was actually just
a social group right from the beginning

249
00:18:38,55 --> 00:18:42,73
it was expressed that it should just be
purely for enjoyment and entertainment

250
00:18:42,73 --> 00:18:45,35
and shouldn't be political. In any way.

251
00:18:46,90 --> 00:18:52,68
Though it's always hard to bring colour
ticks into any say they were there was used

252
00:18:52,68 --> 00:18:57,24
to have a we have dance with actually a lot
of the dancers were at repentance creek

253
00:18:57,24 --> 00:19:00,46
all. And then there was
for a little while.

254
00:19:01,61 --> 00:19:04,74
We had no problems with that until they
had a change in the whole committee

255
00:19:05,79 --> 00:19:06,90
and the new committee decided

256
00:19:06,90 --> 00:19:12,28
that then it would have proved
as having dances there but.

257
00:19:13,14 --> 00:19:19,57
That led ended up in a consultation
at one of the meetings. And.

258
00:19:20,21 --> 00:19:26,43
Other on forgotten i'm pretty during
the 13 up of of the gay group

259
00:19:26,43 --> 00:19:33,17
and the social group on the radio program
and the newsletter the magazine.

260
00:19:34,43 --> 00:19:35,91
We also were approached by

261
00:19:36,62 --> 00:19:41,63
and i think it was fred miller at the
time who was one who's involved with the

262
00:19:41,63 --> 00:19:46,21
police gailey a zone group and.

263
00:19:46,22 --> 00:19:48,99
So he came up from sydney and
we had meetings with him

264
00:19:48,99 --> 00:19:51,94
and one of the local pubs in lou's well

265
00:19:51,94 --> 00:19:58,63
and also the local community
police officer and.

266
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,16
Right. Notion it at all.

267
00:20:08,36 --> 00:20:10,05
Anyway we had meetings in.

268
00:20:10,75 --> 00:20:16,60
One of the social venues in lismore and.

269
00:20:16,62 --> 00:20:19,04
Formed also form the police

270
00:20:19,04 --> 00:20:24,25
and gay liaison group for this area.

271
00:20:24,26 --> 00:20:31,13
And also at the time there
were some people who who felt

272
00:20:31,13 --> 00:20:34,76
that we should have some
radical gay group here.

273
00:20:34,77 --> 00:20:38,46
Gay activists and maybe
a branch of act up.

274
00:20:39,52 --> 00:20:44,53
Should be represented here and i
sort of got involved with that also

275
00:20:44,53 --> 00:20:49,56
and so we had to make sure that we that
we didn't involve the social group with

276
00:20:49,56 --> 00:20:53,79
that and there were there was a
time when fred nile came up here

277
00:20:53,79 --> 00:21:01,74
and we we had a bit of a demonstration
at brunswick heads which was televised.

278
00:21:01,75 --> 00:21:04,18
To coincidence.

279
00:21:05,41 --> 00:21:10,15
But what was more interesting was the
reaction from people i walking down the

280
00:21:10,15 --> 00:21:12,65
street people would come up to
me that i never seen before

281
00:21:12,65 --> 00:21:19,27
and i say i saw you on t.v. and I think
they are it's great. I think it's good i.

282
00:21:19,42 --> 00:21:22,55
I like what you're doing. I'm like i
really support you know stuff like that.

283
00:21:22,70 --> 00:21:27,49
So it's very positive stuff
i've got a bit of a blow out.

284
00:21:27,51 --> 00:21:33,92
That that was happening. Right.

285
00:21:35,49 --> 00:21:36,31
Yes there is

286
00:21:37,06 --> 00:21:42,17
and there is so in little more too
apparently other unaware of it until fairly

287
00:21:42,17 --> 00:21:47,26
until after i actually got involved with
was helping set up the gay group the

288
00:21:47,26 --> 00:21:54,07
social gay group that i
discovered there was.

289
00:21:55,29 --> 00:21:59,92
But apart from all that they had
there were little thing with light.

290
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,27
Again i think in some of the local papers
like the northern star in the ekka.

291
00:22:05,29 --> 00:22:07,42
There are articles by people who felt

292
00:22:07,42 --> 00:22:12,50
that you know having radical posters running
around the hills is not a good thing

293
00:22:13,75 --> 00:22:16,91
and that they they found
that they didn't like so.

294
00:22:18,27 --> 00:22:19,43
And of course there's something like

295
00:22:19,43 --> 00:22:23,37
that would happen with you know little
are always be a few of us heard write

296
00:22:23,37 --> 00:22:29,46
articles in reply to that and
explain that you know we're human.

297
00:22:29,46 --> 00:22:33,79
We're people too and you know we
just might turn to be a selves and

298
00:22:35,25 --> 00:22:36,50
that we're not really hurting anyone.

299
00:22:37,90 --> 00:22:44,24
And why should it worry then what we do.

300
00:22:44,25 --> 00:22:55,54
You know.

301
00:22:55,56 --> 00:23:00,43
You know i do have a few like i think them
very any of the president a funny story

302
00:23:00,43 --> 00:23:02,23
about kids.
