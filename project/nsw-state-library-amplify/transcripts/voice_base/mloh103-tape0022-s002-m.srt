1
00:00:11,50 --> 00:00:17,83
Yes.

2
00:00:19,22 --> 00:00:24,00
Much lies yet you know. And.

3
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:30,86
Yeah. One would have hoped that.

4
00:00:32,21 --> 00:00:38,45
Folks settling in this community would have
been enormously industrious to build a

5
00:00:38,46 --> 00:00:42,77
low impact low demand sustainable lifestyle
planting permaculture across the

6
00:00:42,77 --> 00:00:47,24
hillsides. Vegetable gardens
in the rich volcanic soil.

7
00:00:49,10 --> 00:00:55,04
Learning skills to support
themselves economically.

8
00:00:58,10 --> 00:01:00,60
I've not done any
scientific analysis of this

9
00:01:00,60 --> 00:01:05,04
but it seems to me a third of the people
would make very little if any effort in

10
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:11,30
those directions at all and other third
makes. And other thirds quite industrious.

11
00:01:14,37 --> 00:01:17,20
I say one would have hoped
because there's a crying need.

12
00:01:17,85 --> 00:01:22,89
Across the planet for a low impact
low demand sustainable lifestyle.

13
00:01:23,74 --> 00:01:26,91
To rein in the horrendous excesses

14
00:01:26,91 --> 00:01:34,67
and waste of rampant consumerism
in the materialistic west.

15
00:01:34,68 --> 00:01:40,63
That also to show a viable way
of fulfilling life to the

16
00:01:41,49 --> 00:01:44,69
impoverished third world.

17
00:01:47,51 --> 00:01:53,03
The sort of alternative society
which exists in pockets in

18
00:01:53,03 --> 00:01:59,92
and around rainbow region. Does
bear these characteristics it does.

19
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,70
Show. A fireball future direction
for planetary civilization.

20
00:02:06,74 --> 00:02:06,85
But

21
00:02:06,86 --> 00:02:14,08
that matter first station has
been severely damaged by.

22
00:02:15,95 --> 00:02:17,92
The one third who contribute nothing

23
00:02:17,92 --> 00:02:24,24
and the 130 contribute only a little.

24
00:02:27,91 --> 00:02:34,49
And.

25
00:02:37,56 --> 00:02:42,21
Well as a lawyer i was not able to
practice without fear of employment

26
00:02:42,21 --> 00:02:48,57
and was unable to gain employment locally
because of resentment from a very

27
00:02:48,57 --> 00:02:49,75
conservative profession.

28
00:02:50,43 --> 00:02:56,58
So i had to go to the gold coast to get
a job and polish up my skills again.

29
00:02:57,93 --> 00:03:02,48
I have done that and and could move
back now set up my own practice.

30
00:03:03,15 --> 00:03:05,86
But lacked the capital to really do so

31
00:03:05,86 --> 00:03:09,50
and was so much children are going
to school on the gold coast now.

32
00:03:11,09 --> 00:03:15,21
It's a lot of good things down here which
are very attractive living close to the

33
00:03:15,21 --> 00:03:16,78
mountains growing one's own food.

34
00:03:18,14 --> 00:03:24,86
The various aspects of alternative culture
which are so positive like home birthing.

35
00:03:24,88 --> 00:03:28,97
The bush music scene. Alternative power.

36
00:03:30,31 --> 00:03:35,68
Alternative healing.

37
00:03:35,70 --> 00:03:37,93
It's a for it's a fine culture to live in

38
00:03:37,93 --> 00:03:43,03
and develop a love harking
back to what i saying earlier.

39
00:03:43,05 --> 00:03:47,03
I think that easy welfare. And.

40
00:03:47,04 --> 00:03:51,97
The tractions of black market
marijuana growing and dealing.

41
00:03:52,97 --> 00:03:58,49
Which has had a spin off with
considerable portion of of heroin users

42
00:03:58,49 --> 00:04:03,31
and white powder. Been a
fetter mean type users.

43
00:04:05,21 --> 00:04:06,16
Of the downside of

44
00:04:06,16 --> 00:04:12,39
that positive culture of course those
downsides exist throughout society there have

45
00:04:12,39 --> 00:04:13,63
been limited to this one.

46
00:04:16,69 --> 00:04:20,97
That the shame of it is
the enormous national

47
00:04:20,98 --> 00:04:24,24
and planetary need for this sort of.

48
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:31,67
Low impact low demand lifestyle to be
evidence in a thoroughly positive way.

49
00:04:31,69 --> 00:04:35,04
And one would have hoped after 20 years
a lot more would have been achieved

50
00:04:35,04 --> 00:04:49,58
and has been.

51
00:04:49,60 --> 00:04:56,51
I found it at the time rather.
Airy fairy and hedonistic.

52
00:04:57,86 --> 00:05:03,41
But i hope that people would be able
to implement that idealism into nuts

53
00:05:03,41 --> 00:05:08,90
and bolts reality of homes and orchards
and local industries and craft.

54
00:05:13,45 --> 00:05:19,29
For the first five or ten
years. Folk would say.

55
00:05:20,03 --> 00:05:23,74
Oh where shell shocked from being in the
world outside we need to turn inwards

56
00:05:23,74 --> 00:05:27,00
and observe nature and get some sort
of centering on what we're going to do

57
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:33,28
and why and i kept saying that for another
five years. I think after 20 years.

58
00:05:34,83 --> 00:05:40,16
With really got to bridge the gap
between the intellectual ideals

59
00:05:41,08 --> 00:05:43,61
and the nuts and bolts physical reality.

60
00:05:44,25 --> 00:05:49,72
In australia which is going
down the chute economically.

61
00:05:51,03 --> 00:05:58,83
That's not good enough to keep putting
one's hand out to the public purse.

62
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:01,30
No doubt there's a.

63
00:06:01,84 --> 00:06:07,48
Horrific rich poor gap in australia
which justifies the economically

64
00:06:07,49 --> 00:06:11,67
underprivileged sections
receiving some welfare

65
00:06:13,90 --> 00:06:15,44
and no doubt the receipt of

66
00:06:15,44 --> 00:06:18,47
that welfare relieves
revolutionary type pressure on

67
00:06:19,16 --> 00:06:23,61
that 10 per cent which controls
90 per cent of the wealth.

68
00:06:26,01 --> 00:06:30,37
Welfare as a good and just thing in
the present economic arrangement.

69
00:06:31,34 --> 00:06:37,18
But once criticism must go to the
present political economic arrangement.

70
00:06:38,62 --> 00:06:41,44
It's preserving this rich poor gap.

71
00:06:41,45 --> 00:06:48,42
It's preserving enormous waste of
energy in government and bureaucracy.

72
00:06:49,52 --> 00:06:50,06
It's my thesis

73
00:06:50,06 --> 00:06:57,68
that by adopting a more
decentralized system

74
00:06:58,45 --> 00:07:05,42
with. Political power maximized in local
areas. And economic independence.

75
00:07:05,44 --> 00:07:10,47
Maximise as much as possible in the local
areas so as to obviate the need for

76
00:07:10,47 --> 00:07:17,65
transportation.

77
00:07:17,67 --> 00:07:22,36
So a lot of this wastage of
money on central government

78
00:07:23,27 --> 00:07:29,62
and the

79
00:07:30,69 --> 00:07:33,51
concentration of wealth in a
few hands can be avoided.

80
00:07:33,91 --> 00:07:41,25
There's a sink simple one simple answer to
australia's economic political imbalance.

81
00:07:41,27 --> 00:07:43,43
And that is to replace all taxation.

82
00:07:43,95 --> 00:07:50,28
With site revenue site revenue should
be a sole source of public finance

83
00:07:51,57 --> 00:07:55,49
site revenue is a collection of the only
all mental value of sites privately

84
00:07:55,49 --> 00:08:00,12
occupied whether those sites
be on land and water or. Yeah.

85
00:08:01,92 --> 00:08:07,40
Whether those sites be used for
residence commercial industrial public

86
00:08:07,41 --> 00:08:13,60
or any other use. The only sites which
should be free of paying site revenue.

87
00:08:14,17 --> 00:08:16,11
Would be there

88
00:08:16,12 --> 00:08:21,21
and which is truly open to the
public at any time such as roads.

89
00:08:21,78 --> 00:08:24,39
National parks beaches.

90
00:08:27,01 --> 00:08:32,19
Land which is held by government
bodies such as ministries

91
00:08:32,19 --> 00:08:35,59
or local government including church land.

92
00:08:36,14 --> 00:08:37,00
All of

93
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:41,17
that should pay the annual rental value
of the site occupied to the community.

94
00:08:42,18 --> 00:08:45,71
This would force down
the price of land such

95
00:08:45,71 --> 00:08:50,56
that land would eventually transfer only
for the value of improvements upon it

96
00:08:52,06 --> 00:08:56,09
would be a severe disincentive to people
owning more land than they have to.

97
00:08:57,27 --> 00:09:02,77
Would make a lot of land available for
the present unemployed folks to settle

98
00:09:02,77 --> 00:09:07,96
and pioneer survivor lifestyles
like their forefathers did.

99
00:09:09,39 --> 00:09:16,22
Because workers would have this choice of
independence on their own. Smallholding.

100
00:09:17,22 --> 00:09:20,24
So there'd be competition for labor

101
00:09:21,24 --> 00:09:24,69
and rewards for labor would
naturally be high without the.

102
00:09:27,78 --> 00:09:34,92
Necessity for union action.

103
00:09:34,93 --> 00:09:38,40
No longer would there be the
massive imposts upon effort

104
00:09:38,40 --> 00:09:43,53
and creativity which income tax
paid roll tax stamp duties.

105
00:09:45,99 --> 00:09:52,93
Financial institution taxes and horror
of horrors the proposed g s.t..

106
00:09:54,77 --> 00:09:59,43
Embroil any industrious
person in suffering.

107
00:10:10,60 --> 00:10:16,92
That's a simple solution
site revenue. Rate.

108
00:10:18,75 --> 00:10:24,59
And. I think.

109
00:10:24,60 --> 00:10:28,71
There has been good advances
on various cultural fronts.

110
00:10:29,67 --> 00:10:33,03
Such as community based pre-school
ing and primary schooling.

111
00:10:33,71 --> 00:10:37,46
Home birthing bush music.

112
00:10:37,48 --> 00:10:42,74
Alternative power.

113
00:10:42,75 --> 00:10:46,64
There are good examples of permaculture.

114
00:10:47,77 --> 00:10:51,17
And so subsistence.

115
00:10:51,19 --> 00:10:58,10
I'd say it's gone a decent way down the
track in evidencing what's possible.

116
00:10:58,87 --> 00:11:04,98
Although to me personally the progress
has been sadly inadequate for where we

117
00:11:04,98 --> 00:11:09,11
should and could have been
at this time. You know.

118
00:11:09,53 --> 00:11:14,14
Reality is not in the way
or. I just shooting for.

119
00:11:15,26 --> 00:11:19,19
Oh.

120
00:11:23,30 --> 00:11:26,11
Yes it could it could it
could be the hard knocks.

121
00:11:26,17 --> 00:11:30,90
Is this really it is difficult to
struggle with inadequate capital to build

122
00:11:30,90 --> 00:11:34,12
and plant.

123
00:11:36,44 --> 00:11:40,40
It's. So easy to get any.

124
00:11:41,08 --> 00:11:47,74
Caught up in in the effort of day
to day living family tensions.

125
00:11:48,91 --> 00:11:54,55
The sheer problems of living hard in an
area like this with without often without

126
00:11:54,55 --> 00:11:59,07
electricity and with heavy rainfall.

127
00:12:02,88 --> 00:12:05,07
And many people can't afford.

128
00:12:05,09 --> 00:12:11,04
The basic price of a share in land which
is usually gone far beyond the original

129
00:12:11,04 --> 00:12:15,85
$200 which total loss telling totals
now about twelve or fifteen hundred.

130
00:12:15,87 --> 00:12:21,37
With difficult conditions
of. Approval to me.

131
00:12:21,39 --> 00:12:26,10
Met before any shares granted.

132
00:12:27,03 --> 00:12:29,18
Really they could and
should have been dozens

133
00:12:29,18 --> 00:12:34,18
or scores of large scale community
settlements like tata bull.

134
00:12:34,81 --> 00:12:37,54
That the high price of land
has made that difficult.

135
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:42,74
There was one effort several years
ago tiam akari on the kayak

136
00:12:42,74 --> 00:12:48,96
or road where the new south wales.
Department of i think it was housing.

137
00:12:49,99 --> 00:12:54,56
Assisted in setting up a low
impact low demand type. Community.

138
00:12:56,00 --> 00:12:59,67
With with subsidised.

139
00:12:59,68 --> 00:13:04,02
Share prices which could be paid back
over a period even by someone receiving

140
00:13:04,02 --> 00:13:06,13
welfare. Unfortunately

141
00:13:06,14 --> 00:13:12,57
that whole exercise was severely damaged
by one element of settlers who wanted to

142
00:13:12,57 --> 00:13:15,99
grow marijuana which was obviously
contrary to the mandate

143
00:13:15,99 --> 00:13:21,93
or franchise a state government had
entrusted to those steering the community.

144
00:13:23,35 --> 00:13:24,36
And then if a change of government

145
00:13:24,36 --> 00:13:30,83
and the new south wales liberals
quickly ended the adventure.

146
00:13:30,85 --> 00:13:34,28
But to answer your question.

147
00:13:34,30 --> 00:13:41,42
There's a lot of physical difficulties
in fulfilling the ideals.

148
00:13:41,43 --> 00:13:46,61
That in a world which is suffering such
threats to its continued existence from

149
00:13:46,62 --> 00:13:52,94
pollution poverty unemployment
economic illness.

150
00:13:56,47 --> 00:14:00,26
It's incumbent upon every one of us
to keep those ideals in me. Find.

151
00:14:00,79 --> 00:14:02,12
To our best to achieve it

152
00:14:02,84 --> 00:14:08,38
and not cut down as being
abnormally tall poppies.

153
00:14:08,40 --> 00:14:14,38
Other individuals who.

154
00:14:15,37 --> 00:14:19,68
Exhort folk to aim at those ideals

155
00:14:21,11 --> 00:14:23,99
and even.

156
00:14:25,87 --> 00:14:31,29
Exhort them to cease wasting the
potentials we have such crying planetary

157
00:14:31,29 --> 00:14:43,05
and national need to achieve those ideals.

158
00:14:44,64 --> 00:14:47,08
Well i think my favorite memory
happens every dawn and dusk

159
00:14:47,77 --> 00:14:50,56
when the stillness
descends on this valley.

160
00:14:50,58 --> 00:14:55,69
And the birds and all their
incredible variety and richness.

161
00:14:57,76 --> 00:14:59,80
Call their their clear sounds back

162
00:14:59,80 --> 00:15:06,22
and forth.

163
00:15:07,82 --> 00:15:13,61
Something. Yes definitely.

164
00:15:14,99 --> 00:15:20,20
The mandala mountain around mount warning

165
00:15:21,86 --> 00:15:24,83
attracted me here to settle.

166
00:15:26,14 --> 00:15:26,65
You may be aware

167
00:15:26,65 --> 00:15:31,99
that the amount warnings the highest
mountain in eastern australia.

168
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:35,24
Receives the first sunlight of
a dawn touching this continent

169
00:15:36,35 --> 00:15:39,40
and it's a plug of an ancient volcano.

170
00:15:40,28 --> 00:15:41,34
The rim of that ultra

171
00:15:41,34 --> 00:15:47,06
and volcano is the nightcap range here in
the south where tuttle is the tweed range

172
00:15:47,06 --> 00:15:50,67
in the west and the macpherson
range along the queensland border.

173
00:15:50,69 --> 00:15:57,55
So if you look at it on a broad scale contour
map you're see a veritable circle of

174
00:15:57,55 --> 00:16:00,18
mountains. Centred on mount. Morning.

175
00:16:03,39 --> 00:16:05,70
So if it for 20 years.

176
00:16:05,71 --> 00:16:09,97
I saw this is actually a mandala
terrain of a cross which and you

177
00:16:09,97 --> 00:16:14,84
and civilization could be
built. And demonstrating.

178
00:16:14,86 --> 00:16:21,05
A valuable way of life for
the rest of the nation

179
00:16:21,05 --> 00:16:27,58
and the globe can expand on that and.

180
00:16:27,59 --> 00:16:49,01
Chris i think i mean.

181
00:16:49,02 --> 00:16:52,08
There is an infinite consciousness.

182
00:16:53,98 --> 00:16:55,36
Some might call it god

183
00:16:55,36 --> 00:17:01,47
or buddha.

184
00:17:01,49 --> 00:17:07,63
I think jesus christ was a true
individual who. Free thoroughly.

185
00:17:07,81 --> 00:17:10,82
Into the highest extent embodied that.

186
00:17:11,57 --> 00:17:20,67
Consciousness.

187
00:17:23,26 --> 00:17:32,53
Is not something one can
intellectualize very well.

188
00:17:32,54 --> 00:17:35,97
That living close to nature.
Growing one's own food.

189
00:17:38,27 --> 00:17:41,91
You know i've been happy and
felt at peace with the universe.

190
00:17:43,36 --> 00:17:46,61
And that's all the spiritual
insight i require.

191
00:17:48,29 --> 00:17:48,62
And things

192
00:17:48,62 --> 00:17:55,85
that.

193
00:17:55,87 --> 00:17:59,77
I can take on the 6th of december 1990.

194
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,46
No kind of.

195
00:18:06,49 --> 00:18:08,99
Health care like.

196
00:18:09,00 --> 00:18:17,51
Someone told me it's some
indonesian for sewa.

197
00:18:17,52 --> 00:18:21,84
Straight. But.

198
00:18:21,85 --> 00:18:28,75
A camera and soft technology engineers
pictures and carly mclachlan and.

199
00:18:28,77 --> 00:18:30,84
I'm very busy working for
rainbow power at the moment

200
00:18:30,84 --> 00:18:35,65
but i still live in this community as i've
done for 19 years now. That adjustors.

201
00:18:35,67 --> 00:18:39,96
And i first came to nimbin
for the queerest festival

202
00:18:41,08 --> 00:18:44,60
when i came up with a wonderful
contingent of 10 hippies for minute knee

203
00:18:45,38 --> 00:18:47,29
and we brought with us
a prefab recanted dome

204
00:18:48,10 --> 00:18:50,13
and put it up on the
paddock the side of nimbin

205
00:18:50,13 --> 00:18:52,84
and we had an unbelievably
amazing two weeks.

206
00:18:52,92 --> 00:18:58,81
It was self like a dry run for what could
be possible in the way of soft technology.

207
00:18:58,83 --> 00:19:04,15
And it worked nicely. With a
wonderful time and the. The bamboo.

208
00:19:05,67 --> 00:19:08,15
Jam tin and plastic dome
which is quite big.

209
00:19:08,31 --> 00:19:10,49
We eventually sacked totally

210
00:19:10,49 --> 00:19:13,47
and with thatching on it made a
perfectly respectable building.

211
00:19:13,60 --> 00:19:17,27
We had a fireplace in the
middle and that's all around it

212
00:19:17,27 --> 00:19:22,54
and it was a bit like a tepee you know back
buckminster fully tepee was a concept.

213
00:19:24,55 --> 00:19:26,19
What i consider getting around it.

214
00:19:27,51 --> 00:19:32,51
Music was a bit of a broke
revival thing starting.

215
00:19:32,53 --> 00:19:37,87
And also the celtic revival and there's
a great spirit of ancient momentum

216
00:19:38,94 --> 00:19:39,99
that was happening at that stage

217
00:19:39,99 --> 00:19:45,04
and we had in anderson from the
doors playing bach. Minuets.

218
00:19:45,56 --> 00:19:48,27
Interspersed with rock music
it was i guess you'd call it.

219
00:19:48,73 --> 00:19:53,94
Broken celtic infusion of the
rock music which is a driving.

220
00:19:53,96 --> 00:19:59,84
Anti-society force at that stage and
being a musician of some sort. I was.

221
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,89
Only interested attracted by
this expression of culture.

222
00:20:04,65 --> 00:20:06,81
The idea was to somehow have the best of.

223
00:20:07,14 --> 00:20:12,33
City culture while the best
of country like environment.

224
00:20:12,35 --> 00:20:17,34
And if you somehow mix both together
then you'd be really in paradise.

225
00:20:17,36 --> 00:20:21,09
And on top of that because the
ideal of political autonomy.

226
00:20:22,13 --> 00:20:25,94
Been a lot of political repression
at that stage and very much.

227
00:20:25,97 --> 00:20:32,87
This utopian movement of the 60s and 70s
was a response to political repression.

228
00:20:32,89 --> 00:20:37,16
A lot of very straight laced notions
in the way to legislature at

229
00:20:37,16 --> 00:20:41,31
that stage was set up and most of us had
been on the wrong side of the law over.

230
00:20:42,70 --> 00:20:46,00
Everything from drinking in public smoking
marijuana right through to conscription.

231
00:20:47,14 --> 00:20:51,24
So we had very little time
very establishment either law

232
00:20:51,24 --> 00:20:51,93
or police

233
00:20:54,19 --> 00:21:02,05
and i was a totally respectable
mathematics teacher.

234
00:21:02,07 --> 00:21:06,52
I'd tried to become a physicist and
i wasn't quite in the top notch.

235
00:21:07,17 --> 00:21:09,20
Group of students enough to to achieve

236
00:21:09,20 --> 00:21:12,58
that i ended up becoming a teacher is the
only way of financing myself through

237
00:21:12,58 --> 00:21:13,58
university.

238
00:21:13,60 --> 00:21:17,01
I became a teacher but not a very
good one and eventually decided

239
00:21:17,01 --> 00:21:23,26
that educating people for destructive
and non-existent jobs was.

240
00:21:23,28 --> 00:21:26,70
You know limited potential i thought

241
00:21:26,70 --> 00:21:31,07
that create a changing things much
more fundamentally than simply

242
00:21:31,07 --> 00:21:38,60
and educating people in school to
tolerate the system was more practical.

243
00:21:38,61 --> 00:21:45,08
How long after. Not long. And
six months i came here to live.

244
00:21:46,60 --> 00:21:48,33
I since the festival i'd started.

245
00:21:48,43 --> 00:21:51,64
I'd actually before the festival i
decided i was going to live in the north

246
00:21:51,64 --> 00:21:54,11
and rivers commune. The
only questions which one.

247
00:21:54,19 --> 00:21:58,23
I've been up at elance which is right close
to my home looking to settle in there

248
00:21:59,31 --> 00:21:59,32
and.

249
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,96
Didn't feel very welcome at any of the
communists which were being set up up

250
00:22:03,96 --> 00:22:05,21
and down the coast at that time

251
00:22:05,92 --> 00:22:10,29
and the aquarius movement had much more
political strength integrity to it than any

252
00:22:10,29 --> 00:22:12,86
of the previous which were really
just like extended family groups.

253
00:22:13,34 --> 00:22:18,71
And for that reason i joined this commune.

254
00:22:18,73 --> 00:22:20,69
What was it about the book.

255
00:22:20,75 --> 00:22:24,61
It was big at a certain
inertia to it that meant

256
00:22:24,61 --> 00:22:30,39
that personality issues didn't end up
dominating the politics and the ideology.

257
00:22:30,41 --> 00:22:32,00
And in that way the political process

258
00:22:32,77 --> 00:22:36,00
and the corporate structure of this place
were very superior to anything else which

259
00:22:36,00 --> 00:22:40,42
had happened. It gave much
more rights to the individual.

260
00:22:42,04 --> 00:22:46,99
That emerged to.

261
00:22:47,00 --> 00:22:52,40
No because it was never
excessively applied.

262
00:22:52,42 --> 00:22:55,82
I think i can think of many cases where
this community only stayed together because

263
00:22:55,82 --> 00:22:59,09
of its political structure and there
are lots of parallels with other.

264
00:22:59,35 --> 00:23:01,44
Communes at the same
time which didn't have

265
00:23:01,44 --> 00:23:04,47
that political structure
which fell apart and

266
00:23:04,47 --> 00:23:08,88
when the necessary conflicts of
interest turned up there with the forum

267
00:23:08,88 --> 00:23:11,96
and the communication in this
come into to sort out things.

268
00:23:13,13 --> 00:23:16,23
So when we we faced all of
the the big issues that

269
00:23:16,99 --> 00:23:23,64
that any intentional community
faces which is. Work obligations.

270
00:23:23,66 --> 00:23:28,50
Impact on neighbors sharing
resources and ironically

271
00:23:28,50 --> 00:23:35,33
that gets translated into reality
is guns dogs and fences.

272
00:23:37,00 --> 00:23:41,28
That's the bottom line of. Of a conflict.

273
00:23:41,30 --> 00:23:43,76
Often that's just a symptom
of the underlying conflict

274
00:23:43,76 --> 00:23:45,17
but that's where it always bubbles out

275
00:23:45,94 --> 00:23:49,38
and our community did a better job of
managing those subjects than many of the

276
00:23:49,38 --> 00:23:54,46
others with less structure.

277
00:23:56,75 --> 00:24:03,74
That water politics and.
Yes it. Well yes and.

278
00:24:03,76 --> 00:24:06,22
That politics and water politics were not.

279
00:24:06,63 --> 00:24:07,39
Issues

280
00:24:08,12 --> 00:24:11,78
that the corporate structure of the commune
dealt with more regional issues is

281
00:24:11,78 --> 00:24:14,72
that i think possibly for that
reason they got much more nasty

282
00:24:15,74 --> 00:24:18,64
and more involved with
personal power politics.

283
00:24:18,66 --> 00:24:21,00
Rather than with overall
principles and guidelines

284
00:24:22,86 --> 00:24:27,01
and the seems to be.

285
00:24:28,06 --> 00:24:30,09
It's where the individual comes
up against the community.

286
00:24:30,09 --> 00:24:32,05
I think when issues of
water and doper involved

287
00:24:33,16 --> 00:24:36,94
and dope of course was a
financial ticket. It was.

288
00:24:37,79 --> 00:24:39,59
A very quick and easy way
of getting money which is

289
00:24:39,59 --> 00:24:45,10
that thing which is most
short in supply here. And.

290
00:24:45,11 --> 00:24:47,05
The dole was equally powerful but

291
00:24:47,05 --> 00:24:52,36
that didn't really impinge nearly so much
on the community structure was water

292
00:24:52,37 --> 00:24:52,75
and dope.

293
00:24:52,85 --> 00:24:57,42
Both were strong incentives for people to
work in an actively anti-social manner

294
00:24:57,42 --> 00:25:04,25
for their own gain. And
that's what happened.

295
00:25:04,96 --> 00:25:08,37
I think so yes. With water.

296
00:25:09,38 --> 00:25:11,16
It was come compounded by the fact

297
00:25:11,16 --> 00:25:13,90
that most people don't
understand how water works.

298
00:25:13,92 --> 00:25:18,76
It's intellectually difficult particularly
for people with dope addled brains

299
00:25:19,68 --> 00:25:24,53
and i think most of the what is seen as
blatant unbelievable self-interest was

300
00:25:24,53 --> 00:25:27,05
actually not quite as simple as that but.

301
00:25:27,07 --> 00:25:31,69
Really a combination of
self-interest and confusion

302
00:25:33,63 --> 00:25:37,54
and a tendency to paranoia. In other words
you assume that if there's no water.

303
00:25:37,74 --> 00:25:40,22
It's your neighbor's fault rather than
because there's an airlock in the pipe

304
00:25:41,89 --> 00:25:44,41
and i think it's something
deep in your mind nature to

305
00:25:44,41 --> 00:25:47,58
when our fundamental resources are
threatened either land or water.

306
00:25:47,87 --> 00:25:49,95
We immediately try to blame somebody.

307
00:25:50,11 --> 00:25:53,23
Rather than to look at what the
real problem is it's instinctive

308
00:25:55,16 --> 00:26:00,46
and people tended to have a lot of i was
here first type of mentality. Who's water.

309
00:26:00,76 --> 00:26:03,37
That shift to a place where
there was a reliable stream

310
00:26:04,12 --> 00:26:07,49
and then be unwilling to share
it. Not realising that water.

311
00:26:08,16 --> 00:26:11,38
Is really very much public property.

312
00:26:11,40 --> 00:26:15,01
I mean even in mainstream australia it's
public property except out west where you

313
00:26:15,01 --> 00:26:16,35
can buy and sell water rights

314
00:26:17,21 --> 00:26:24,62
but they aren't you can't
just sort of grab water.

315
00:26:25,37 --> 00:26:28,05
Times and events.

316
00:26:28,07 --> 00:26:32,75
All right from the beginning i saw a
problem in that people were taken out of.

317
00:26:33,14 --> 00:26:35,94
What it called a fully serviced
environment in the suburbs

318
00:26:36,96 --> 00:26:38,96
and dropped in orbit very
beautiful surroundings

319
00:26:38,96 --> 00:26:42,29
but surroundings in which nearly all of
the fundamental surfaces were missing.

320
00:26:43,83 --> 00:26:48,14
And suddenly the issues of
well let's run through them.

321
00:26:48,16 --> 00:26:54,77
No sewage pipes no water pipes no roads.

322
00:26:55,63 --> 00:27:00,68
No phone lines. No electricity.

323
00:27:01,76 --> 00:27:05,68
Ok i think i've run through five
fundamental services or missing.

324
00:27:05,70 --> 00:27:10,11
And it was very difficult for people to
accommodate to the enormous sudden drop in

325
00:27:10,11 --> 00:27:14,52
their standard of living and they
were both psychologically unprepared

326
00:27:14,52 --> 00:27:19,21
and physically unprepared to take
that step back in servicing level

327
00:27:20,56 --> 00:27:23,74
and i could run through each one of
those five services and the mess ups

328
00:27:23,74 --> 00:27:27,63
that happened as a result of people's
attempts to get away. To do without them.

329
00:27:29,09 --> 00:27:30,50
And that i think it's a story

330
00:27:30,50 --> 00:27:34,87
that this community as much as it's political
story as much as it's social story

331
00:27:35,76 --> 00:27:41,80
the story of the effect of withdrawal of
services from people one instinct like

332
00:27:41,80 --> 00:27:44,02
i've just mentioned is that
people for the fight for what.

333
00:27:44,06 --> 00:27:49,89
What is so you get power politics
and territory power to. Politics.

334
00:27:50,06 --> 00:27:51,97
Based on the roads.

335
00:27:52,35 --> 00:27:53,57
The electricity which is here

336
00:27:55,05 --> 00:27:58,96
and the other side of this you get people
suffering terrible deprivation through

337
00:27:58,96 --> 00:27:59,82
not knowing how to get a.

338
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,53
On the lack of those services in the first
year we had a lot of the uman labor

339
00:28:05,51 --> 00:28:07,96
being expended carrying
containers of water up hills.

340
00:28:09,62 --> 00:28:10,33
People didn't realize

341
00:28:10,33 --> 00:28:13,84
that there was actually abundant water
at high altitude here just a question of

342
00:28:13,84 --> 00:28:15,73
knowing how to pipe it. But

343
00:28:15,74 --> 00:28:18,82
that total lack of skill of dealing
with fundamental resources

344
00:28:18,82 --> 00:28:27,80
and how to supply them for self
caused an awful lot of suffering.

345
00:28:28,80 --> 00:28:32,07
Oh enormous we had houses burned
down by people using candles.

346
00:28:32,26 --> 00:28:35,96
We had our first fatality on the property
i think was a baby but to death.

347
00:28:37,94 --> 00:28:41,56
It was a second. Wasn't it. Anyway
the point is that we had deaths.

348
00:28:41,75 --> 00:28:44,95
We had great suffering caused by people
not knowing how to do without services.

349
00:28:45,60 --> 00:28:49,24
And this is all totally
foreseeable and expectable.

350
00:28:49,25 --> 00:28:51,93
So a lack of electricity cause
people to get burnt to death.

351
00:28:53,62 --> 00:28:58,64
Lack of communication caused people to die
of snakebite that's no telephones lack

352
00:28:58,65 --> 00:29:04,01
of roads caused people to dive many
malnutrition in a couple of examples.

353
00:29:04,03 --> 00:29:10,28
And. The snake death also was
related to lack of roads.

354
00:29:11,37 --> 00:29:13,89
Lack of sewage caused to
have a type of outbreak.

355
00:29:15,23 --> 00:29:20,03
I think one person died of that lack of.

356
00:29:21,25 --> 00:29:21,68
Gone through them

357
00:29:21,68 --> 00:29:26,01
or lack of water caused unbelievable
problems again with health

358
00:29:26,01 --> 00:29:28,55
and with into neighbor conflict.

359
00:29:31,11 --> 00:29:35,50
Coming from.

360
00:29:35,52 --> 00:29:38,36
What i came from a very
practical background.

361
00:29:38,53 --> 00:29:43,92
Because my father was a farmer and my
training was all in in physics and science

362
00:29:45,26 --> 00:29:47,73
and i'd always been in the
canwick and things like that.

363
00:29:47,86 --> 00:29:53,24
So i thought i came he was
a very good skills based.

364
00:29:53,25 --> 00:29:58,26
I was given a few rude shocks early on by
the difficulty of making services work.

365
00:29:58,64 --> 00:29:59,86
The first thing i did.

366
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:01,22
As run up a water pipe and found

367
00:30:01,22 --> 00:30:03,44
that water would not run
down hill through a pipe

368
00:30:03,44 --> 00:30:06,14
that was a bit of a shock to my
conception of how the world works.

369
00:30:06,43 --> 00:30:11,10
Once i learned why there's a bit of a
learning curve thing with nearly everything

370
00:30:11,10 --> 00:30:12,33
everything you have to do.

371
00:30:13,22 --> 00:30:15,80
It took a little while to get
through those early setbacks

372
00:30:17,53 --> 00:30:23,61
but soon we learnt to run water down
pipes. That all started working nicely.

373
00:30:25,24 --> 00:30:29,96
And that's been the story really as last
20 years gradually getting alternative

374
00:30:29,96 --> 00:30:36,74
services going to formulate.

375
00:30:36,76 --> 00:30:41,21
Way. Getting into.

376
00:30:42,28 --> 00:30:45,58
Them forming new.

377
00:30:47,13 --> 00:30:52,35
I actually got interested in rainbow power
after the failure of my efforts to try

378
00:30:52,35 --> 00:30:58,49
and provide servicing to this intentional
community. I had great plans for.

379
00:30:58,51 --> 00:31:02,06
For doing soft impact. Transport.

380
00:31:02,47 --> 00:31:04,99
Water electricity supplies
for the community

381
00:31:06,17 --> 00:31:09,70
and i would call most of those a failure.

382
00:31:10,29 --> 00:31:14,91
Partly on my own fault for under mr
underestimating the difficulties partly

383
00:31:14,92 --> 00:31:17,10
that are the fault of
just not enough capital.

384
00:31:17,11 --> 00:31:20,40
Partly the fault of people not having
confidence that these things could work

385
00:31:21,95 --> 00:31:23,52
and the reactor.
