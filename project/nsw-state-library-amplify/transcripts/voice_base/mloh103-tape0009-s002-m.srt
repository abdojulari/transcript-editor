1
00:00:12,76 --> 00:00:15,11
Yes. Well it was.

2
00:00:17,05 --> 00:00:22,77
What we tried to do was keep a change
of the drug laws on the agenda

3
00:00:24,09 --> 00:00:29,61
and try and confront society
with that most unpopular fact

4
00:00:29,61 --> 00:00:31,59
that it was the.

5
00:00:31,61 --> 00:00:37,76
The prohibition of these substances
which were creating a great deal of the

6
00:00:37,76 --> 00:00:39,11
problems that we had in this society.

7
00:00:43,97 --> 00:00:45,78
It was a pretty frustrating task.

8
00:00:49,94 --> 00:00:54,71
I became aware of the degree of
paranoia that exists in the town.

9
00:00:55,72 --> 00:01:00,82
In this area most households
would have. One member.

10
00:01:02,35 --> 00:01:04,32
Husband wife a lover.

11
00:01:04,75 --> 00:01:05,64
Son

12
00:01:05,64 --> 00:01:12,86
or daughter friend cousin
relative who probably use pot in

13
00:01:12,87 --> 00:01:19,36
some degree and with the attention

14
00:01:19,36 --> 00:01:20,66
that had been focused on them

15
00:01:20,66 --> 00:01:25,76
and big raids helicopter raids
search destroy type missions

16
00:01:26,82 --> 00:01:31,62
that were a regular part
of life here. People be.

17
00:01:31,64 --> 00:01:36,08
Became extremely afraid
to express their opinion.

18
00:01:39,68 --> 00:01:43,98
And that was probably the most significant
thing that i found was the impact

19
00:01:43,98 --> 00:01:47,06
that the drug laws were
having on society in

20
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:51,10
that way people were more prepared to be.

21
00:01:53,19 --> 00:01:58,68
Acquiescent about the laws rather
than to challenge them in the hope

22
00:01:58,68 --> 00:02:04,70
that they wouldn't stand out.
When the. The background scenery.

23
00:02:04,71 --> 00:02:09,45
And that really hasn't
changed. A great deal.

24
00:02:09,47 --> 00:02:12,79
Although there are more and
more people these days.

25
00:02:13,15 --> 00:02:25,42
Prepared to make a statement
publicly about the drug laws.

26
00:02:26,71 --> 00:02:32,48
Are not really elected. So. Well
i in one thousand ninety one.

27
00:02:32,73 --> 00:02:37,71
I stood as an independent candidate on a
drug reform ticket in the state parliament.

28
00:02:38,30 --> 00:02:40,92
Who's a campaign that i
ran pretty much by myself

29
00:02:42,80 --> 00:02:45,55
and it was an opportunity to
play a bit of larrikin politics.

30
00:02:49,79 --> 00:02:53,80
Given that it was just really
a one person campaign.

31
00:02:54,05 --> 00:02:59,86
The two and a half
thousand votes that i got.

32
00:02:59,88 --> 00:03:06,14
Wasn't too bad at all and i did
indicate to some extent the.

33
00:03:08,15 --> 00:03:13,05
The feeling that was here for people.
I vote i ran on a campaign of.

34
00:03:14,30 --> 00:03:19,36
Voting is anonymous. Here is your
chance to put down your opinion.

35
00:03:20,69 --> 00:03:24,38
And for a one one is
single issue campaign it.

36
00:03:25,47 --> 00:03:30,50
It works well but the problem about it.

37
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:36,73
The problem that i see that came
as a consequence of my actions is

38
00:03:36,73 --> 00:03:43,04
that it has tended to make the the
anti-drug lobby less likely to stand up

39
00:03:43,04 --> 00:03:48,92
and do things. Whilst at the same time.

40
00:03:48,94 --> 00:03:56,04
The negative consequences
of provisions continue.

41
00:03:56,06 --> 00:03:59,86
And so they're largely
unchecked this to me is that.

42
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,81
Challenge of the alternative society
of the nimh and society is to somehow

43
00:04:03,81 --> 00:04:05,04
or other.

44
00:04:05,06 --> 00:04:10,35
Set into play the factors in society

45
00:04:11,41 --> 00:04:17,52
that work towards sorting out these problems
in such a way as the community itself

46
00:04:17,52 --> 00:04:19,56
and the people within the community.

47
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:23,72
Are empowered that they are able to
realise that they can effect change.

48
00:04:25,79 --> 00:04:31,21
The marijuana laws seem a bit like the weak
weak chink in the armor because they're

49
00:04:31,21 --> 00:04:36,05
so blatantly problematic laws their laws

50
00:04:36,05 --> 00:04:39,44
that don't hold up to scrutiny in any way.

51
00:04:41,90 --> 00:04:48,61
It seemed like this was a way that the
whole of society. Could be challenged.

52
00:04:51,88 --> 00:04:53,21
But difficult go

53
00:04:53,21 --> 00:05:03,04
and it really is difficult going on.

54
00:05:03,06 --> 00:05:05,33
I ran. Yeah i.

55
00:05:06,89 --> 00:05:07,39
As part of

56
00:05:07,39 --> 00:05:14,75
that campaign nimbin did.

57
00:05:15,87 --> 00:05:19,58
Create it's the options are
available here and him

58
00:05:19,58 --> 00:05:26,44
and allowed me to campaign in pretty
many creative ways one of the ways was

59
00:05:26,44 --> 00:05:27,83
the.

60
00:05:29,40 --> 00:05:35,66
Advertising on television a local media
organisation offered to do ads for me.

61
00:05:35,67 --> 00:05:41,42
They. Program them or arranged
for them to be programmed in.

62
00:05:43,67 --> 00:05:46,80
And that was a bit of a first for.
Well it was a first for them.

63
00:05:47,10 --> 00:05:53,42
And it was a first for a local
television up in this area.

64
00:05:55,42 --> 00:05:57,30
Yeah not much else i can
say about it. Really.

65
00:06:05,97 --> 00:06:10,94
No i don't know that there's
been marijuana campaign

66
00:06:10,94 --> 00:06:16,20
or marijuana party campaigners in other
electorates another election on this

67
00:06:18,47 --> 00:06:19,70
but this was the first time

68
00:06:20,49 --> 00:06:27,37
that there's been a local
marijuana party type campaign run

69
00:06:27,37 --> 00:06:30,29
up here. The elections were
great because they did offer

70
00:06:30,29 --> 00:06:33,03
that opportunity for
the focus on an issue.

71
00:06:36,74 --> 00:06:43,74
I ran a very much a sort of barefoot
politician campaign running without

72
00:06:43,74 --> 00:06:44,87
a great deal of funds

73
00:06:44,87 --> 00:06:51,63
and without a great deal of visible
upfront support you know terms of

74
00:06:51,63 --> 00:06:54,93
people you know i had nobody
staffing polling booths.

75
00:06:56,62 --> 00:07:01,06
It was very difficult to get people to
make any sort of commitment in which they

76
00:07:01,06 --> 00:07:03,28
publicly committed
themselves for drug reform

77
00:07:05,14 --> 00:07:13,75
or drug law reform.

78
00:07:13,76 --> 00:07:16,90
You know

79
00:07:23,48 --> 00:07:26,59
the degree of paranoia there
was here surprised me.

80
00:07:27,57 --> 00:07:31,71
Didn't shake my faith in the.

81
00:07:32,49 --> 00:07:35,17
In the nature of the name and community.

82
00:07:36,14 --> 00:07:41,12
It made me aware of just the
pressures that people are under.

83
00:07:41,14 --> 00:07:48,89
And made me see just how much of a
backbone marijuana is to the economy here.

84
00:07:50,43 --> 00:07:54,57
And it made me realize that any
change that i did try and institute

85
00:07:54,57 --> 00:07:57,63
or if i was able to be successful
in bringing about a change.

86
00:07:57,89 --> 00:07:59,90
It would have severely affected
the lives of a lot of.

87
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:01,52
People so i've been caught on

88
00:08:01,52 --> 00:08:07,73
that sort of dilemma between
keeping people here

89
00:08:09,98 --> 00:08:12,38
in a sustainable income

90
00:08:13,62 --> 00:08:19,15
and yet at the same time trying to
eliminate those negative aspects of it.

91
00:08:22,40 --> 00:08:28,94
If marijuana was sold on a through a growing
cooperative basis marketed by a local

92
00:08:28,94 --> 00:08:34,54
organization that did pay taxes back into
the community not back into the states

93
00:08:34,54 --> 00:08:35,69
and federal communities

94
00:08:35,69 --> 00:08:40,17
but back into the local community
then we'd have a lot of the

95
00:08:43,42 --> 00:08:47,62
a lot of the negative effects of the
marijuana trade would be diminished a lot of

96
00:08:47,62 --> 00:08:48,38
the imperatives

97
00:08:48,38 --> 00:08:52,79
that are there in the marijuana trade
the need for people to earn an income.

98
00:08:54,17 --> 00:08:54,50
To try

99
00:08:54,50 --> 00:09:04,26
and pander to their
consumption desires the

100
00:09:04,26 --> 00:09:06,06
degree of hypocrisy

101
00:09:06,06 --> 00:09:11,13
that was in society kids were find it very
difficult here because they were seeing

102
00:09:11,13 --> 00:09:14,89
their parents smoke and pot
selling pot in a lot of cases

103
00:09:16,42 --> 00:09:23,38
and yet. Having to publicly
present a different persona.

104
00:09:28,09 --> 00:09:30,76
And at the same time telling their
kids to keep away from drugs.

105
00:09:32,93 --> 00:09:35,94
It only really served to
make the situation worse.

106
00:09:36,20 --> 00:09:40,29
The kids were getting
into drugs marijuana.

107
00:09:40,57 --> 00:09:43,44
But also alcohol and every now

108
00:09:43,44 --> 00:09:48,68
and again some of the local kids would
resort to using chemical substances

109
00:09:49,60 --> 00:09:55,71
but in a lot of cases.
My experience shows me

110
00:09:55,71 --> 00:09:59,95
that those people who are more
inclined towards getting into.

111
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,85
Things like heroin those who really feel
a lot of pain in society whether that's

112
00:10:06,85 --> 00:10:12,65
from broken homes from. Brutal parenting.

113
00:10:13,34 --> 00:10:20,06
From being in lower
socioeconomic situations.

114
00:10:21,75 --> 00:10:24,12
I don't believe that the.

115
00:10:25,43 --> 00:10:29,52
That the fact that marijuana is
illegal and that people use it.

116
00:10:29,55 --> 00:10:31,50
Lead people on to heroin use.

117
00:10:33,04 --> 00:10:37,62
I believe that people get into heroin
use to try and eliminate the pain.

118
00:10:37,93 --> 00:10:40,78
That they feel in their lives.

119
00:10:42,53 --> 00:10:46,01
And just like the sly grog dealers.

120
00:10:46,02 --> 00:10:51,72
And the brothels went to the
goldfields in the 1850s in ballarat

121
00:10:51,72 --> 00:10:54,97
and in the goldfields other
goldfields in australia.

122
00:10:57,15 --> 00:11:02,89
And preyed on the miners so
to do the heroin dealers.

123
00:11:02,91 --> 00:11:06,93
Come to nimbin and.

124
00:11:06,95 --> 00:11:13,53
Use the local float large
floating amount of money that's

125
00:11:13,53 --> 00:11:16,76
there as a source of.

126
00:11:16,78 --> 00:11:27,08
Gain for them in return for heroin.

127
00:11:30,08 --> 00:11:34,87
With my own kids. Smoking
pot was one of those things

128
00:11:34,87 --> 00:11:41,55
that i tried not to encourage and
it came as a bit of a shock.

129
00:11:41,62 --> 00:11:48,20
The first time that i
found. My eldest daughter.

130
00:11:48,65 --> 00:11:50,62
Was smoking.

131
00:11:51,94 --> 00:11:56,97
And it made me realise just what my
own real aspirations for her were.

132
00:11:57,51 --> 00:12:04,20
And my own. Free.

133
00:12:05,26 --> 00:12:07,56
We are an attitude. I
just want my free will

134
00:12:07,56 --> 00:12:12,64
and attitude was really
worse in relation to drugs.

135
00:12:13,87 --> 00:12:19,11
I've subsequently modified. This
approach out of my children.

136
00:12:19,67 --> 00:12:21,27
Three out of the four smoke

137
00:12:23,43 --> 00:12:30,00
and basically they cope
with it reasonably well i

138
00:12:32,10 --> 00:12:35,57
i myself wouldn't promote the
use of marijuana by anybody

139
00:12:36,26 --> 00:12:37,00
or for anybody

140
00:12:39,44 --> 00:12:46,07
but at the same time i can't
put down people who do smoke.

141
00:12:48,15 --> 00:12:52,86
So i've had to take for myself.

142
00:12:53,11 --> 00:12:55,79
Part of the responsibility for
setting this particular example

143
00:13:02,09 --> 00:13:08,86
i've also tried to educate them into what
i consider to be an etiquette of smoking.

144
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:14,75
You don't rip off your friends
or you don't rip off anybody.

145
00:13:14,96 --> 00:13:18,06
If you're going to provide
marijuana it's possible

146
00:13:18,06 --> 00:13:20,99
that everyone can provided them selves.

147
00:13:21,01 --> 00:13:24,07
So i've encouraged them to grow their own

148
00:13:28,33 --> 00:13:34,56
to look upon it in that sacramental
way that marijuana really years.

149
00:13:36,37 --> 00:13:38,14
For instance.

150
00:13:40,01 --> 00:13:44,16
In traditional societies substances

151
00:13:44,17 --> 00:13:47,23
that change consciousness
have always had a place

152
00:13:47,23 --> 00:13:51,57
but the places been well
defined within society.

153
00:13:53,78 --> 00:13:58,73
They generally have a particular
outcome their guided their the people.

154
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,67
Who god are experienced
over a long period of

155
00:14:06,67 --> 00:14:12,48
learning in how to deal with the
effects of the consciousness changing.

156
00:14:12,88 --> 00:14:18,47
Substance. What we've done in our society
is we've dropped right away from

157
00:14:18,47 --> 00:14:20,36
that it's.

158
00:14:23,30 --> 00:14:30,09
There's no cultural controls at all
on how the consciousness changing

159
00:14:30,09 --> 00:14:31,75
drugs are used in society.

160
00:14:34,59 --> 00:14:41,08
So they used randomly they use
wildly they used in a way

161
00:14:41,08 --> 00:14:47,63
that is more for a particular immediate

162
00:14:48,91 --> 00:14:53,90
gratification rather than seen
in the context of of growth and.

163
00:14:54,47 --> 00:14:59,94
As a means of both handling society
and investigating deeper truths

164
00:14:59,94 --> 00:15:07,57
that exist within society.

165
00:15:10,96 --> 00:15:15,33
A lot of people do come
to nimbin with probably.

166
00:15:17,43 --> 00:15:23,13
A slightly incorrect view of
what niman is going to be like

167
00:15:24,44 --> 00:15:28,68
because the mainstream society generally
doesn't allow for a great deal of

168
00:15:28,68 --> 00:15:32,44
interpersonal communication
randomly amongst people.

169
00:15:33,91 --> 00:15:40,78
People come here looking for a section
community interaction a sense

170
00:15:40,78 --> 00:15:47,76
of been important in themselves and
a lot of them don't find that here.

171
00:15:49,71 --> 00:15:53,98
Ultimately it's all within themselves it's
all within ourselves this capability to

172
00:15:55,96 --> 00:16:00,88
create our new society along
the way that. We want to.

173
00:16:00,97 --> 00:16:05,96
We've bound so much by what's been
fed into us by society in the past.

174
00:16:07,92 --> 00:16:13,23
That we are limited in what we are
able to actually achieve a lot of the

175
00:16:13,23 --> 00:16:17,49
communities around here. If you view it.

176
00:16:18,57 --> 00:16:20,00
Dispassionately you'll find

177
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:26,96
that they're just housing estates where
people don't necessarily have a great deal

178
00:16:26,96 --> 00:16:33,08
of contact with their their neighbours
with the community they buy a share

179
00:16:33,98 --> 00:16:38,64
in a lot of cases that's just a predetermined
allotment they build their houses

180
00:16:38,64 --> 00:16:44,53
they build their gardens in a way that's
quite similar to the suburban dream

181
00:16:45,73 --> 00:16:49,69
that has grabbed them even
though they don't realize that

182
00:16:49,69 --> 00:16:54,24
when they come here they're still
bound by this suburban dream

183
00:16:55,13 --> 00:16:59,31
but i really like what timothy leary said
about the decline of the flower children

184
00:17:00,01 --> 00:17:05,10
the flower children may be gone but
they've spread their seeds and it's

185
00:17:05,10 --> 00:17:10,12
when the seeds take root. That will see
the real flowering of the new society.

186
00:17:10,63 --> 00:17:15,38
I tend to think that that that's
happening more and more i see a change.

187
00:17:15,77 --> 00:17:20,83
That's coming about in a lot of the young
people particularly the young people here

188
00:17:20,83 --> 00:17:21,99
in.

189
00:17:22,01 --> 00:17:23,80
As they grow

190
00:17:25,15 --> 00:17:31,51
and it almost parallels the
growth of the nimbin alternative

191
00:17:31,52 --> 00:17:35,11
society itself at 20 years old.

192
00:17:35,98 --> 00:17:40,85
All we are is a society
barely out of adolescence.

193
00:17:42,78 --> 00:17:48,43
There's a lot of grown to do. There's a
lot of maturing a lot of wisdom too.

194
00:17:49,16 --> 00:17:55,63
To get a lot of implementing of
what we've learnt in our society.

195
00:17:56,48 --> 00:17:58,70
It's happening it's
happening all the time and.

196
00:18:00,86 --> 00:18:03,24
Five years ago there was
an environment centre.

197
00:18:03,69 --> 00:18:09,13
There hasn't been a lot of the organizations
rainbow power company hadn't congealed

198
00:18:09,13 --> 00:18:12,77
into an actual working group.

199
00:18:12,79 --> 00:18:18,43
A lot of the health networks the support
networks that exist here weren't here.

200
00:18:18,76 --> 00:18:21,38
The holes that have been
built on the communities

201
00:18:21,38 --> 00:18:27,56
that the community consultation processes
that have come more and more into play.

202
00:18:29,69 --> 00:18:34,95
To me are evidence of the alternative
society actually getting its act together

203
00:18:36,30 --> 00:18:41,33
bringing the lessons from what they've
learnt on the home communities into the

204
00:18:41,33 --> 00:18:45,98
public life of nimbin now
and then is benefiting.

205
00:18:47,17 --> 00:18:52,00
Substantially from the experiences of
these new settlers. But like everywhere.

206
00:18:52,47 --> 00:18:54,49
Once a society starts to flourish.

207
00:18:55,14 --> 00:19:01,56
You do also get an attraction by a lot
of people who see an active social

208
00:19:02,71 --> 00:19:04,37
cultural life go and down.

209
00:19:05,65 --> 00:19:10,52
Are visible in the streets a lifestyle

210
00:19:10,52 --> 00:19:16,94
that can attract them as holding the key
to their own personal inner turmoil

211
00:19:19,74 --> 00:19:24,80
but the reality still is very
much of an emerging society.

212
00:19:26,15 --> 00:19:32,74
It's frustrating for a lot of people who
do come here with a lot of needs for with

213
00:19:32,74 --> 00:19:37,77
a lot of the motional
needs mental disturbance.

214
00:19:41,40 --> 00:19:45,64
Well look it's frustrating for a
lot of people who come here with.

215
00:19:45,92 --> 00:19:50,44
Or seeking an emotional
and so to the things

216
00:19:50,44 --> 00:19:54,18
that prevail within the dominant society

217
00:19:58,76 --> 00:20:02,33
and they come here and find that. People
are still basically the same people.

218
00:20:02,63 --> 00:20:06,74
It's like when you meet somebody famous
basically they're still the same person.

219
00:20:06,75 --> 00:20:11,38
They probably got a bit of breakfast
dangling on the front of their shirt their

220
00:20:11,39 --> 00:20:17,58
human i mean this is one of the lessons
that is really good to learn here that.

221
00:20:17,59 --> 00:20:22,33
That if you want this ideal society you
have to sort of dredge it out from within

222
00:20:22,33 --> 00:20:26,46
yourself find it find that sense
of strength and courage that

223
00:20:27,25 --> 00:20:33,18
that is there. And just go for we've
got everything to lose at the moment.

224
00:20:34,72 --> 00:20:39,36
Society is just hanging on the
edge and nimbin to me has

225
00:20:39,36 --> 00:20:42,61
that capability to create
some state of health.

226
00:20:43,02 --> 00:20:49,70
If you have your whole society affected
by disease then it means the disease

227
00:20:49,70 --> 00:20:53,48
is able to grow and spread
in order to counteract

228
00:20:53,48 --> 00:20:57,58
that you have to create some sort
of pocket of health that will grow

229
00:20:57,58 --> 00:21:00,84
and spread affect the areas around it.

230
00:21:01,86 --> 00:21:08,32
Because an immense connotations of an
alternative vision airy prophetic society.

231
00:21:08,52 --> 00:21:09,49
It seems to me

232
00:21:10,30 --> 00:21:16,55
that we've got the groundwork set in place
here to create some element of society

233
00:21:16,55 --> 00:21:20,20
or health and from

234
00:21:20,20 --> 00:21:26,18
that if we can just hang on long enough
then the change will happen we'll be able

235
00:21:26,18 --> 00:21:45,30
to spread what we've learnt
out into the rest of society.

236
00:21:49,70 --> 00:21:52,86
What do i currently in nor what do i hope

237
00:21:52,86 --> 00:21:58,87
that they'll achieve what i when i
look at the kids around this area.

238
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:00,21
What on.

239
00:22:00,62 --> 00:22:07,07
Likely to see is

240
00:22:08,42 --> 00:22:09,59
or what i'm likely to see

241
00:22:09,59 --> 00:22:14,29
when i look at the kids in this
area are the lessons already learnt

242
00:22:14,29 --> 00:22:20,38
that we their parents took a
great deal of time to learn.

243
00:22:20,60 --> 00:22:24,97
Sometimes in our thirties forties fifties.

244
00:22:24,99 --> 00:22:31,17
We've still going through the
pain of experiencing things

245
00:22:31,18 --> 00:22:36,06
that have been kept from
us with kids today in them

246
00:22:36,06 --> 00:22:40,85
and they tend to be much more mature
experienced in a lot of the things

247
00:22:40,85 --> 00:22:43,98
that were never talked about.
As part of our generation.

248
00:22:44,59 --> 00:22:50,76
They seem to be able to cope
with change a lot better.

249
00:22:51,47 --> 00:22:57,44
They seem to be more likely to be commune

250
00:22:57,44 --> 00:23:03,05
or to be supporting of each other

251
00:23:06,87 --> 00:23:12,99
they tend to go through a in a lot
of cases despair frustration.

252
00:23:13,30 --> 00:23:19,68
Just like most other kids but
for the ones who grow up here.

253
00:23:19,79 --> 00:23:21,60
I'm really impressed with the way

254
00:23:21,60 --> 00:23:28,22
that they actually do seem to find a
path at some point which becomes really

255
00:23:28,22 --> 00:23:29,68
solid.

256
00:23:29,70 --> 00:23:30,89
Because it young it has

257
00:23:30,89 --> 00:23:37,62
that energy that's able to achieve
things i got a great deal of hope in the

258
00:23:37,62 --> 00:23:42,73
future when i look at the kids
that i've grown up with here.
