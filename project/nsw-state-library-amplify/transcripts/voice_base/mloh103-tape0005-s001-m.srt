1
00:00:18,68 --> 00:00:21,92
Right okay well i'm harry freeman.

2
00:00:21,93 --> 00:00:27,07
And i'm 48 and aquarian

3
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:30,08
and aquarian monkey in the chinese.

4
00:00:31,70 --> 00:00:35,13
Way of looking at astrology.

5
00:00:35,86 --> 00:00:41,59
And i now work as the director of psychiatric
services up in this part of the state

6
00:00:42,88 --> 00:00:47,74
running a psychiatric unit and the
community services around here.

7
00:00:48,76 --> 00:00:51,10
I've always been interested
in psychiatry those

8
00:00:51,10 --> 00:00:57,19
that was my that's my career to
some extent my passion i guess.

9
00:00:57,21 --> 00:01:04,20
And i came to the equerry
as first of all because of

10
00:01:04,20 --> 00:01:10,55
my connection at the
time to student politics

11
00:01:10,55 --> 00:01:17,00
which had taken a rather
theatrical sort of turn i think.

12
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:23,50
By the early 70s of course i was university
from 1960 to 67 in medical school.

13
00:01:25,49 --> 00:01:31,10
And the moratoria about vietnam and
those sorts of things were happening.

14
00:01:31,11 --> 00:01:34,79
When i was beginning my
internships as a medic.

15
00:01:34,89 --> 00:01:37,84
So i was active in left wing politics

16
00:01:37,85 --> 00:01:44,19
and still active to some extent
in as i said the more theatrical

17
00:01:44,19 --> 00:01:50,57
parts of student politics consequently i
was good friends with with graham dunstan

18
00:01:50,57 --> 00:01:53,19
and with various people
who were still on campus.

19
00:01:54,18 --> 00:01:59,88
Even though i'd left campus and
so i was identified i sell far.

20
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,75
Identified myself with

21
00:02:02,76 --> 00:02:08,51
that group of people who were
talking about the counterculture.

22
00:02:10,45 --> 00:02:15,69
That was. A peculiar sort of
liaison i suppose between the left

23
00:02:16,90 --> 00:02:21,30
and this rather more anarchy
whole group of people.

24
00:02:22,64 --> 00:02:24,22
But i guess for me.

25
00:02:26,41 --> 00:02:30,30
I right through medical school and even.

26
00:02:30,32 --> 00:02:33,44
Then as a young doctor.

27
00:02:33,45 --> 00:02:37,86
And certainly in the beginning
of my training in psychiatry.

28
00:02:39,84 --> 00:02:41,94
I didn't have the same.

29
00:02:42,63 --> 00:02:49,14
Connection to doctors as
many of my colleagues did

30
00:02:49,92 --> 00:02:51,02
for some reason.

31
00:02:51,68 --> 00:02:57,51
I couldn't make the sort of tribal
connection to the rest of the doctors

32
00:02:58,75 --> 00:03:03,05
that a lot of people did not that i wasn't
a good doctor and highly regarded and.

33
00:03:04,54 --> 00:03:10,29
And. Fond of the whole
idea of being a doctor.

34
00:03:10,31 --> 00:03:15,40
But it certainly didn't satisfy a need
for a tribal connection which i felt

35
00:03:16,95 --> 00:03:20,57
and which people like graham and.

36
00:03:20,58 --> 00:03:26,24
The more active an interesting student
politicians did represent forming.

37
00:03:26,26 --> 00:03:30,62
So. When in.

38
00:03:30,64 --> 00:03:37,09
I suppose it was like 1970 to due
to my. Various pollution a journey.

39
00:03:37,49 --> 00:03:41,06
Connections to graham. He talked about.

40
00:03:41,81 --> 00:03:48,24
Doing a festival at
nimbin. I am mediately.

41
00:03:49,67 --> 00:03:54,96
Said well i guess we all need some sort
of medical people there are you would

42
00:03:54,96 --> 00:03:59,95
remember now you might not
remember but. Woodstock the film.

43
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,37
Woodstock.

44
00:04:03,39 --> 00:04:07,85
Made quite a bit of the
sort of medical problems

45
00:04:07,86 --> 00:04:14,19
that arose in in the context of bad
trips but also cuts and bruises

46
00:04:14,19 --> 00:04:16,14
and god knows what all that happens

47
00:04:16,14 --> 00:04:22,40
when thousands of people suddenly find
themselves together in fairly unsanitary

48
00:04:22,40 --> 00:04:26,53
conditions. So i said to graham

49
00:04:26,53 --> 00:04:32,94
that i would coordinate the medical
side of things for the festival.

50
00:04:33,87 --> 00:04:37,26
And so i just gathered a group of.

51
00:04:37,28 --> 00:04:42,49
My fellow psychiatric registrars as a matter
of fact we were all in psych training

52
00:04:43,56 --> 00:04:45,80
and said you know we want to go
up to nimbin for the festival

53
00:04:47,20 --> 00:04:52,85
and so we went up on a preliminary
visit to nimbin and discovered

54
00:04:52,85 --> 00:04:55,81
that there was a hospital there but
it had been closed for many years

55
00:04:55,81 --> 00:04:56,48
and there was just.

56
00:04:58,07 --> 00:05:02,49
A sister working at the hospital sort of
keeping it open because there wasn't even

57
00:05:02,49 --> 00:05:07,31
a doctor in the town it was a dying town
and too small to support a town doctor.

58
00:05:08,60 --> 00:05:12,25
And we came to the base
hospital in lismore.

59
00:05:12,26 --> 00:05:16,35
With very long hair and short shorts
and the ids and all the rest of it.

60
00:05:17,34 --> 00:05:22,87
And beads and said to a rather astonished
administration here at the hospital

61
00:05:22,87 --> 00:05:28,71
that they'd better open this hospital
up. And that we would indeed man it.

62
00:05:28,73 --> 00:05:31,77
And woman it and look after it
for the time of the festival

63
00:05:33,07 --> 00:05:37,45
and strangely enough despite our bizarre
appearance all that they required was

64
00:05:37,45 --> 00:05:39,72
that we show evidence that
we were indeed doctors

65
00:05:39,72 --> 00:05:42,82
and there they were they staff
the hospital with nurses

66
00:05:42,82 --> 00:05:48,76
and i handed over the hospital to me and
my cohorts. So there i was at nimbin.

67
00:05:49,12 --> 00:05:53,70
With the rest of my tribe. And friends.

68
00:05:55,71 --> 00:05:59,81
I was sort of. Wandering between
the the camp that we made.

69
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,68
What on malcolm creek and
the hospital and so i was.

70
00:06:05,12 --> 00:06:08,01
Very much there and.

71
00:06:08,81 --> 00:06:08,93
More

72
00:06:08,94 --> 00:06:17,96
and more i guess the idea of rejecting

73
00:06:17,97 --> 00:06:22,69
the dominant paradigm and being
able to rejected both in practical

74
00:06:23,53 --> 00:06:29,60
and in personal terms. Was stamped
informing so i saw myself.

75
00:06:30,16 --> 00:06:35,02
I was living in group homes and
commune all houses in sydney. Anyway.

76
00:06:35,55 --> 00:06:39,81
Although married me and my wife.

77
00:06:40,68 --> 00:06:44,84
Both lived in houses where there were a
lot of other people living so the idea of

78
00:06:44,84 --> 00:06:50,83
living with a group of like minded souls
rather than just known fahmi was.

79
00:06:50,85 --> 00:06:56,02
Again stamped in for me at the
festival so i and a few of.

80
00:06:56,04 --> 00:07:01,50
My immediate friends bought a
farm. While we were there.

81
00:07:02,53 --> 00:07:06,01
It cost us nine thousand dollars
for the 200 acres of nimbin.

82
00:07:06,51 --> 00:07:10,74
And of course the locals thought we
were absolute fools for even paying

83
00:07:10,74 --> 00:07:11,82
that much money for.

84
00:07:12,51 --> 00:07:16,84
This piece of dirt but we
were quite captivated with it

85
00:07:16,84 --> 00:07:20,17
and we could all see that.

86
00:07:21,57 --> 00:07:25,54
We did want to live community and
most of us felt that one way

87
00:07:25,54 --> 00:07:29,96
or another we could probably find some sort
of employment up here certainly for me

88
00:07:29,96 --> 00:07:36,28
i knew there was no doubt because there was
no psychiatric service up here in 1973.

89
00:07:36,80 --> 00:07:41,08
At all. And one of the other
doctors that i brought up with me.

90
00:07:42,22 --> 00:07:44,24
Decided as soon as he hit.

91
00:07:44,26 --> 00:07:47,17
Town that he indeed was going
to come up here and say

92
00:07:47,17 --> 00:07:50,30
and start a psychiatric service
and that he would need a friend

93
00:07:50,30 --> 00:07:51,50
and a partner to do that.

94
00:07:53,08 --> 00:07:56,19
So it was simply remained for
me to go back to sydney then

95
00:07:56,19 --> 00:07:59,96
and qualify which i did
the next year in 74.

96
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,92
All and then i i was doing a
research project in sydney.

97
00:08:06,94 --> 00:08:10,32
So i didn't actually come
here and start work till 75.

98
00:08:10,42 --> 00:08:16,93
Although from 73 on i mean every holiday
since we had the farm up here we would all

99
00:08:16,93 --> 00:08:19,02
come here and indeed one of one

100
00:08:19,02 --> 00:08:22,77
or two of the people moved up
by the end of seventy three.

101
00:08:24,38 --> 00:08:28,30
And so we had the farm and we
decided to live communally

102
00:08:28,31 --> 00:08:33,89
and to try to share as much as we could.

103
00:08:33,91 --> 00:08:36,39
So that stage.

104
00:08:37,27 --> 00:08:42,85
The tribal nature of the migration

105
00:08:44,19 --> 00:08:46,57
was pretty clear to me and my friends

106
00:08:46,57 --> 00:08:50,28
that was what we wanted a
sense of community that.

107
00:08:50,30 --> 00:08:53,96
In fact pretty actively
rejected the dominant culture.

108
00:08:55,39 --> 00:08:58,93
But its very hard to reject the
dominant culture so we weren't.

109
00:08:59,46 --> 00:09:01,70
I mean we decided to get onto the grid

110
00:09:02,71 --> 00:09:06,25
and we indeed i think the farm was hooked
up to electricity when we bought it

111
00:09:06,25 --> 00:09:09,39
and we didn't chop down a telephone
pass or anything like that.

112
00:09:10,66 --> 00:09:16,99
So what we did i guess as a group of
people who were. You know capable of.

113
00:09:18,36 --> 00:09:22,68
Feeling comfortable about a level of
compromise and accommodation up we came and

114
00:09:22,68 --> 00:09:25,07
and joined the tribe here and.

115
00:09:25,75 --> 00:09:30,74
Various of us got part time jobs and others
just stayed at home on the farm and.

116
00:09:31,38 --> 00:09:36,21
We tried as much as we could to to.

117
00:09:36,22 --> 00:09:40,51
To reject simple sort of nuclear
living and nuclear aspirations

118
00:09:40,51 --> 00:09:47,22
and nuclear family aspirations.
And so that's how i got here.

119
00:09:49,64 --> 00:09:54,78
Back to what. You.

120
00:09:55,60 --> 00:09:59,70
Work in. Yes.

121
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,85
Oh yes no doubt

122
00:10:01,85 --> 00:10:08,27
that the festival worked for
me as an affirmation of the

123
00:10:08,28 --> 00:10:14,57
possibility of really feeling
a sense of belonging with a

124
00:10:14,57 --> 00:10:21,34
very disparate group of people
who were indeed pretty different

125
00:10:21,34 --> 00:10:22,83
from all of the groups

126
00:10:22,83 --> 00:10:28,02
that i'd known before then the possible
groups i mean i could join the medical

127
00:10:28,02 --> 00:10:28,72
tribe but

128
00:10:28,72 --> 00:10:33,98
that had never interested me i could have
gone into politics because i was interested

129
00:10:33,98 --> 00:10:38,47
in that you know at the university but
that particular tribe didn't grab me.

130
00:10:39,64 --> 00:10:45,86
My parents were both successful
schoolteachers and i could have continued on.

131
00:10:46,99 --> 00:10:52,30
As the fairly successful upper middle class
doctor which is what i would have liked

132
00:10:52,30 --> 00:10:55,14
me to be and and move in that.

133
00:10:55,16 --> 00:11:01,34
Tribe but for my for me the.

134
00:11:02,11 --> 00:11:02,99
The dope smoking.

135
00:11:04,05 --> 00:11:09,82
You know mushroomed eating
tribe had much more appeal

136
00:11:10,70 --> 00:11:14,03
and also there. There was quite enough.

137
00:11:14,83 --> 00:11:21,82
Well intellectual stimulation for
me in it. Frankly i felt but.

138
00:11:21,84 --> 00:11:27,51
The group of people who i
who i was living with.

139
00:11:27,53 --> 00:11:32,80
Were wonderfully creatively
intelligent and bright.

140
00:11:32,86 --> 00:11:39,60
I mean they were not in any way behind
any group of people with respect to

141
00:11:39,60 --> 00:11:44,28
having the sort of intellectual can't
contact that i wanted it seemed to me

142
00:11:44,28 --> 00:11:48,19
that they were to the forefront
in the area of ideas in.

143
00:11:48,79 --> 00:11:55,71
In in in an enormous number of areas
they were a very very rich tapestry

144
00:11:55,71 --> 00:11:59,19
of human beings. There was no doubt
in my mind that they were the.

145
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,17
The group that i belong to and
really that i still belong to.

146
00:12:05,70 --> 00:12:09,46
So the festival made it obvious

147
00:12:10,90 --> 00:12:10,92
that

148
00:12:12,55 --> 00:12:18,63
that tribal connectedness was available
to me provided i've migrated

149
00:12:19,47 --> 00:12:25,99
and. You know hang on in through
all the the ambiguity of.

150
00:12:26,71 --> 00:12:32,30
Of the thing because
it would. It would be.

151
00:12:33,25 --> 00:12:38,43
It's not true. To suggest that we had an
ideology even though the counterculture.

152
00:12:39,83 --> 00:12:44,84
And rosek and those sorts of writers would
suggest there was some sort of ideology.

153
00:12:44,92 --> 00:12:49,46
It's not really true. I
mean basically it was to.

154
00:12:50,10 --> 00:12:54,87
To not follow the dominant paradigm
i mean it was a negative ideology

155
00:12:54,87 --> 00:13:01,25
that everything that anybody else was
was hanging onto was probably useless.

156
00:13:02,58 --> 00:13:03,76
So.

157
00:13:03,78 --> 00:13:09,45
If you do have an ideology that's essentially
a negative one which i think is what

158
00:13:09,45 --> 00:13:13,05
we had with all sorts of people.

159
00:13:13,07 --> 00:13:19,21
Pronouncing on their
particular positive ideology

160
00:13:19,21 --> 00:13:21,20
and saying that was what it was all about.

161
00:13:21,79 --> 00:13:26,31
I mean you really had to be able to
tolerate an enormous amount of ambiguity.

162
00:13:26,38 --> 00:13:29,69
You know there are many people who i'm
sure you will talk to who will say

163
00:13:29,69 --> 00:13:35,91
that it was abs that that name and
was about alternative energy or

164
00:13:35,92 --> 00:13:40,35
that nimbin was about.

165
00:13:40,37 --> 00:13:43,81
The art so that niman was about.

166
00:13:45,20 --> 00:13:47,67
Smoking dope.

167
00:13:47,68 --> 00:13:53,44
And indeed it was about all of those
sorts of things but i was never.

168
00:13:54,39 --> 00:13:56,46
I never felt it was about
anything in particular.

169
00:13:57,04 --> 00:13:59,89
Other than the rejection of the dominant.

170
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,89
Paradigm because and i we're you
know in my ignorance i suppose i.

171
00:14:05,91 --> 00:14:11,70
I felt certain that the dominant
paradigm was a failure.

172
00:14:11,71 --> 00:14:15,66
And both for individual human
beings and for the planet.

173
00:14:17,16 --> 00:14:18,89
So i was confident that

174
00:14:18,89 --> 00:14:24,70
that what most people were doing
was not really helping either them

175
00:14:24,70 --> 00:14:29,90
or the planet but i thought what
we should do in the face of

176
00:14:29,90 --> 00:14:31,83
that problem.

177
00:14:31,85 --> 00:14:36,42
I wasn't too confident and i just went
along for the ride with a number of the.

178
00:14:38,06 --> 00:14:42,62
The things that became. Focal points.

179
00:14:43,35 --> 00:14:48,20
You know for for the new tribe. For years.

180
00:14:49,72 --> 00:14:52,12
So.

181
00:14:57,59 --> 00:14:59,26
I'm.

182
00:14:59,28 --> 00:15:04,45
I'm just as sure as i was then which i
suppose some people would say it's too short

183
00:15:04,45 --> 00:15:06,70
but i don't feel absolutely certain.

184
00:15:07,10 --> 00:15:10,39
But i'm certainly about i
am as sure as i was then

185
00:15:10,39 --> 00:15:15,67
that the way humans relate to each other.

186
00:15:17,41 --> 00:15:23,07
And the structures through which most
humans relate to each other in australia

187
00:15:23,07 --> 00:15:29,95
and indeed in the whole of the
western world are bad for

188
00:15:29,95 --> 00:15:35,72
humans and bad for the planet. Yes i'm
i'm i'm pretty sure that we were right.

189
00:15:36,08 --> 00:15:40,57
That most of the things that were
happening were wrong but i don't know

190
00:15:40,57 --> 00:15:45,89
that we've come up with any
particularly brilliant.

191
00:15:46,48 --> 00:15:53,41
Alternative structures. You know
we've had no impact on the media.

192
00:15:53,43 --> 00:15:59,06
We've had no impact on.

193
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,00
No chel ism.

194
00:16:02,28 --> 00:16:06,33
Consumerism while we've had a little bit
of an impact on those two things i guess

195
00:16:06,33 --> 00:16:11,62
as a local at a local level
we've had a i think.

196
00:16:12,52 --> 00:16:19,03
A leading role in alerting the planet
to the environmental consequences

197
00:16:20,71 --> 00:16:25,75
of western society.

198
00:16:25,77 --> 00:16:27,87
So there are things like that.

199
00:16:28,90 --> 00:16:32,68
Which i think very powerful
and very very important

200
00:16:33,88 --> 00:16:40,37
but apart from that
capacity to to turn around.

201
00:16:40,90 --> 00:16:45,41
I think a lot of people as far as the
environment is concerned there are not too

202
00:16:45,41 --> 00:16:46,00
many things

203
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:53,15
that we could say i have been
outstandingly successful in our.

204
00:16:53,17 --> 00:16:57,72
In changing this terrible slide

205
00:16:57,72 --> 00:16:59,47
that we're in both as individuals

206
00:16:59,47 --> 00:17:08,53
and of course as a planet.

207
00:17:10,44 --> 00:17:13,76
Oh no no.

208
00:17:13,78 --> 00:17:16,17
I'm a bit naive i suppose

209
00:17:16,17 --> 00:17:23,32
but i i wouldn't say we've
filed i would just see the.

210
00:17:23,33 --> 00:17:25,72
The problems.

211
00:17:26,74 --> 00:17:30,78
Of creating change to be.

212
00:17:31,45 --> 00:17:37,30
Well massive i mean. There are.

213
00:17:37,32 --> 00:17:39,60
In any particular system.

214
00:17:39,62 --> 00:17:43,71
There are feedback loops
invisible feedback loops

215
00:17:43,71 --> 00:17:46,53
that are operating to keep
things running the way they are.

216
00:17:48,24 --> 00:17:54,26
And to bring about some change
in the sort of structures

217
00:17:54,26 --> 00:17:59,85
that are dominating you know. Our
life at the moment i think is some.

218
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,52
That's that's simply beyond a small group
of people i mean i think we're going to

219
00:18:04,52 --> 00:18:05,97
need a lot of luck.

220
00:18:07,05 --> 00:18:11,26
Right now for for this terrible process

221
00:18:11,26 --> 00:18:16,83
that we're all engaged in to
distill right i don't see.

222
00:18:16,84 --> 00:18:18,07
I don't know what the media.

223
00:18:18,49 --> 00:18:23,05
What impact the media have on my life at
the moment but i suspect it's profound

224
00:18:23,05 --> 00:18:28,59
and yet i can't see any
why in the past 25 years

225
00:18:28,59 --> 00:18:32,81
that i've been a conscious create creature
and and interacting with the media.

226
00:18:32,93 --> 00:18:34,28
I can't see any way in which.

227
00:18:34,96 --> 00:18:38,74
I could either find out what
they're really doing to me.

228
00:18:40,18 --> 00:18:44,65
Or see how i could impact them
other than the way that i have.

229
00:18:44,67 --> 00:18:50,25
So i feel pretty powerless in the
face of the media and i think

230
00:18:50,25 --> 00:18:55,32
that the right word. I guess there
are forms of communication.

231
00:18:56,21 --> 00:19:01,23
I suppose i should say there
are just so pervasive

232
00:19:02,20 --> 00:19:05,72
and and at the same time.

233
00:19:05,74 --> 00:19:10,40
Undiscerning bull unable to be
teased out into vacant pain and

234
00:19:10,40 --> 00:19:14,57
that i feel pretty helpless so i don't
know that there's anything more

235
00:19:14,57 --> 00:19:20,08
that we as a tribe could
have done i mean other than.

236
00:19:20,10 --> 00:19:23,49
You know save the franklin
or save to rainier.

237
00:19:23,85 --> 00:19:29,06
Or. Stay here.

238
00:19:29,63 --> 00:19:35,03
Stay in a part of the.
Of australia which is.

239
00:19:35,78 --> 00:19:40,67
Visually. Very beautiful which is not.

240
00:19:41,59 --> 00:19:48,67
A city because i don't think cities
are good places for humans to grow.

241
00:19:48,69 --> 00:19:53,65
So we've successfully made
a urban rural migration

242
00:19:54,49 --> 00:19:59,94
and stuck around and become
useful and to some it.

243
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,67
Then an accepted part of that other tribe.

244
00:20:05,08 --> 00:20:08,98
And now i think we've done about
as well as we could hope to do.

245
00:20:09,08 --> 00:20:14,87
I don't see how else or how more
profoundly we could have impacted.

246
00:20:15,44 --> 00:20:21,43
Either locally the local
scene or the national scene.

247
00:20:21,45 --> 00:20:27,62
Do you think. Generations.

248
00:20:28,97 --> 00:20:34,70
You know you know. Retiring.

249
00:20:35,50 --> 00:20:39,42
Just go.

250
00:20:39,44 --> 00:20:46,14
Well there's not a there's not
a large migration back to the

251
00:20:46,14 --> 00:20:50,80
cities. So the essence of making a.

252
00:20:50,82 --> 00:20:56,39
Of rejecting living in
cities remains with us.

253
00:20:56,48 --> 00:20:58,46
So i no i don't think we are giving up.

254
00:20:58,49 --> 00:21:02,96
I mean of course a lot of the things

255
00:21:02,97 --> 00:21:08,21
that we are earlier on might
have identified as crucial to.

256
00:21:08,23 --> 00:21:12,62
You know being in the counterculture
like having schooling our own kids

257
00:21:13,94 --> 00:21:17,89
and those sorts of things.
Many of those ideals.

258
00:21:19,09 --> 00:21:25,55
Many of us have dropped many of those
ideals but some of us still have them but.

259
00:21:27,10 --> 00:21:33,83
I will always identify myself
with this tribe as long as i

260
00:21:33,84 --> 00:21:40,52
can go to events where i meet
the people that i've now known

261
00:21:40,52 --> 00:21:44,79
and loved for 20 years and where
we thing and then together

262
00:21:44,79 --> 00:21:45,87
and smoke a bit of dope

263
00:21:45,87 --> 00:21:52,09
and those sorts of things which i feel
i'm most fortunate to be able to do

264
00:21:52,79 --> 00:21:58,10
most people middle class people
in a fairly upwardly mobile

265
00:21:59,71 --> 00:22:06,03
sort of. Social situation have to travel
and move and make career moves and.

266
00:22:07,09 --> 00:22:11,54
And i don't think that they can remain.

267
00:22:12,41 --> 00:22:18,38
Usually a part of a tribe the way i've
been able to remain a part of the tribe so

268
00:22:19,30 --> 00:22:26,08
for me growing old with this
bunch of people is just an

269
00:22:26,08 --> 00:22:26,98
absolute treasure.

270
00:22:28,24 --> 00:22:32,63
So i'll never seem like a failure to me as
long as we all gather even if it's only

271
00:22:32,63 --> 00:22:36,70
three or four times a
year at various events.

272
00:22:36,72 --> 00:22:41,99
But it certainly that's still happening
with a nuff frequency for me to feel

273
00:22:41,99 --> 00:22:46,67
totally identified still
with the movement.

274
00:22:46,68 --> 00:22:52,64
That was.

275
00:22:56,42 --> 00:23:01,95
Well we. We wanted to live.

276
00:23:04,08 --> 00:23:09,83
As closely intertwined with each other's
lives as we could we really did feel.

277
00:23:10,97 --> 00:23:15,05
Yeah. Ok.

278
00:23:16,87 --> 00:23:21,22
Well when we set up paradise
valley pastoral company.

279
00:23:21,24 --> 00:23:27,26
We in our naivete i
guess we really dreamed

280
00:23:27,26 --> 00:23:28,89
that we would all grow old together there.

281
00:23:29,96 --> 00:23:32,76
That was the dream but rather
than being mum and dad

282
00:23:32,76 --> 00:23:37,65
and the kids moving about the country
because of various people's occupations

283
00:23:37,65 --> 00:23:38,92
and getting together with our brothers

284
00:23:38,92 --> 00:23:44,72
and sisters at christmas time we would
stay together and live together

285
00:23:45,47 --> 00:23:48,97
and work together as much as we
could and grow old together.

286
00:23:48,99 --> 00:23:52,29
It was an absolutely beautiful
dream so we would eat together.

287
00:23:52,92 --> 00:23:54,51
And we would buy together.

288
00:23:54,78 --> 00:23:59,06
And although we'd have separate bedrooms
and those sorts of things by and large.

289
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,15
Our living time would be with each other.

290
00:24:04,63 --> 00:24:09,80
As a small hamlet of people
rather than mom and dad

291
00:24:09,80 --> 00:24:14,73
and the kids the sharing
of the money that we are

292
00:24:14,73 --> 00:24:17,65
and was of course not possible.

293
00:24:19,66 --> 00:24:22,34
There was really no way of.

294
00:24:23,20 --> 00:24:26,25
Of exchanging money for sweat

295
00:24:27,93 --> 00:24:32,59
and although in the beginning you know
i put in a lot more money than sweat

296
00:24:32,59 --> 00:24:35,85
and other people put in a
lot more sweat than money.

297
00:24:37,71 --> 00:24:44,71
In the long run it was very difficult for
us to try to balance those things out

298
00:24:45,98 --> 00:24:51,61
and we shared less

299
00:24:51,61 --> 00:24:52,77
and less money

300
00:24:52,78 --> 00:24:59,21
and sweat as time went by it was
just not possible for us to

301
00:25:01,17 --> 00:25:04,85
to do that dream.

302
00:25:04,86 --> 00:25:09,19
And we shared less of each other's.

303
00:25:09,96 --> 00:25:15,19
Commune all lives too as time went by so
gradually somebody will build a little

304
00:25:15,19 --> 00:25:19,30
kitchen or somebody would
build a little living room.

305
00:25:19,82 --> 00:25:23,33
So instead of having bedrooms
and everything else be shared.

306
00:25:23,37 --> 00:25:28,47
Sometimes one family would eat on their
own or one couple would eat on their own.

307
00:25:29,86 --> 00:25:33,35
And so commune or life.

308
00:25:33,76 --> 00:25:38,89
Gradually changed into village life

309
00:25:40,27 --> 00:25:45,95
and in the end that's what paradise valley
is it's now a village rather than a

310
00:25:45,95 --> 00:25:48,15
commune. But the mere fact

311
00:25:48,15 --> 00:25:54,65
that 20 to 30 people can actually
share the ownership of land

312
00:25:56,10 --> 00:25:59,95
is not a bad feet and in the.

313
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,21
Even the spend what commune
or money there is on roads

314
00:26:05,21 --> 00:26:09,45
and basic facilities.
Is still working there.

315
00:26:10,94 --> 00:26:17,48
What paradise valley didn't have
all along was some deep spiritual

316
00:26:19,05 --> 00:26:23,29
connection. And a spiritual
connectedness between all the members.

317
00:26:24,68 --> 00:26:25,84
Whereas one

318
00:26:25,84 --> 00:26:29,64
or two of the other communities because
paradise valley was one of the first six

319
00:26:30,38 --> 00:26:33,50
two of the other six
dhammananda and body farm.

320
00:26:33,99 --> 00:26:38,45
Did have a deep sort of spiritual
commitment and i felt for a while as if

321
00:26:38,45 --> 00:26:44,35
that was going to maybe hold them
in a more commune all style of life

322
00:26:44,35 --> 00:26:47,04
and paradise valley but in the event.

323
00:26:47,06 --> 00:26:51,88
All of those multiple occupancies
have now become multiple occupancies

324
00:26:51,88 --> 00:26:55,22
and they're rather. Villages
rather than anything

325
00:26:55,22 --> 00:26:59,56
that people would usually understand
when they talk about a commune.

326
00:27:00,08 --> 00:27:06,12
They just villagers of friends of like
minded friends with fairly similar ideals

327
00:27:06,99 --> 00:27:12,01
who have a capacity to exchange sweat but.

328
00:27:12,82 --> 00:27:18,84
The exchange of money for sweat
has still. I think defeated.

329
00:27:19,24 --> 00:27:20,17
Most of us

330
00:27:21,41 --> 00:27:28,85
when we've tried to do it.

331
00:27:30,53 --> 00:27:35,35
Oh well i suppose it's it's
almost just total logical to say

332
00:27:35,35 --> 00:27:40,50
that we couldn't overcome
our conditioning.

333
00:27:40,52 --> 00:27:47,52
You know i i was hurting plenty
of money so i could pay some

334
00:27:47,53 --> 00:27:52,43
of the people to do some
work for me and for us.

335
00:27:53,94 --> 00:27:59,16
At quite a reasonable right. Per hour.

336
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:06,10
But there was no way i could pay for
somebody else to do something for me

337
00:28:06,10 --> 00:28:08,99
or for the farm at the same hourly rate

338
00:28:08,99 --> 00:28:14,19
that i was getting because the hourly rate
i was getting as a doctor was absolutely

339
00:28:14,19 --> 00:28:19,86
extraordinary. And i certainly
didn't feel like paying the right

340
00:28:19,86 --> 00:28:24,82
that i was getting. For
they are the labor.

341
00:28:24,83 --> 00:28:29,09
It's possible that if i'd felt like
doing that it might have worked out

342
00:28:29,80 --> 00:28:31,45
but i didn't feel like doing that

343
00:28:31,45 --> 00:28:34,35
and the amount of money involved
would have been extraordinary.

344
00:28:34,67 --> 00:28:36,51
It would have looked
and felt quite bizarre

345
00:28:36,51 --> 00:28:39,57
but doing it any other way in the
long run didn't work either.

346
00:28:39,98 --> 00:28:41,97
So in the end we couldn't do

347
00:28:41,97 --> 00:28:46,79
that sort of exchange i couldn't put
money into the community purse.

348
00:28:47,09 --> 00:28:51,74
Instead of working for
a day etc. Etc. Etc.

349
00:28:51,74 --> 00:28:53,23
Just didn't work out like

350
00:28:53,23 --> 00:29:05,49
that.

351
00:29:05,50 --> 00:29:08,48
I think i did i did a
pretty good job of that.

352
00:29:11,10 --> 00:29:16,73
I i worked i didn't work in nimbin
basically i worked in lismore

353
00:29:19,44 --> 00:29:24,32
here. Well.

354
00:29:25,37 --> 00:29:30,28
The fact that i was a psychiatrist and
indeed the only to carter for miles around.

355
00:29:32,35 --> 00:29:37,15
Somehow or other didn't have i don't
think it impacted greatly on my life

356
00:29:37,15 --> 00:29:41,48
and i don't think it impacted terribly
importantly on the community.

357
00:29:42,28 --> 00:29:42,86
Except

358
00:29:42,86 --> 00:29:49,51
that i grew to have a close
friendship with the local

359
00:29:49,51 --> 00:29:53,07
policeman. Which might in the event.

360
00:29:53,45 --> 00:29:59,94
I think of been quite helpful and early
in the piece. His capacity to top.

361
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:01,69
All right. Deviants.

362
00:30:02,50 --> 00:30:07,05
I think was increased to
some extent by the fact

363
00:30:07,05 --> 00:30:09,38
that he knew i was a
reasonable bloke he knew

364
00:30:09,38 --> 00:30:15,70
that i worked in the context of my working
in the local city lismore i was a

365
00:30:15,70 --> 00:30:20,02
respected and ordinary
well known all around.

366
00:30:20,19 --> 00:30:23,01
I was a consultant i was a
specialist working in town.

367
00:30:23,32 --> 00:30:27,06
So i was one of the sort of senior
doctors in there and even though.

368
00:30:27,50 --> 00:30:31,79
You know like superman i changed into my
hippy gear once i got back to nimbin.

369
00:30:32,92 --> 00:30:38,00
I think the the relationship that
i therefore had with that guy.

370
00:30:38,02 --> 00:30:44,85
I think was quite helpful in his capacity
to tolerate the nsa not to try to police

371
00:30:45,76 --> 00:30:49,97
the area. The way he otherwise might have.

372
00:30:49,99 --> 00:30:51,72
And so i think

373
00:30:51,72 --> 00:30:59,08
that would be probably the the main
way in which i as a psychiatrist.

374
00:30:59,10 --> 00:31:04,21
Had some sort of influence on the
place it was an indirect way by.

375
00:31:04,23 --> 00:31:06,86
In a sense giving the
policeman permission.

376
00:31:07,24 --> 00:31:11,05
You know not to get his knickers in
a knot about this weird situation.

377
00:31:11,40 --> 00:31:13,29
That was happening there

378
00:31:13,29 --> 00:31:17,50
and of course he would have now not i
smoked dope too which would have helped.

379
00:31:18,66 --> 00:31:22,48
I think in him not becoming
obsessed about about

380
00:31:22,49 --> 00:31:28,70
that part of the whole process as well as
far as the community were concerned you

381
00:31:28,71 --> 00:31:33,82
know the rest of the tribal concerned they
certainly didn't use me as any sort of

382
00:31:33,82 --> 00:31:34,50
counsellor

383
00:31:34,50 --> 00:31:42,15
or regard me as having any
particular wisdom because.
