1
00:00:07,05 --> 00:00:12,79
Yes i you know we have a son and he
lives in lismore and it really is.

2
00:00:12,92 --> 00:00:16,22
He's not really interested
in this experiment at all.

3
00:00:16,28 --> 00:00:18,61
He came here when he was 16

4
00:00:18,61 --> 00:00:25,60
and he was too young to see any real
benefit in it in too old to be to be my to

5
00:00:25,60 --> 00:00:27,08
be formed by yes.

6
00:00:28,48 --> 00:00:35,33
However my oldest daughter the first time
she visited us we were living in a tent

7
00:00:35,33 --> 00:00:36,12
and she came here

8
00:00:36,12 --> 00:00:39,42
and it was just a bare paddock he was
no trees there wasn't a tree from

9
00:00:39,42 --> 00:00:42,22
that into this and you know
there's no trees at all

10
00:00:43,91 --> 00:00:47,56
and she said she's told me years
later i wonder what are the mum

11
00:00:47,56 --> 00:00:49,36
and dad going to do here you know.

12
00:00:50,56 --> 00:00:54,35
However a few years after
she came to live here

13
00:00:54,35 --> 00:01:01,30
and as nice with our family
a quiet time with naming

14
00:01:01,30 --> 00:01:03,49
but two family houses here.

15
00:01:04,47 --> 00:01:07,20
There's no reason at all if
our son ever wanted to come

16
00:01:07,20 --> 00:01:11,45
and build a cabin on either of those
blocks inland. So that's good.

17
00:01:14,20 --> 00:01:19,27
It's been an experience
for me it's probably been

18
00:01:21,55 --> 00:01:24,05
a dumb many things in my
life in a jazz musician.

19
00:01:26,06 --> 00:01:28,28
I've been a seaman lies a hole

20
00:01:28,28 --> 00:01:34,76
or sorts of things you know i think
this is given me more interest

21
00:01:35,94 --> 00:01:39,81
than possibly any other thing in
my life watching this developing

22
00:01:41,31 --> 00:01:47,79
and helping over you know it's been
a very rewarding sort of experience

23
00:01:48,60 --> 00:01:52,09
and to see the village now just expanding.

24
00:01:52,14 --> 00:01:56,25
I know that building down there
is going to create activity

25
00:01:56,25 --> 00:01:59,94
and i know what happens
when the pool got some.

26
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,21
Long as if the dream of

27
00:02:03,21 --> 00:02:07,97
that expansion with.

28
00:02:09,05 --> 00:02:12,84
All the right sort of
ideal stays with it then

29
00:02:12,84 --> 00:02:19,73
and i'm sure it will be from

30
00:02:19,74 --> 00:02:22,39
the billing truth

31
00:02:22,39 --> 00:02:29,32
or it was an economic experiment not
something in the best sense it was an

32
00:02:29,32 --> 00:02:36,08
experiment in people's hearts.
Everybody participated and so.

33
00:02:37,05 --> 00:02:41,70
I feel i do regard this as
a major change in my life.

34
00:02:41,74 --> 00:02:45,73
Elvis got an enormous benefit
of also pulled my hair.

35
00:02:45,81 --> 00:02:48,38
I'd know and then i wondered
why i was doing all this stuff

36
00:02:48,38 --> 00:02:53,90
but a major change in careers from

37
00:02:56,18 --> 00:02:59,38
someone who was climbing the corporate
and similar government later

38
00:03:00,43 --> 00:03:03,44
and having to give up on that path
actually started from nothing.

39
00:03:05,20 --> 00:03:08,68
Being a free consultant
to the whole village

40
00:03:08,68 --> 00:03:12,29
and it was many needs from filling out
forms to getting homeowners grants to

41
00:03:12,29 --> 00:03:13,78
dealing with councils and so on.

42
00:03:13,91 --> 00:03:16,47
And those but the benefits of

43
00:03:16,47 --> 00:03:23,33
that is to give you an example one i've
started to go overseas consultancy work in

44
00:03:23,33 --> 00:03:23,87
86

45
00:03:25,45 --> 00:03:30,53
and i've been invited to seychelles botswana
india working a sensually with communities

46
00:03:30,53 --> 00:03:34,52
which have the same legal structures
we have multiple occupancy is all

47
00:03:34,52 --> 00:03:42,04
and some cases of course the government
department to do with structures so.

48
00:03:42,76 --> 00:03:49,72
Changing a a lot of thought into realities
where i know exporting the very

49
00:03:49,72 --> 00:03:51,85
solar systems we developed
here out of poverty.

50
00:03:52,18 --> 00:03:56,60
This whole place is to first
sold our village in australia.

51
00:03:56,68 --> 00:03:59,94
It was built not by government
brains. It was built.

52
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,91
By poverty people couldn't
afford anything else.

53
00:04:02,20 --> 00:04:03,86
And now we're exporting that knowledge

54
00:04:05,29 --> 00:04:08,10
and i see it as a as a
major growth industry.

55
00:04:08,91 --> 00:04:13,51
So i could say at the end of 10 years
professionally as well as emotionally i've

56
00:04:13,51 --> 00:04:18,77
gained a lot. I don't think i can recommend
a therapy i really believe that.

57
00:04:19,21 --> 00:04:25,25
It's it has a deficit as well
but certainly made me healthier

58
00:04:25,25 --> 00:04:30,78
and stronger than i would
have been in the city. And.

59
00:04:30,80 --> 00:04:34,68
In terms of family life
couldn't have been better

60
00:04:34,68 --> 00:04:39,21
but i gotta tell you there's a lot of
difference between living in a flat with the

61
00:04:39,21 --> 00:04:43,08
neighbors yelling on saturday
nights and ambulances going by

62
00:04:43,08 --> 00:04:47,99
and sounds to them everywhere and sitting
in your own god given nature reserve

63
00:04:47,99 --> 00:04:50,73
and nothing but kookaburras and
wallabies going around and.

64
00:04:51,41 --> 00:04:55,05
And you're a thing of course
nurturing friendships and in

65
00:04:55,05 --> 00:04:57,52
that ten years before it
came to bill and cliff.

66
00:04:57,79 --> 00:05:03,06
I didn't make one strong friends i had
acquaintances. I exchanged ideas.

67
00:05:03,52 --> 00:05:09,80
I never lost my heart over anybody living
here for 10 years are developed beautiful

68
00:05:09,81 --> 00:05:15,17
friendships of a level. I don't
think was possible really.

69
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:19,78
And so that has been a whole.

70
00:05:19,79 --> 00:05:25,00
Really nice benefit if you i think you
know what a community means you know the

71
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:27,02
person that it's a silence quiet person

72
00:05:27,02 --> 00:05:30,75
that speaks only seldom you know
once you can buy a lie on it.

73
00:05:30,81 --> 00:05:34,33
I want to you can go into a oh it's a
wonderful feeling to rest we have a feeling

74
00:05:34,33 --> 00:05:35,74
of belonging to a village.

75
00:05:36,16 --> 00:05:40,35
I think one of the recent well not
absolutely recent but only two

76
00:05:40,35 --> 00:05:46,89
or three years duration members said
to me one day said the most beautiful

77
00:05:46,90 --> 00:05:48,44
thing in my life.

78
00:05:49,29 --> 00:05:54,74
Is being allowed to be here and to
take in the growth of the city.

79
00:05:55,92 --> 00:05:59,93
I know it is great and
i think that's been.

80
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:05,45
Only the reward for you to see
it happen as an economist

81
00:06:05,45 --> 00:06:09,01
that almost put in the quaids into it
because there is a direct relationship

82
00:06:10,16 --> 00:06:11,67
between work.

83
00:06:12,09 --> 00:06:18,77
Non paid for which is absurd in in
society unless you're a volunteer

84
00:06:18,77 --> 00:06:22,44
worker here at your whole economies
based on that unpaid work

85
00:06:22,44 --> 00:06:25,42
and the payment for that
is in emotional wealth

86
00:06:25,42 --> 00:06:29,61
and which is used because you don't do it
for yourself you do it for the community

87
00:06:30,45 --> 00:06:31,81
and somehow it goes back to you.

88
00:06:31,90 --> 00:06:33,77
And it flows around and it's something

89
00:06:33,77 --> 00:06:38,37
that conventional economists of the
rationalist kind do not recognize.

90
00:06:38,64 --> 00:06:41,00
You're doing this and
somebody else is doing that.

91
00:06:41,17 --> 00:06:45,43
There is always looks like it's
a it's a movement of of reality

92
00:06:45,43 --> 00:06:50,90
that in conventional economics is not
being measured it always has to be judy p

93
00:06:50,90 --> 00:06:54,39
and out putin growth and so on. So what
we're talking about a different thing.

94
00:06:54,40 --> 00:06:55,31
It's all about people

95
00:06:55,31 --> 00:06:59,72
and they're talking about recycling
some shitty economic system

96
00:06:59,72 --> 00:07:02,22
and we're talking about recycling people.

97
00:07:02,34 --> 00:07:08,58
I give you a key example of what just
how how sound the new economics is a

98
00:07:08,59 --> 00:07:09,51
definition of wealth.

99
00:07:10,38 --> 00:07:13,88
Now you go to any conventional
economist any government economist

100
00:07:13,88 --> 00:07:19,57
and wealth will be defined as
assets and income and self wrong.

101
00:07:19,71 --> 00:07:24,86
Totally completely wrong. It only defines
have to energy. There are single time.

102
00:07:25,95 --> 00:07:29,87
Now if i can make $100 a day in one second

103
00:07:29,87 --> 00:07:32,57
and have the rest of the day
to listen to the summer birds.

104
00:07:32,78 --> 00:07:36,04
I must by definition be wealthier than the
guy who does the same hundred dollars

105
00:07:36,04 --> 00:07:37,49
and say twenty four hours.

106
00:07:38,32 --> 00:07:45,19
So time is a real essence of of of
of of wealth in this economy here.

107
00:07:46,33 --> 00:07:49,31
And of course you can i do it in our
salacious we are part of a system.

108
00:07:49,59 --> 00:07:52,78
But here we recognize those
hidden parts of the system

109
00:07:52,78 --> 00:07:57,79
and want to things we've lost over the years
right throughout the world is we have

110
00:07:57,79 --> 00:07:59,21
given are.

111
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,94
Our neighborhood sense our sense of
community progressively over to higher

112
00:08:05,94 --> 00:08:08,07
and higher authorities
first from the church

113
00:08:08,07 --> 00:08:11,16
and psychiatrist to state government
federal government united nations

114
00:08:11,16 --> 00:08:12,95
and ends of death and nothing wrong with

115
00:08:12,95 --> 00:08:15,54
that cause we need strong
central decision making.

116
00:08:15,54 --> 00:08:18,70
Obviously but we shouldn't
lose that sense of community

117
00:08:19,48 --> 00:08:24,51
and that's how you clench your trees but
telling your kids if you plant that tree.

118
00:08:24,54 --> 00:08:29,17
We look up to you you'll be a good
boy you know and he does it for free

119
00:08:29,17 --> 00:08:31,82
and you get an emotional
charge and love out of it

120
00:08:31,82 --> 00:08:38,75
and i found the same thing here using
years of getting myself in a canonic side

121
00:08:38,75 --> 00:08:42,38
into deeper and deeper financial
trouble but in to be economic stress

122
00:08:42,38 --> 00:08:47,90
and live like a king and
that it. Yes definitely.

123
00:08:48,17 --> 00:08:49,88
Stent of living for this quality of life.

124
00:08:50,13 --> 00:08:53,49
We have to move away from
originally defined set

125
00:08:54,48 --> 00:08:59,83
that can see people in so-called third
world countries being defined as being on

126
00:08:59,83 --> 00:09:04,15
the bottom of the poverty line yet they've
got a house the got an orchard to got

127
00:09:04,15 --> 00:09:06,39
clean. They've got a wonderful.

128
00:09:06,40 --> 00:09:09,29
Into a relationship but they
don't have the seedy players.

129
00:09:09,36 --> 00:09:10,50
Therefore they're poor

130
00:09:12,05 --> 00:09:15,51
or they don't have a wage packet because
they work in the field definite poor it's

131
00:09:15,51 --> 00:09:21,54
a nonsense. If i would be a radical
revolutionary but sometimes i wish i was.

132
00:09:22,88 --> 00:09:28,87
I would i would really i would transform
the whole the whole nonsense of economics.

133
00:09:28,89 --> 00:09:31,87
I would rip the guts out of
economics teaching at universities

134
00:09:32,61 --> 00:09:33,60
and i would actually make income

135
00:09:33,60 --> 00:09:40,19
that you know london school of economics
is done more to create the problems the

136
00:09:40,19 --> 00:09:42,91
world suffering from now
than any other institution.

137
00:09:43,47 --> 00:09:48,93
John i went to the holland school of
economics which is just like the longest

138
00:09:48,94 --> 00:09:54,83
around a top school and my school president
who was now seven years old from

139
00:09:54,83 --> 00:09:59,80
that time and we write regularly.
We discussed he sings how our.

140
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,56
And tyre profession has sold out to the
dollar how greed is the operative word of

141
00:10:05,56 --> 00:10:06,38
the entire system.

142
00:10:06,75 --> 00:10:13,26
I mean this is to man who educated
30 years of of european leadership

143
00:10:13,26 --> 00:10:17,77
in business messages saying the system
doesn't work we all know it isn't work.

144
00:10:19,04 --> 00:10:24,43
So what we could have to do is we're going
to have to empower the lifestyle i would

145
00:10:24,43 --> 00:10:27,36
like to see the amp arm and
falling to do a firing.

146
00:10:28,18 --> 00:10:30,93
I'd like the people to wake up at
night and a tape of the morning

147
00:10:30,93 --> 00:10:34,24
and ask them what would you like to do
they take like to plant a tree allowed to

148
00:10:34,24 --> 00:10:38,63
grow my own fruit. You know not a dense
in there saying i wanted new c.d.

149
00:10:38,63 --> 00:10:44,27
Players you know you don't
need us where we want to slide

150
00:10:45,12 --> 00:10:47,78
society generally all across
the face of the earth.

151
00:10:47,79 --> 00:10:52,84
I feel is on a very slippery
slide in the hurtling down

152
00:10:52,84 --> 00:10:58,36
or you know other levers like a horse ride
you've lost the reins your feet are out

153
00:10:58,36 --> 00:11:00,68
of the stirrups you
galloping headlong down.

154
00:11:02,49 --> 00:11:02,84
I think

155
00:11:04,40 --> 00:11:11,38
when we get to the bottom of whatever
this steep slope athens to be i

156
00:11:11,39 --> 00:11:18,01
think places like selim cliffs will be there
for the reconstruction. It would seem.

157
00:11:18,13 --> 00:11:21,60
We are going from strength to strength
as to system as having a haven't heard a

158
00:11:21,60 --> 00:11:22,67
turret it seems

159
00:11:22,67 --> 00:11:28,73
that way because we made this particular
place may not survive because it could if

160
00:11:28,73 --> 00:11:32,60
that crunch comes this could be just over
iran. You know we could all be dead.

161
00:11:32,80 --> 00:11:37,61
You know there knows that it's places
like this that will survive where.

162
00:11:38,16 --> 00:11:41,90
The soil has been chewed
and food will grow.

163
00:11:42,05 --> 00:11:48,86
It's not easy to grow food in here
without chemicals and how hard work.

164
00:11:48,86 --> 00:11:53,78
How can it be easy when you do land as
been ruined. Yet when you teach your kids.

165
00:11:53,92 --> 00:11:55,73
No indigenous language.

166
00:11:56,04 --> 00:11:59,43
You don't tempt me into the
indigenous knowledge of plant life.

167
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,57
The take land is a likely change you know
you're not you're not taking your kids

168
00:12:03,57 --> 00:12:08,85
out to naturally show them how to plant
food i mean this should be standard theme

169
00:12:08,85 --> 00:12:13,02
in the curriculum sure they should
either they should absolutely.

170
00:12:13,50 --> 00:12:13,85
Without

171
00:12:13,85 --> 00:12:19,39
that you're not going to you know i remember
talking to old english guy here today.

172
00:12:19,56 --> 00:12:25,28
Steven lisa came here was all he was
guys my age and a jazz fan you know

173
00:12:25,28 --> 00:12:31,51
and we were brought up within probably
so you miles of each other was we had.

174
00:12:33,00 --> 00:12:36,03
However how much more do you want and.

175
00:12:36,21 --> 00:12:40,59
I'm happy i want to say one thing i have
a chance you might say it while you're

176
00:12:40,59 --> 00:12:47,14
thinking of it you know when i hear john
talking about the system collapsing

177
00:12:47,14 --> 00:12:49,55
and it's a reality in our minds

178
00:12:49,55 --> 00:12:53,22
that it could happen certainly
do the indicators under a good.

179
00:12:55,73 --> 00:13:01,63
I sometimes wish that. We'd have more
government cooperation that are good really.

180
00:13:03,07 --> 00:13:07,46
I'd like to work for a government some
time to really work to to actually.

181
00:13:08,30 --> 00:13:13,75
Do these things on a large scale i mean you
can spend 10 years of your life proving

182
00:13:13,75 --> 00:13:16,34
something that everybody knows
what you did to get healthier

183
00:13:16,34 --> 00:13:21,07
when you plant your own garden. You can
get a happier if you have good friends.

184
00:13:21,08 --> 00:13:24,01
That's now that's not to take
this incredible discovery.

185
00:13:24,67 --> 00:13:30,53
Into canberra and that is actually saying
that. Let's do it. Nifty let's do it.

186
00:13:30,65 --> 00:13:34,87
Get away nifty let's take
these people and that's

187
00:13:34,87 --> 00:13:39,42
and let's give them something you can
do is heaps of land which is misused

188
00:13:40,56 --> 00:13:41,97
that can be. Anybody

189
00:13:41,97 --> 00:13:47,82
that can be broadly bottom in your book in
your book he was to say something to yes

190
00:13:47,82 --> 00:13:53,92
what you would have to waste on the
drag a bunch of flies around with him.

191
00:13:53,93 --> 00:13:59,69
If you're going to ask you a question.
Reversed so we can say when we think that.

192
00:14:01,74 --> 00:14:05,10
What strikes you as the main thing
you're outside you can see thunderbird

193
00:14:05,10 --> 00:14:10,12
and we can hear about a billion.

194
00:14:12,36 --> 00:14:18,39
Things and we go. You
know in the center of.

195
00:14:18,41 --> 00:14:24,37
God this is happening and the difference.

196
00:14:24,39 --> 00:14:31,20
Is that. I would say oh no no no no.

197
00:14:31,22 --> 00:14:37,38
Working you know and way and people here.

198
00:14:37,40 --> 00:14:44,04
Yeah it was probably you know yet
until it is very complicated.

199
00:14:44,06 --> 00:14:49,31
It's the father of us all on the
moderators all assets i thought of all.

200
00:14:49,33 --> 00:14:52,35
Dhammananda boaties they're really nice.

201
00:14:53,50 --> 00:14:57,99
You know they're really nice but
it is that the religious trip.

202
00:14:58,59 --> 00:14:59,68
You know you couldn't do

203
00:14:59,68 --> 00:15:04,85
that bodie trip with a hundred fifteen
people like we did here we had a guy.

204
00:15:05,27 --> 00:15:10,18
In our living body farm after 10 years
living here didn't get anything for his

205
00:15:10,18 --> 00:15:13,10
house because he belongs to the
commune and effort can start again.

206
00:15:13,11 --> 00:15:17,89
It's very difficult to do that. It's an
unrealistic model as a monastery right.

207
00:15:18,07 --> 00:15:22,54
Yes or a religious retreat. Right. And
there we need those places and we do.

208
00:15:23,51 --> 00:15:28,97
But as a model for the massive
resettlement that's got to take place.

209
00:15:30,56 --> 00:15:35,67
It doesn't work. I think. Some of them.

210
00:15:36,69 --> 00:15:40,05
Because of the structure
because we can't get around

211
00:15:40,05 --> 00:15:44,40
that there's no trial no
we are not tribal people.

212
00:15:44,98 --> 00:15:49,64
And we cannot be no matter how much we
would all like to be and we are not.

213
00:15:49,83 --> 00:15:54,23
That's why we call our meeting our residents
meeting time to mull cause there's a

214
00:15:54,23 --> 00:15:59,27
tribal me as you say we understand.

215
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,52
That tribalism is for tribal people

216
00:16:04,96 --> 00:16:08,94
and even they are having trouble
living tribally nowadays.

217
00:16:10,24 --> 00:16:12,96
So this is there are going to be others.

218
00:16:13,06 --> 00:16:17,19
There are going to be others that will
come along which will be different.

219
00:16:17,48 --> 00:16:22,59
I see it happening in the suburbs i
really do not see what would stop

220
00:16:24,89 --> 00:16:28,65
well-directed government programs
into the suburbs into the small towns

221
00:16:29,50 --> 00:16:33,67
that in essence are taking unemployed
people and supporting modest

222
00:16:33,67 --> 00:16:36,73
and certain pensions like that and
make them contribute to society.

223
00:16:37,17 --> 00:16:41,82
I really believe after 10 years of living
here in what some people describe as a

224
00:16:41,82 --> 00:16:42,92
social security heaven.

225
00:16:43,11 --> 00:16:48,38
I find so security system
undermining more than it does good.

226
00:16:48,57 --> 00:16:50,65
I'm not saying you can just
change it and take it away.

227
00:16:50,97 --> 00:16:54,63
That is not another thing i'm saying you
should direct it in a more meaningful way

228
00:16:54,63 --> 00:16:59,95
more than saying to mr. a here's your
money do as you please you are free

229
00:16:59,95 --> 00:17:02,08
individual that is your bread.

230
00:17:02,22 --> 00:17:06,53
You can drink it you can gamble it you can
do what you want to that's for you to

231
00:17:06,53 --> 00:17:10,43
live on what it misses again to
a part of the of the equation

232
00:17:11,33 --> 00:17:15,93
that money must flow back into society and
therefore i think it should come tied.

233
00:17:15,99 --> 00:17:20,97
If you live in a community your brief the
same area walk on the sidewalks you you

234
00:17:20,97 --> 00:17:21,98
get the protection

235
00:17:21,98 --> 00:17:26,22
and if any is of a deaf we should contribute
to it you know those little schemes.

236
00:17:26,37 --> 00:17:31,51
There are some around where zoe lived in
red hill in brisbane opposite there was

237
00:17:31,51 --> 00:17:35,60
six hours and they were
owned by a co-operative

238
00:17:35,60 --> 00:17:38,89
and then you got it for a
very small amount of money

239
00:17:40,19 --> 00:17:45,67
but you didn't you never owned it.
Like if you left that was so later.

240
00:17:45,73 --> 00:17:46,90
I mean that it is rent.

241
00:17:47,35 --> 00:17:49,00
And you know behind

242
00:17:49,00 --> 00:17:52,69
that they've got a permaculture
garden a massive permaculture garden

243
00:17:52,69 --> 00:17:57,32
and went right down the back of the whole
of the six houses there are virtually

244
00:17:57,32 --> 00:17:59,95
food free you know you know a piece of it.

245
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,88
It can be done as can be done
but i believe what is required.

246
00:18:03,26 --> 00:18:08,41
Now is a government takes a monument to
manchester step and the price seedy e.p.

247
00:18:08,41 --> 00:18:10,54
Which is commune develop
an employment problem.

248
00:18:10,71 --> 00:18:14,18
To the dole to the dole not
as an exclusive measure.

249
00:18:14,46 --> 00:18:15,89
Now as a new measure

250
00:18:15,89 --> 00:18:20,19
that you are allowed to settle a bit of
land where you don't get away the rattly

251
00:18:20,19 --> 00:18:25,05
your residents get it and that has a
management structure like we've got here

252
00:18:25,05 --> 00:18:26,46
and it says ok. You get your money

253
00:18:26,46 --> 00:18:29,56
but you are 40 hours a week
doing office work to do in

254
00:18:29,56 --> 00:18:32,05
that you create employment on the
spot to the money is there already.

255
00:18:33,08 --> 00:18:36,70
It's a nonsense to ask someone here saying
go look for a job because right no job

256
00:18:36,70 --> 00:18:39,23
and 500 miles. Even if you try

257
00:18:39,23 --> 00:18:43,96
and if you did there would be five thousand
people the fun of it will be so what

258
00:18:43,96 --> 00:18:49,04
you should do is saying as john said earlier
the system doesn't recognise the real

259
00:18:49,04 --> 00:18:51,88
work. Therefore that the
money flow into the village.

260
00:18:52,10 --> 00:18:57,10
Therefore let the village to employ
people as artists as guests people a spot

261
00:18:57,10 --> 00:18:58,21
hollers or whatever you have

262
00:18:59,40 --> 00:19:05,89
and then you have a locally based economy
same money same exercise city picos 20

263
00:19:05,89 --> 00:19:08,90
per cent more than the door cost
it's a very wise investment.

264
00:19:08,93 --> 00:19:12,85
It would change the landscape of
australia overnight in terms of people's

265
00:19:12,85 --> 00:19:14,53
perception of how to take on the future.

266
00:19:15,31 --> 00:19:18,82
I think the biggest problem i
have today is that i don't see

267
00:19:18,82 --> 00:19:21,80
that sense to deserve a sense
we haven't this discussion.

268
00:19:21,84 --> 00:19:24,15
I don't see that reflected
on a national level.

269
00:19:24,38 --> 00:19:28,60
No i don't see it as being
environmental matters.

270
00:19:30,05 --> 00:19:33,74
Just being used as a bloody
football you know and they grab it.

271
00:19:33,78 --> 00:19:37,54
If they think it's a few votes in a knock
down if they think these few votes

272
00:19:37,54 --> 00:19:38,41
that way you know.

273
00:19:39,44 --> 00:19:46,04
However we're rapidly coming to the stage
where something is going to have to be

274
00:19:46,04 --> 00:19:52,14
done. When we can no longer walk outside
the front door in daylight hours.

275
00:19:52,49 --> 00:19:54,34
People start to get worried.

276
00:19:54,60 --> 00:19:58,57
You know i don't think people don't really
want to be troubling dates you know

277
00:19:58,57 --> 00:19:59,70
we're going to have to be.

278
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,71
No our bloody reflective suit you know
sometimes i wonder i mean we're no living in

279
00:20:03,71 --> 00:20:03,90
a day

280
00:20:03,90 --> 00:20:08,87
and age where you are being peddled you
the shielding clothing it's slip on a hat

281
00:20:08,87 --> 00:20:10,76
put on 15 plus and you go outside

282
00:20:11,79 --> 00:20:14,58
and then you're saying well the air
pollution problem is not really

283
00:20:14,58 --> 00:20:17,14
that bad just yet. We had a
factor of three point two.

284
00:20:20,10 --> 00:20:22,91
All at what point do we say enough.

285
00:20:22,95 --> 00:20:28,52
Well look it's even crazier a place like
this which was a model in an area which

286
00:20:28,52 --> 00:20:29,44
acts like a model

287
00:20:29,44 --> 00:20:35,02
and one of the many areas around the world
is in fact being discriminated to the

288
00:20:35,02 --> 00:20:39,55
point it has a hard time sustaining itself
we still have state government in a fact.

289
00:20:42,84 --> 00:20:47,31
While undermining a sensual parts of our
local economy because it doesn't recognise

290
00:20:47,31 --> 00:20:52,54
it just yet. I mean at
this day and age is crazy.

291
00:20:55,20 --> 00:20:58,09
As one of them. You know renewable
energy is one ever met.

292
00:20:58,23 --> 00:21:01,40
It would also go with waste
disposal toxic algae.

293
00:21:01,42 --> 00:21:06,14
It goes with state systems
dispersion of grants

294
00:21:06,14 --> 00:21:10,88
and so on. I found over the
years that government.

295
00:21:11,66 --> 00:21:13,74
We always assume too much
brains in the government.

296
00:21:13,88 --> 00:21:19,12
You know the government is a system
and the flow of money like an abc.

297
00:21:19,42 --> 00:21:22,42
And it's coming back in
for the tide of taxation.

298
00:21:22,76 --> 00:21:27,10
We've got several hundred you know a
hundred billion is going into the treasury

299
00:21:27,10 --> 00:21:28,16
covers and then.

300
00:21:28,59 --> 00:21:32,14
In tax reimbursement comes out again
and goes back and forth in government

301
00:21:32,14 --> 00:21:37,85
and people and that is a very morally
process very slow to change.

302
00:21:37,86 --> 00:21:39,28
So you'll find

303
00:21:39,28 --> 00:21:43,35
that there is established ways of getting
money into the community we pay our

304
00:21:43,35 --> 00:21:45,74
farmers at sea as our role for research.

305
00:21:45,75 --> 00:21:49,59
We support our wool industry we want to put
some money into the sugar industry want

306
00:21:49,59 --> 00:21:53,67
to support our doll dependents.
We want to get people's.

307
00:21:53,68 --> 00:21:55,59
Legal things through our money goes back

308
00:21:55,59 --> 00:21:59,33
and forth as our souls says
this whole change society.

309
00:22:00,78 --> 00:22:04,04
Now what has have to happen is
we're going to have to take this.

310
00:22:04,70 --> 00:22:08,57
Abnd flow of of money and
redirect it completely.

311
00:22:08,63 --> 00:22:11,35
We're going to have to get a lot
of to things that are negative

312
00:22:12,24 --> 00:22:13,77
and put into things sort of positive

313
00:22:13,77 --> 00:22:17,52
and it's a very simple process it
just means not put into petrol

314
00:22:17,52 --> 00:22:19,35
and a come of the companies first

315
00:22:20,05 --> 00:22:24,11
and allow one farmer to go broke for a
million bucks to the bank on a bit of land

316
00:22:24,11 --> 00:22:27,96
that he's poisoning into soul goes into
melbourne into the air you know we have to

317
00:22:27,96 --> 00:22:31,58
get a thousand people
working with their hands.

318
00:22:31,60 --> 00:22:36,57
And there are still people in government
saying. You can get away with that.

319
00:22:36,71 --> 00:22:40,89
Yes of course you want to do it because
they don't know if you put a barrier there

320
00:22:40,89 --> 00:22:45,02
saying that lance going to cost you
fifty thousand bucks. You know.

321
00:22:45,89 --> 00:22:49,15
It is going back to the land that's what
all it was all about the 21st century to

322
00:22:49,15 --> 00:22:52,51
me it's going to be marshall
mcluhan's global village

323
00:22:52,51 --> 00:22:54,81
and you cannot live on the
land with a fax machine

324
00:22:54,81 --> 00:22:59,56
and you can work for solomon brothers in
new york you don't have to live in a city

325
00:22:59,56 --> 00:23:04,26
anymore. You know and therefore we can
get away from dichotomy between the city

326
00:23:04,26 --> 00:23:08,12
and the rural land and we actually
can saying people are merging in

327
00:23:08,12 --> 00:23:12,84
and become the caretakers of society
where we believe that the third wave

328
00:23:12,84 --> 00:23:19,73
that toffler wrote about is actually
it started you know industrialisation

329
00:23:19,74 --> 00:23:23,38
is dead it just going to take a while
for it to wake up to that fact

330
00:23:24,13 --> 00:23:25,96
and lay down and get buried.

331
00:23:26,62 --> 00:23:28,49
But industrialization is finished

332
00:23:28,49 --> 00:23:33,67
and the new tribal the
new village is there

333
00:23:33,67 --> 00:23:35,59
and the air space.

334
00:23:35,86 --> 00:23:40,96
It's how many people got we've all got
telephones you know a couple of years ago

335
00:23:42,16 --> 00:23:45,86
before we got our strata title we couldn't
afford telephones they were it eighteen

336
00:23:45,86 --> 00:23:49,03
hundred dollars to put
one all in the animal.

337
00:23:49,04 --> 00:23:53,28
We cities we've got the strata $400
and it was ridiculous isn't it.

338
00:23:53,38 --> 00:24:00,17
We've got we've got a system of
government now that allows. Yes.

339
00:24:01,11 --> 00:24:04,24
To get money from the taxpayer.

340
00:24:04,25 --> 00:24:10,37
To drive a car built in
japan with oil harvested

341
00:24:11,09 --> 00:24:16,83
in saudi arabia to buy vegetables
grown even switcher in thailand

342
00:24:17,81 --> 00:24:22,41
and we were wondering why report it. We're
poor because we don't make our own cups.

343
00:24:22,62 --> 00:24:25,40
We all make our own shirts we
don't we don't grow our own food.

344
00:24:27,26 --> 00:24:30,18
And yes insta me the
answers are here it's just

345
00:24:30,18 --> 00:24:34,43
that this is only a microcosm this now
has to be translated whole value here

346
00:24:34,43 --> 00:24:39,77
when you go back to lismore as you just
get down off the hill part onto the flats

347
00:24:39,77 --> 00:24:43,84
down there. Those flats in the
thirties used to provide sydney

348
00:24:43,84 --> 00:24:50,51
and melbourne with onions and christ knows
what else. Tomatoes here and beans.

349
00:24:50,66 --> 00:24:54,45
There's nothing there now but cloven hoof.

350
00:24:55,91 --> 00:24:58,65
Down trodden bloody addicts

351
00:24:59,45 --> 00:25:03,14
that you look at is an
obscenity those still strip.

352
00:25:04,15 --> 00:25:05,00
Desperately needed

353
00:25:05,00 --> 00:25:10,59
and we need if we're going to repair the
ozone by using the oxygen then it should

354
00:25:10,59 --> 00:25:15,59
be against the world law for anybody
else to cut down a solitary bloody tree

355
00:25:15,59 --> 00:25:22,37
and less if a pine tree slash intrigue
because the only thing trees don't do is

356
00:25:22,37 --> 00:25:26,94
use. And the real obscenity is
not even the moron who cuts down

357
00:25:26,94 --> 00:25:28,77
that tree on the on the slope.

358
00:25:28,89 --> 00:25:33,29
Because you want to get more grass here is
cow the real obscenity is debt are whole

359
00:25:33,29 --> 00:25:36,82
system pays for that nonsense and
actually obstruct the opposite.

360
00:25:36,83 --> 00:25:40,67
Yes because the power has been
flowing into exactly that group

361
00:25:41,36 --> 00:25:46,16
and so you're getting a situation where
literally your assets are being stripped

362
00:25:46,16 --> 00:25:52,33
day and out on taxpayers money.
Still today. Well a tree.

363
00:25:52,36 --> 00:25:53,48
Today you know to go

364
00:25:53,48 --> 00:25:59,79
and buy a tree today of the forestry
plus about 25 bucks is a tree is.

365
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:06,21
Growing for something like 70 bloody years
as true value should be ran about three

366
00:26:06,21 --> 00:26:07,76
or four hundred bucks.

367
00:26:08,37 --> 00:26:13,24
John if i would be in charge of the
prime minister's department one day.

368
00:26:13,26 --> 00:26:14,44
I would do the following.

369
00:26:14,73 --> 00:26:21,27
I would say this land is worth so much after
you rip the trees out the arrow decile

370
00:26:21,27 --> 00:26:22,40
after 30 years.

371
00:26:22,71 --> 00:26:25,24
It's worth that much look at
that much to rehabilitate

372
00:26:25,24 --> 00:26:28,82
and therefore this is your
taxation base just like in china.

373
00:26:28,83 --> 00:26:32,06
They'll say you had your second cut your
actually go down to living standards.

374
00:26:32,16 --> 00:26:36,68
So it's not fair to allow a man to
sell a cow for three fauna bucks

375
00:26:36,68 --> 00:26:40,30
when in fact the taxpayer take years
and most rehabilitate that lance.

376
00:26:40,96 --> 00:26:44,34
Because he didn't own that soil. He just
and this is very important an ownership.

377
00:26:45,44 --> 00:26:50,43
All you own is the right to caltech and
encumbered a bit of land during your life.

378
00:26:51,06 --> 00:26:51,70
Right.

379
00:26:51,72 --> 00:26:55,13
And if you don't have some some clothes
you give it you can't sell be it will be

380
00:26:55,13 --> 00:26:57,82
some other thing but you don't
own the land you don't own soil

381
00:26:57,82 --> 00:27:00,44
that is owned by the
government all the minerals

382
00:27:00,44 --> 00:27:02,46
and their own where the government
aerodrome but the government.

383
00:27:02,61 --> 00:27:04,31
The only had the right to use

384
00:27:04,31 --> 00:27:09,35
and therefore conventional economics betrays
the future generation because it says

385
00:27:10,14 --> 00:27:13,80
rip rip rip rip rip rip pretty mount pocket
and off i go to england or whatever.

386
00:27:13,93 --> 00:27:19,97
I was amazed when roz
kelly snatched back this.

387
00:27:19,99 --> 00:27:23,19
Training package for primary school.

388
00:27:23,21 --> 00:27:29,56
That said it told the truth then our
current disses are destroying the year.

389
00:27:29,58 --> 00:27:33,19
And the farming lobby is so
bloody strong in this country

390
00:27:33,94 --> 00:27:38,22
that the thing was ready to go out to
the schools and they got it stopped.

391
00:27:38,37 --> 00:27:41,80
I find that scandalous they don't
want the truth to be known

392
00:27:41,80 --> 00:27:48,31
but i think most young children
today. Know what's going on.

393
00:27:48,71 --> 00:27:55,32
I think the primary school teachers are
doing a tremendous job with regards to the

394
00:27:55,32 --> 00:27:59,68
enviro meant problems. I don't know
whether that's having any effect.

395
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:02,62
It's on the way kids
behave with litter and all

396
00:28:02,62 --> 00:28:04,29
that because i don't really observe it.

397
00:28:04,32 --> 00:28:06,28
I have kids around here are
generally pretty good.

398
00:28:07,30 --> 00:28:13,96
Because if any adult sees a child drop
a piece of litter they do say that up.

399
00:28:15,19 --> 00:28:18,77
To peter thank you very much indeed.

400
00:28:19,03 --> 00:28:23,34
Thanks and would you like cup of tea.
