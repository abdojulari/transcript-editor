1
00:00:13,82 --> 00:00:17,56
I. Whether or not.

2
00:00:21,79 --> 00:00:28,64
Johnny jelly easily won
a double early in. Job.

3
00:00:29,10 --> 00:00:34,29
I'm johnny allen i was the co-director
of the nieman aquarius festival in 73

4
00:00:34,29 --> 00:00:40,67
and by dint of my role as director of the
australian new students a since then i've

5
00:00:40,67 --> 00:00:45,93
pursued a pretty chequered career leading
to my current role as events manager for

6
00:00:45,93 --> 00:00:49,74
the downing harbor thoroughly
responsible for all of the activities

7
00:00:49,74 --> 00:00:56,26
that happen in the outdoor
spaces of darling harbour.

8
00:00:59,63 --> 00:01:02,85
Yes. Niman in the
aquarius festival for me.

9
00:01:03,20 --> 00:01:05,83
Came out of the series
of strands of things

10
00:01:05,83 --> 00:01:09,61
that i'd been involved in i mean one
fairly important one was the other.

11
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:15,10
And one may wonder at first how cedar
can accept with him and what nimbin was

12
00:01:15,10 --> 00:01:18,59
but for me as i say my early
training was in theatre

13
00:01:18,59 --> 00:01:22,92
but i soon sort of became interested in
theatre in the wider sense if you like the

14
00:01:22,92 --> 00:01:26,94
other in the streets as theatre
in environment as the other and

15
00:01:26,94 --> 00:01:32,05
that led me into doing a series of
smaller events sorry and around sydney

16
00:01:32,05 --> 00:01:37,51
that were festivals but in the context
of going out to a country like asians

17
00:01:37,51 --> 00:01:40,73
and exploring the australian environment
for me it was a little bit about

18
00:01:40,73 --> 00:01:45,88
that it was as a young australian
that had been born in the country

19
00:01:45,88 --> 00:01:46,97
and moved into the city.

20
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:49,54
It was partly about
rediscovering country australia

21
00:01:50,31 --> 00:01:53,52
and rediscovering the environment and
then with it all of the questions

22
00:01:53,52 --> 00:01:58,01
that were being thrown up by environmental
damage and environmental pollution.

23
00:01:58,20 --> 00:02:01,82
So theatre was. One
significant strand of it.

24
00:02:02,59 --> 00:02:05,18
Another one was what i would
call the university culture.

25
00:02:05,40 --> 00:02:08,45
I think that i was a student at
the university new south wales

26
00:02:08,45 --> 00:02:11,96
and i think the universities around
australia at that point in time.

27
00:02:12,22 --> 00:02:16,95
I'm talking now the mid to late sixties
were an area of somewhat interesting

28
00:02:16,95 --> 00:02:20,87
ferment and ideas and
you know fertile ground

29
00:02:21,65 --> 00:02:25,09
when i think back to many of my contemporaries
at university where they've gone

30
00:02:25,09 --> 00:02:27,10
since it was an interesting time.

31
00:02:27,32 --> 00:02:33,10
So part of it was that sort of
university culture and as i say.

32
00:02:33,12 --> 00:02:38,08
In the chemical side of an embed for
me was it was a job as director of the

33
00:02:38,08 --> 00:02:40,36
aquarius foundation which is something

34
00:02:40,36 --> 00:02:45,61
that the australian you know students had
set up to try and encourage cultural.

35
00:02:47,30 --> 00:02:48,87
Circuit around the universities.

36
00:02:48,91 --> 00:02:53,07
So in the in the year as a leading up to
nimbin one part of my job was organising

37
00:02:53,07 --> 00:02:58,32
tours of everyone from jenny
lewis to eddie cool through to

38
00:03:00,58 --> 00:03:02,36
various environmental speakers.

39
00:03:02,51 --> 00:03:08,47
Ron cobb the cartoonist phil oakes
the original sort of folk musician

40
00:03:09,59 --> 00:03:14,55
a whole series of things designed
and where possible we took

41
00:03:14,55 --> 00:03:16,55
that in the direction of
not just entertainment.

42
00:03:17,03 --> 00:03:19,26
But in the direction of cultural tourism.

43
00:03:19,62 --> 00:03:24,18
I guess you call it all cultural
entrepeneur me so that was one direction.

44
00:03:24,22 --> 00:03:28,00
The other was of course. Rock music.

45
00:03:29,27 --> 00:03:33,66
I had in the years immediately
prior to nimbin i'd been running.

46
00:03:34,14 --> 00:03:39,83
One of sydney's only two rock venues called
the art factory which is down in golden

47
00:03:39,83 --> 00:03:44,25
street and that wiped out the factory
was in those days was a bit of a home

48
00:03:44,25 --> 00:03:49,14
and a breeding ground for alternative
australian music i mean many of the bands of

49
00:03:49,14 --> 00:03:52,13
the day that were drug etc..

50
00:03:53,22 --> 00:03:54,70
Had their home in the arts factory

51
00:03:54,70 --> 00:03:58,44
and probably if it weren't for the factory
they would never have existed and

52
00:03:58,45 --> 00:04:02,43
that you know some of those been.
Full. I like when a guy etc.

53
00:04:02,43 --> 00:04:06,02
Went on from reasonable obscurity
to be fairly mainstream figures.

54
00:04:06,18 --> 00:04:11,25
So for me a lot of it was was this
business of running a music venue and one

55
00:04:11,25 --> 00:04:16,86
that was very much about generating an
australian rock scene because it's hard to

56
00:04:16,86 --> 00:04:18,80
imagine now unless you live through it

57
00:04:18,80 --> 00:04:22,98
and can take your mind back to australia
with the sixties it's hard to remember

58
00:04:22,98 --> 00:04:28,39
just how how american straightening culture
was in those days you didn't listen to

59
00:04:29,13 --> 00:04:32,48
you know too much australian music you
listen to american music when you watch t.v.

60
00:04:32,48 --> 00:04:33,89
You watched american t.v..

61
00:04:34,08 --> 00:04:34,88
So part of

62
00:04:34,88 --> 00:04:39,59
that process for me was trying to give birth
to you know genuinely australian john

63
00:04:39,59 --> 00:04:43,52
or rock music which now seems
one when one wonders now how

64
00:04:43,52 --> 00:04:47,27
that can ever have been an issue
that it was an issue in in the 60s

65
00:04:47,27 --> 00:04:49,77
and then i guess the other strand was.

66
00:04:50,48 --> 00:04:57,34
What i recall in those days is as
being called the counterculture which

67
00:04:57,35 --> 00:05:01,15
is a phrase that people don't use anymore
but that there was a sense in sydney

68
00:05:01,15 --> 00:05:04,05
and i think quite a tradition
going back to the 30s

69
00:05:04,05 --> 00:05:06,82
and 40s out of an
underbelly of the culture

70
00:05:06,82 --> 00:05:12,94
that was was a little bit more adventurous
radical imaginative than the mainstream

71
00:05:12,94 --> 00:05:16,15
culture and there's a very
definite feeling in the city

72
00:05:16,15 --> 00:05:22,68
that as i say went back to the wonderful
characters of the 30s all of the the

73
00:05:22,68 --> 00:05:24,56
leader vines in the bee miles.

74
00:05:24,69 --> 00:05:28,78
There was a feeling of a radical
tradition and i was very interested in

75
00:05:28,78 --> 00:05:32,53
that both both in terms of. Arts culture.

76
00:05:33,23 --> 00:05:38,66
And perhaps less so politics and there
was a whole john were there for me

77
00:05:38,66 --> 00:05:41,36
that niman represented a
bringing together of a theme

78
00:05:42,06 --> 00:05:48,17
and then i guess the final one was what's
become known now as as the alternative.

79
00:05:48,19 --> 00:05:52,61
Turned of scene or the. The
new age movement or whatever.

80
00:05:52,76 --> 00:05:56,95
Those are terms that i think arrived a bit
later but there was also a sense that.

81
00:05:57,63 --> 00:05:59,79
That we were in some sort of crisis.

82
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,44
Yes i mean those days we talked about holes
in there is only if people thought you

83
00:06:03,44 --> 00:06:04,07
little bit mad

84
00:06:04,07 --> 00:06:07,97
but you know they were we were
talking about those sort of things

85
00:06:07,97 --> 00:06:11,24
when we consider seriously worried
by them and it seemed to me

86
00:06:11,24 --> 00:06:14,24
and to many other people that
i work with at that time

87
00:06:14,24 --> 00:06:17,35
that we were in a pretty radical situation

88
00:06:17,35 --> 00:06:19,50
and we had to investigate
some radical alternatives.

89
00:06:19,68 --> 00:06:24,43
So i mean what an embed threw up was
just one of many possible directions

90
00:06:24,43 --> 00:06:27,56
and i don't think we were
conceited enough that to say

91
00:06:27,56 --> 00:06:30,81
that you know this was the
direction but it did seem that

92
00:06:30,81 --> 00:06:34,61
that an ace we explored some you know
some pretty radical new departures in the

93
00:06:34,61 --> 00:06:39,11
ideas that we were probably stuck on a one
way trip that was heading for a cliff.

94
00:06:40,46 --> 00:06:44,16
So i guess all of those thoughts
came together as a background that

95
00:06:44,16 --> 00:06:49,56
that led me into dropping out of a you
know fairly tailored career is an a.b.c.

96
00:06:49,56 --> 00:06:50,44
Producer

97
00:06:50,44 --> 00:06:57,41
and into this somewhat less favorable
territory of a cultural entrepeneur

98
00:06:57,41 --> 00:07:08,07
and director of hippie festival.

99
00:07:09,92 --> 00:07:14,65
Ones always in those things ones always
attracted by a range of things some of

100
00:07:14,65 --> 00:07:18,91
which is sort of petty in. And.

101
00:07:20,46 --> 00:07:25,11
In terms of my own involvement
in various things.

102
00:07:25,25 --> 00:07:30,46
It's looking back on it's a little bit
hard to discern the motivating forces some

103
00:07:30,46 --> 00:07:34,49
of that i think stand a fairly small and
petty things like you like the people

104
00:07:34,49 --> 00:07:36,02
and i'm a very clearly

105
00:07:36,02 --> 00:07:39,28
when i grew up in a fairly
conservative australian household

106
00:07:39,28 --> 00:07:40,27
and quickly figured out

107
00:07:40,27 --> 00:07:44,98
that the sort of people who were involved
in things like the were in the arts were

108
00:07:44,98 --> 00:07:47,25
more interesting than the sort of people

109
00:07:47,25 --> 00:07:51,96
that i'd been raised with so i naturally
gravitated to those sort of people and

110
00:07:51,96 --> 00:07:55,29
that means hanging around the craft
or going you exploring various things

111
00:07:55,29 --> 00:07:55,68
that was

112
00:07:55,68 --> 00:07:59,87
that was the place to be so some of the
weather is sort of more lurid motives.

113
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,84
I think they're
intellectual and so i think

114
00:08:02,84 --> 00:08:08,71
that australia was coming out of a
conservative post-war period. I grew up in.

115
00:08:09,36 --> 00:08:12,23
Through the 50s with sort
of acres of the forties

116
00:08:12,23 --> 00:08:17,29
and straight he was a very
sort of grey suited short back

117
00:08:17,29 --> 00:08:18,60
and sides sort of society.

118
00:08:18,61 --> 00:08:21,52
It didn't pay to be very different
and you paid a price for it.

119
00:08:21,60 --> 00:08:26,67
So i think some of it was you know just
they were able instinct i guess of

120
00:08:27,65 --> 00:08:31,02
and i think also there was a as
part of the post-war baby boom

121
00:08:31,02 --> 00:08:35,43
and i really think that at that
point in time not just myself

122
00:08:35,43 --> 00:08:37,91
but a lot of my contemporaries really felt

123
00:08:37,91 --> 00:08:41,56
that we were in a position to change
things and change things we did.

124
00:08:42,12 --> 00:08:48,23
With for better or worse is now open to
question but there was a feeling that

125
00:08:48,23 --> 00:08:51,07
that you know that you
could actually step in.

126
00:08:52,52 --> 00:08:56,44
And you could actually be powerful enough
in situations to change the course of

127
00:08:56,44 --> 00:08:59,68
events and. And then
change the directions.

128
00:08:59,70 --> 00:09:02,89
So that's i think what it
what attracted me that that

129
00:09:02,89 --> 00:09:05,82
that intellectual side
of it and the challenge

130
00:09:05,82 --> 00:09:09,81
and the comradery of being
with like minded people and

131
00:09:09,81 --> 00:09:10,99
that you know they were
they were good times.

132
00:09:12,51 --> 00:09:15,34
I suppose young generations
always find the good times

133
00:09:15,34 --> 00:09:20,77
but a lot of it was made in your hair
down just making the most of times

134
00:09:20,78 --> 00:09:26,99
that would be aired.

135
00:09:29,10 --> 00:09:31,08
When we started.

136
00:09:32,17 --> 00:09:33,94
Evolving a festival

137
00:09:33,94 --> 00:09:38,48
and a program for nimbin i mean i
guess one of the first tenants was

138
00:09:38,48 --> 00:09:44,44
that what we didn't want to do we were
reacting against a nine hundred seventy one.

139
00:09:46,09 --> 00:09:50,37
Aquarius festival that had been held
on the the a new campus in canberra.

140
00:09:50,69 --> 00:09:53,71
When if they were acting against it was
actually a very good very enjoyable

141
00:09:53,71 --> 00:09:56,40
festival but it stayed very
much in a traditional now

142
00:09:56,40 --> 00:09:59,85
and it was about dance companies
on stage in the air to come.

143
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,71
These in theatres and music in halls

144
00:10:02,78 --> 00:10:07,06
and i think very early in the piece we
decided that in terms of the energy

145
00:10:07,06 --> 00:10:11,64
that we wanted to put into a festival
for that for the time in the place that

146
00:10:11,64 --> 00:10:16,72
that kind of festival really wasn't going
to be what we wanted what we were looking

147
00:10:16,72 --> 00:10:21,33
for something which was much more able
to to explore wire to wire styles

148
00:10:21,33 --> 00:10:28,31
and wider questions so culturally i
set out to shine network which is a

149
00:10:28,31 --> 00:10:31,64
word that. I don't think i
used until pepsis after that.

150
00:10:33,14 --> 00:10:37,05
In my role as cultural director i was
constantly travelling i'd be in perth on

151
00:10:37,05 --> 00:10:38,61
monday in adelaide on wednesday

152
00:10:38,61 --> 00:10:41,71
and you know back to back to
melbourne on saturday in sydney

153
00:10:41,71 --> 00:10:42,39
and then there again

154
00:10:42,39 --> 00:10:46,97
and graeme used to travel quite a
bit to gram dunstan like a director

155
00:10:46,97 --> 00:10:49,33
and what we would often
do was say arrive in.

156
00:10:49,95 --> 00:10:51,72
In adelaide for a weekend

157
00:10:51,72 --> 00:10:54,85
and we'd say ok let's take a fine
books who is there in this town

158
00:10:54,85 --> 00:10:57,61
that we think is actually
an interesting thinker

159
00:10:57,61 --> 00:11:00,40
and do whether they run a
health food restaurant

160
00:11:00,40 --> 00:11:01,84
or whether they run an
alternative newspaper

161
00:11:01,84 --> 00:11:04,30
or whether they've got an interesting
theatre group doesn't matter

162
00:11:05,07 --> 00:11:07,82
and we would constantly
throw these dinner parties.

163
00:11:08,89 --> 00:11:10,94
I don't quite know how we
manage the food and the cooking

164
00:11:10,94 --> 00:11:13,48
but 40 people would
come along with explain

165
00:11:13,48 --> 00:11:15,44
that we were you know
trying to do this gathering

166
00:11:15,44 --> 00:11:20,58
that was very much about exploring new
turn into new cultures usually quite a lot

167
00:11:20,58 --> 00:11:21,90
of people would that would get up

168
00:11:21,90 --> 00:11:25,33
and sort of say ah you know you know you're
still living in the sixties man then

169
00:11:25,33 --> 00:11:28,29
she realised things to you know this
doesn't happen anymore and we would leave

170
00:11:29,08 --> 00:11:31,72
and then of the 40 people they'd be
five people sitting there saying

171
00:11:31,72 --> 00:11:33,32
when do we start. Sounds great.

172
00:11:33,64 --> 00:11:34,22
What we do next

173
00:11:35,12 --> 00:11:39,13
and say are slowly we accumulated this
sort of you know some hundreds of people

174
00:11:39,13 --> 00:11:41,86
around the country who were
interested in the thing

175
00:11:41,86 --> 00:11:44,74
and interested to the point of stopping
everything else in their lives

176
00:11:44,74 --> 00:11:49,18
and making a total commitment and
culturally i was interested in following

177
00:11:49,18 --> 00:11:53,45
that through to you know who were the people
who were the instigators whether they

178
00:11:53,45 --> 00:11:58,87
were the musicians who were genuinely
creating a strange honor of music

179
00:11:58,87 --> 00:11:59,87
or whether they were.

180
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,56
The people who were thinking
passed the other in in four walls.

181
00:12:04,71 --> 00:12:08,88
So there was quiet a network there
and that was both a national network

182
00:12:08,88 --> 00:12:10,15
and an international network.

183
00:12:11,66 --> 00:12:15,69
It was national because we were drawing
off a university circuit today

184
00:12:15,69 --> 00:12:17,68
that would be pretty
limited. But in those days

185
00:12:17,68 --> 00:12:21,10
that university circuit had inroads into
the cultures of most of the australian

186
00:12:21,10 --> 00:12:26,64
cities pretty deeply so that there
were few thousand people ultimately

187
00:12:26,64 --> 00:12:27,54
that were part of

188
00:12:27,54 --> 00:12:31,93
that great find probably did represent an
interesting thing take of of people in

189
00:12:31,93 --> 00:12:35,46
australia and then there was an
international network which was looser.

190
00:12:36,06 --> 00:12:40,34
Which would simply come about by every
time i heard of some interesting

191
00:12:40,34 --> 00:12:42,42
organisation or performer overseas

192
00:12:42,42 --> 00:12:44,65
that seemed in tune with nimbin
i would write them a letter.

193
00:12:46,07 --> 00:12:49,92
And sort of this massive bank of
goes by and it's basically again.

194
00:12:49,93 --> 00:12:52,44
Simply saying what we're
doing in inviting them over

195
00:12:52,44 --> 00:12:57,46
and then sort of you know talking to funding
bodies like the australia council it's

196
00:12:57,46 --> 00:13:00,32
a to see what assistance
we could line up so and

197
00:13:00,32 --> 00:13:04,49
that was all very much on a basis of what
i guess i would call tribal cultures

198
00:13:04,49 --> 00:13:07,53
whether they were people coming from.

199
00:13:07,55 --> 00:13:12,03
Tribal cultures such as africa and india
that were literally still living.

200
00:13:12,22 --> 00:13:14,27
Semi tribal lifestyle

201
00:13:14,27 --> 00:13:18,05
or whether it was the urban tribes of the
philly parties of the labor from paris.

202
00:13:18,08 --> 00:13:20,51
There were you know we're
just part of this.

203
00:13:20,53 --> 00:13:21,99
Global counterculture

204
00:13:21,99 --> 00:13:27,03
but we gradually attracted quite a few
people some of whom we actually managed to

205
00:13:27,03 --> 00:13:28,89
organize air tickets or fares for

206
00:13:28,89 --> 00:13:33,31
and sort of you know came semi officially
others who just had heard about it in a

207
00:13:33,31 --> 00:13:35,58
bar in berlin and sort of
thought it sounded interesting

208
00:13:35,58 --> 00:13:38,70
and they were at a bit of a loose end so
they started making their way to australia

209
00:13:38,70 --> 00:13:39,40
so

210
00:13:39,40 --> 00:13:43,95
that was actually quite an interesting till
gummidge i mean in the three months leading

211
00:13:43,95 --> 00:13:49,43
up to nimbin they would have been
left 3 3 500 people living up there

212
00:13:49,43 --> 00:13:52,10
and working around the
clock on building toilets.

213
00:13:52,32 --> 00:13:54,91
You know organising food chains etc.

214
00:13:54,91 --> 00:13:59,03
With no idea of how many people were
going to turn up to the festival in may.

215
00:13:59,05 --> 00:13:59,93
I mean it could have been.

216
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,58
Sort of you know a couple of thousand it
could have been 50 thousand nobody really

217
00:14:03,58 --> 00:14:06,59
knew because no one was
enrolling in advance

218
00:14:06,59 --> 00:14:11,42
or sending you know the same thing in their
interest which made the australian new

219
00:14:11,42 --> 00:14:14,54
students rather nervous i
must add i think graham

220
00:14:14,54 --> 00:14:19,42
and i would say there's the madman the
public going to destroy the union forever

221
00:14:20,38 --> 00:14:23,64
and every time we turn around there be
another knife in the back so to speak

222
00:14:23,64 --> 00:14:27,35
but it did give rise to this sort of.

223
00:14:28,40 --> 00:14:31,33
I mean my guess is that
something something between 10

224
00:14:31,33 --> 00:14:36,77
and 15000 people finally came through nimbin
we did manage to you know to organize

225
00:14:36,77 --> 00:14:39,31
the food the food chains
in the first aid etc.

226
00:14:39,31 --> 00:14:45,00
Say that nobody starve nobody died and
it was a fairly interesting gathering

227
00:14:45,00 --> 00:14:48,12
and one where i think
what was unique about it.

228
00:14:48,23 --> 00:14:50,60
And what came out of

229
00:14:50,60 --> 00:14:54,93
that whole process as i think everyone
approached it not so much in terms of where

230
00:14:54,93 --> 00:14:57,61
paying a gate family coming to
a festival to be entertained.

231
00:14:58,24 --> 00:15:01,10
Everyone approached at the other way
around. We're coming to make it happen.

232
00:15:01,10 --> 00:15:03,16
We kept saying there's
no program the program.

233
00:15:03,18 --> 00:15:06,64
What are you going to do and
people came with that attitude.

234
00:15:07,09 --> 00:15:08,63
I mean the remarkable way

235
00:15:08,63 --> 00:15:12,62
and some people whom we've had long
communication with another have never heard of.

236
00:15:12,81 --> 00:15:16,22
I mean this sort of entire
kind of you know 10

237
00:15:16,22 --> 00:15:20,04
or 12 piece theatre group from new
zealand called blurter turned up in this

238
00:15:20,04 --> 00:15:23,89
wonderful bus that was the real sort of
magical mystery tour and just turned up

239
00:15:23,89 --> 00:15:27,74
and said we're here. You know we're
here where we perform where you like.

240
00:15:28,89 --> 00:15:32,35
So lots of people came in that
sort of spirit and very much.

241
00:15:32,40 --> 00:15:38,05
I mean i remember of using using
phrases like you know what you eat

242
00:15:38,05 --> 00:15:39,63
and whatever the whole the whole line was

243
00:15:39,63 --> 00:15:44,76
that this is a festival it's about culture
in the wider sense it's not about just

244
00:15:44,77 --> 00:15:50,29
bands on stage is it's about the art
of how you create your living space.

245
00:15:50,49 --> 00:15:54,81
It's about the art of how you cook
a meal it's about all of that city

246
00:15:55,71 --> 00:15:59,87
and so it was a very
remarkable campsite as all.

247
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:06,80
Say they hows nz of people camped
outside the small isolated estate in

248
00:16:06,80 --> 00:16:09,39
country town with some of the
weirdest and most wonderful.

249
00:16:10,95 --> 00:16:11,50
Structures

250
00:16:11,50 --> 00:16:15,33
and performances they were people in tree
houses there they were people is sort of

251
00:16:15,33 --> 00:16:21,10
that they had a lab rat domes there were
people who'd sort of carved out sort of

252
00:16:21,80 --> 00:16:25,19
holes in the ground people into a
piece almost anything imaginable

253
00:16:25,98 --> 00:16:31,15
and i mean part of the joy of the thing i
think was was wondering around through

254
00:16:31,15 --> 00:16:34,75
this bit of a magical mystery
land of all of these things

255
00:16:34,75 --> 00:16:38,41
and just encountering you
really did have the feeling

256
00:16:38,41 --> 00:16:42,52
that she didn't need to go to the stage
to be entertained whole thing was an

257
00:16:42,52 --> 00:16:44,79
entertainment and the fact

258
00:16:44,79 --> 00:16:48,47
that there were some people in there who
i mean you know an interesting example i

259
00:16:48,47 --> 00:16:51,67
think is phillipe pati who we've
heard about on the grapevine

260
00:16:51,67 --> 00:16:55,49
and managed to organise affair
from the australia council lisa.

261
00:16:55,63 --> 00:16:58,48
I think is the blunden
of this this generation.

262
00:16:58,51 --> 00:17:03,52
He was the most extraordinary man in
terms of balance and physical feats

263
00:17:03,52 --> 00:17:04,01
that i've ever met.

264
00:17:05,43 --> 00:17:09,68
So he came to lehman with no fee with an
airfare a year later he was paid a million

265
00:17:09,68 --> 00:17:14,07
dollars to walk between the twin towers
of the financial district in new york

266
00:17:14,80 --> 00:17:14,84
and

267
00:17:14,85 --> 00:17:18,60
when the festival sydney tried to invite
him back to australia for the bicentenary

268
00:17:18,60 --> 00:17:20,30
in 1988 they couldn't afford him.

269
00:17:20,37 --> 00:17:22,23
So there were you know
there were people of

270
00:17:22,23 --> 00:17:26,91
that caliber people who you know on a world
level i think are remarkable figures

271
00:17:26,91 --> 00:17:29,41
and then you know many people who give up

272
00:17:29,41 --> 00:17:32,87
and give a wonderful performances never
heard of before and never would again.

273
00:17:33,38 --> 00:17:37,73
All of which i think was manifesting a
little bit the spirit at the festival which

274
00:17:37,73 --> 00:17:40,18
said that sort of you know
really were all artists.

275
00:17:40,61 --> 00:17:43,74
I mean we live in a society that
makes special things about it

276
00:17:43,74 --> 00:17:45,66
and it in some people in
the multimillionaires

277
00:17:45,66 --> 00:17:48,89
but basically you know
will artists and somewhere

278
00:17:48,89 --> 00:17:55,76
or another in the true artist life.

279
00:17:56,47 --> 00:18:02,76
Wouldn't i wouldn't mind talking about one
more performer. It's it's that again.

280
00:18:02,78 --> 00:18:07,56
Let's go. Another another i think
very interesting performer that

281
00:18:07,56 --> 00:18:08,72
that we invited

282
00:18:08,72 --> 00:18:13,86
and it was again part of this networking
process was an amazing african musician

283
00:18:13,86 --> 00:18:19,55
called dollar brand and the mechanism
by which dollar arrived at him

284
00:18:19,55 --> 00:18:22,75
and i think was interesting because it says
something about this networking process

285
00:18:23,60 --> 00:18:25,88
through all these dinner
parties in different cities

286
00:18:25,88 --> 00:18:31,67
that i mentioned earlier we ventured sort
of cumulated quite a large number of

287
00:18:31,67 --> 00:18:35,29
people who weren't on the payroll and
had no title but it was just understood

288
00:18:35,29 --> 00:18:38,90
that what they were doing was working
full time but then investable

289
00:18:39,74 --> 00:18:45,59
and one of these was a very interesting
south african called bastogne who

290
00:18:46,74 --> 00:18:48,42
knew african culture fairly well

291
00:18:49,42 --> 00:18:51,75
and knew australian alternative
culture fairly well

292
00:18:51,75 --> 00:18:55,52
and he was determined to being what he felt
was the most significant musical figure.

293
00:18:57,04 --> 00:18:58,89
Of his country which is a brand.

294
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:03,75
We did actually again managed to get some
assistance eventually from the australia

295
00:19:03,75 --> 00:19:06,26
council for his fares and he was a person

296
00:19:06,26 --> 00:19:11,65
that just it was the most wonderful blend
i think of traditional african music

297
00:19:11,65 --> 00:19:16,24
and modern jazz in fact he spent his
divided his life between swaziland.

298
00:19:16,65 --> 00:19:21,24
And the manger jess for
the years in europe.

299
00:19:21,56 --> 00:19:28,14
And so again one one of those wonderful
examples of of someone who came to the

300
00:19:28,14 --> 00:19:30,88
festival and came uniquely
in an in a unique way.

301
00:19:31,93 --> 00:19:35,99
And there's just one more i'd like to touch
on i mean one could probably go on for

302
00:19:35,99 --> 00:19:40,14
an hour listing the amazing performance
turned up at neiman but the one that

303
00:19:40,14 --> 00:19:43,57
that i think for me was the one.

304
00:19:44,38 --> 00:19:49,29
Stop the whole thing out most
magnificently was a group that. Arrived.

305
00:19:49,94 --> 00:19:54,18
Very late in the festival in their
arrival was it was very special for me.

306
00:19:55,40 --> 00:19:59,72
There was an incident. Halfway through
the festival where someone was.

307
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,56
Alleged to have been peddling hard drugs
into there was a story about rape

308
00:20:04,56 --> 00:20:07,73
or whatever. All of which ultimately
turned out to be fiction.

309
00:20:09,07 --> 00:20:14,98
I think spinning off the idea
that. Nimbin it had happened.

310
00:20:15,44 --> 00:20:20,59
Very soon after the election of the
whitlam government coming to power in 73.

311
00:20:21,16 --> 00:20:25,11
And 70 to say and in the seventy three.

312
00:20:25,40 --> 00:20:29,77
And it's part of the whitlam government
coming to power it had been a pretty strong

313
00:20:29,77 --> 00:20:34,74
coalition between the student movement
and the labor union movement.

314
00:20:34,76 --> 00:20:37,48
And a low we weren't terribly aware of it.

315
00:20:37,49 --> 00:20:40,14
I think there are a lot of forces
there that were interested in.

316
00:20:41,75 --> 00:20:47,88
In nimbin being discredited not for
anything that had anything to do with us

317
00:20:47,88 --> 00:20:51,21
and what we were doing really but because
of that larger political context.

318
00:20:51,48 --> 00:20:57,09
So we could figure out this this supposed
drug insert was in fact a set up.

319
00:20:57,16 --> 00:21:01,20
But what it resulted in was the 21st
quite coming up from sydney the whole of

320
00:21:01,20 --> 00:21:04,78
nimbin sort of you know falling
into sort of two army camps.

321
00:21:04,79 --> 00:21:10,17
Left the radicals on one side and and
the twenty first class got on the other

322
00:21:10,17 --> 00:21:14,46
and then sort of a lot of lot of people
said sitting in the middle saying hang on

323
00:21:14,46 --> 00:21:17,13
we must cool this out and
meditate our way through it

324
00:21:17,13 --> 00:21:21,95
and whatever to the point
where it really took over.

325
00:21:22,00 --> 00:21:24,14
I mean the whole festival
became about this incident

326
00:21:24,97 --> 00:21:27,82
and it was blown out of all proportion.

327
00:21:27,83 --> 00:21:31,97
And i didn't cut quite know what to do
about it at the time except to to proceed

328
00:21:31,97 --> 00:21:36,53
with you know trying to bring the last of
these these marvelous guests which was a

329
00:21:36,53 --> 00:21:39,14
group from from india called
the bowels of been goal

330
00:21:40,48 --> 00:21:42,09
and the bales were quite unique in

331
00:21:42,09 --> 00:21:45,98
that they are one of the oldest musical
traditions on earth they go back to

332
00:21:45,98 --> 00:21:47,65
previous times in india

333
00:21:47,65 --> 00:21:53,96
and what they traditionally were in been
garrulity been gaily countryside was the

334
00:21:53,96 --> 00:21:56,98
deep seas the message being
is so even to this day

335
00:21:56,98 --> 00:21:59,93
when the bowels arrive in a village
in india everyone dance to.

336
00:22:00,43 --> 00:22:04,31
And as a great party you seldom even comes
to listen to the vowels because they

337
00:22:04,31 --> 00:22:07,89
actually seen you the news of
the day and this is a tradition

338
00:22:07,89 --> 00:22:09,58
that i gonna do you know
to thousands of years.

339
00:22:09,74 --> 00:22:16,06
So we had got to the plate for i had the
most famous vowel rupe of the day sitting

340
00:22:16,06 --> 00:22:18,63
in calcutta ready to come.

341
00:22:19,86 --> 00:22:24,71
I managed to you know to raise the fares
for them to come but i had no visas

342
00:22:24,71 --> 00:22:29,43
and getting them there and outside in
the fields there was this you know.

343
00:22:29,45 --> 00:22:32,90
Really was at the point where it could
have flared into riots that he moment.

344
00:22:33,16 --> 00:22:39,35
So i hopped on a plane went down to canberra.
I never met him before but sort of.

345
00:22:40,33 --> 00:22:41,28
Knocked on the door and

346
00:22:41,28 --> 00:22:47,14
and strode into to visit dr h c coombs who
was a rather remarkable gentleman who

347
00:22:47,14 --> 00:22:49,84
had sort of set up the australian council

348
00:22:49,84 --> 00:22:54,25
and been almost single handedly responsible
for post-war reconstruction in

349
00:22:54,25 --> 00:22:57,39
australia after the war and that
states was head of the reserve bank

350
00:22:57,39 --> 00:22:58,23
and a very powerful

351
00:22:58,23 --> 00:23:03,41
and influential man in in canberra so
walked into his office he sitting up there

352
00:23:03,41 --> 00:23:06,02
with this huge absolutely
clean mahogany desk

353
00:23:06,02 --> 00:23:08,58
and on on the table in the new i was but

354
00:23:08,58 --> 00:23:13,71
that was all on the desk in front of a bee
had the the local afternoon rag at the

355
00:23:13,71 --> 00:23:16,26
headline that read something
like sort of you know.

356
00:23:16,28 --> 00:23:19,13
Ten thousand students riot police beaten

357
00:23:19,13 --> 00:23:22,51
and was is absolutely sensational
it's piece of gutter press on.

358
00:23:24,75 --> 00:23:26,90
So you just just looked
at me looked at the paper

359
00:23:26,90 --> 00:23:28,84
and said i know who you
are what do you want.

360
00:23:30,09 --> 00:23:33,69
And i started to burble out that i've got
these six people sitting at calcutta

361
00:23:33,69 --> 00:23:34,51
and i'm and i'm trying.

362
00:23:35,12 --> 00:23:38,26
They just picked up the phone
to immigration said coombs here

363
00:23:38,26 --> 00:23:43,48
and they said you visas if you read in
that an hour. So i went back on here.

364
00:23:43,52 --> 00:23:47,90
Plane back then but managed
to get these people into.

365
00:23:48,63 --> 00:23:52,11
In vibe is bin and down to
nimbin by that by the next day

366
00:23:52,86 --> 00:23:55,21
and coincidentally they are i have

367
00:23:55,21 --> 00:23:58,14
that the neiman festival at
the height of the full moon

368
00:23:58,14 --> 00:23:59,65
and at the height of all this.

369
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,44
And drama that had been going on

370
00:24:01,44 --> 00:24:05,17
and their first performance was to
get up in the neath the full moon

371
00:24:05,17 --> 00:24:06,76
and just sing this absolutely.

372
00:24:07,88 --> 00:24:10,11
If you've ever heard the music
itself in the most lyrical

373
00:24:10,11 --> 00:24:12,17
and beautiful music you
could ever hope to hear

374
00:24:13,06 --> 00:24:15,92
and for me personally it was just
a resolution of the whole thing.

375
00:24:16,06 --> 00:24:19,75
I mean the next day for whatever reason
all of that conflicted been resolved.

376
00:24:20,23 --> 00:24:23,78
We never did actually quite get to the
bottom of what the drug bust in the set up

377
00:24:23,78 --> 00:24:25,21
was all about. But
anyway it all went away.

378
00:24:26,51 --> 00:24:32,69
People went back to to you know the
same feeling of you know tangible.

379
00:24:33,53 --> 00:24:36,43
Peace and cooperation and whatever
that the festival had started with

380
00:24:36,43 --> 00:24:39,60
and in my mind that that
magical concert under

381
00:24:39,60 --> 00:24:43,44
that full moon with the bowels of
bengal will always be one of the things

382
00:24:43,44 --> 00:24:48,65
that for me personally made the
home in the festival worthwhile.

383
00:24:49,54 --> 00:24:52,27
I guess the other one was finally.

384
00:24:52,29 --> 00:24:57,90
Fairly party coming down to sydney in before
he left walking between the two pilots

385
00:24:57,90 --> 00:25:02,11
with the sydney harbour bridge illegally
i might add. While he was doing it.

386
00:25:02,11 --> 00:25:05,96
They were policemen down the bottom
trying to untie the guy guy wires

387
00:25:05,96 --> 00:25:08,85
and i saying well if you do that will
be manslaughter and then saying well.

388
00:25:08,90 --> 00:25:13,07
So this is seen as he comes down is going
straight into a paddy wagon but all

389
00:25:13,07 --> 00:25:14,96
that aside.

390
00:25:14,97 --> 00:25:18,49
He did manage to minister
being the person that he was

391
00:25:18,49 --> 00:25:22,50
that the challenge in coming to australia
was to walk between the violence of the

392
00:25:22,50 --> 00:25:24,76
harbour bridge and that image
went right around the world

393
00:25:25,67 --> 00:25:26,82
and in fact i mean the mad

394
00:25:26,82 --> 00:25:30,97
and chappie feeling to it in a schnorrer
view over the fate of a few weeks

395
00:25:30,97 --> 00:25:34,73
and saying the spirit of nimbin conquers
the spirit of the industrial revolution

396
00:25:36,40 --> 00:25:40,76
and so they were i mean in a way. I i.

397
00:25:40,78 --> 00:25:41,42
I bring out

398
00:25:41,42 --> 00:25:45,00
that story because it illustrates i think
one of the things about an inborn that's

399
00:25:45,00 --> 00:25:47,70
been forgotten in the years in the sense

400
00:25:47,70 --> 00:25:54,68
that nimbin infiltrated in many many
different nimbin for me was never just

401
00:25:57,05 --> 00:25:59,74
never just a place. There's never
just a country town in new south.

402
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:00,23
House

403
00:26:00,23 --> 00:26:05,71
and it was never just a festival of 10 15000
people gathering for 10 days for minimum

404
00:26:05,71 --> 00:26:11,23
was always an idea and a
movement and a group of friends

405
00:26:11,23 --> 00:26:15,35
and many other things. That.

406
00:26:16,13 --> 00:26:19,07
Grew out of a certain cultural
condition in australia

407
00:26:19,07 --> 00:26:22,35
that was quite unique was
lucky enough to manifest that

408
00:26:22,35 --> 00:26:23,67
and to express it at a time.

409
00:26:24,13 --> 00:26:26,63
And then i think too it rose

410
00:26:26,63 --> 00:26:30,26
and then went again some people
remained physically nimbin and made

411
00:26:30,26 --> 00:26:34,24
that their home other people took
that that and him an experience

412
00:26:34,24 --> 00:26:38,72
or comradery aust or spirit or whatever
you might want to call it took

413
00:26:38,72 --> 00:26:42,94
that back to their universities
or their health food restaurants

414
00:26:42,94 --> 00:26:44,50
or their musical bands or whatever

415
00:26:44,50 --> 00:26:49,08
and i think for some years then there was
a certain kind of recognition of people

416
00:26:49,08 --> 00:26:51,16
who had shared their shared
part of that experience

417
00:26:51,16 --> 00:26:52,67
when they would meet there'd be a certain.

418
00:26:53,17 --> 00:26:55,82
Recognition in a certain common ground

419
00:26:55,82 --> 00:27:00,82
that they'd share this experience it was
really a lot more than just a town i think

420
00:27:00,82 --> 00:27:03,64
over the years it's become something else.

421
00:27:03,84 --> 00:27:07,65
Now i remember that in the
few years after nimbin

422
00:27:07,65 --> 00:27:11,68
and wasn't very respectable i mean because
of all those kind of tabloid press

423
00:27:11,68 --> 00:27:15,07
headlines about the drug raid etc..

424
00:27:15,37 --> 00:27:19,30
It wasn't very respectable and my mother
i mean never never used to tell people

425
00:27:19,30 --> 00:27:22,81
that i'd be above the minimum festival she
would always sort of explain some other

426
00:27:22,81 --> 00:27:28,64
way until the women's weekly started
running to page kind of photo stories on

427
00:27:28,64 --> 00:27:30,55
alternative lifestyles of nimbin

428
00:27:30,55 --> 00:27:33,96
and then my mother suddenly came very
interested in telling the neighbours

429
00:27:33,96 --> 00:27:37,53
and friends that you know that johnny
had been involved in this thing.

430
00:27:37,55 --> 00:27:42,84
So i think it went through many different
changes over the years for a long while i

431
00:27:42,84 --> 00:27:43,04
mean

432
00:27:43,04 --> 00:27:47,71
that the sydney morning herald was running
sort of regular features after nimbin

433
00:27:47,71 --> 00:27:50,55
what. Around the universities
there was this alkaline of.

434
00:27:51,11 --> 00:27:55,22
Discussion of you know after nimbin
what it said something about this the

435
00:27:55,22 --> 00:27:59,95
significance that that the event and
been in the lives of lots of peace.

436
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:00,14
Ok

437
00:28:00,14 --> 00:28:06,16
but it came then in journalistic terms i
think to represent a rather handy shorthand

438
00:28:06,16 --> 00:28:10,09
for alternatives hippies
drugs all of those things so

439
00:28:10,09 --> 00:28:14,10
that i think now we're nimbin so
dragged out sometimes ance is not a.

440
00:28:14,32 --> 00:28:17,79
Not a barber a b c who are this program

441
00:28:18,53 --> 00:28:22,18
but we're niman is dragged out now it's
quite often dragged out as a shorthand.

442
00:28:22,56 --> 00:28:26,52
First of a certain set of things
which is not very fair to nimbin

443
00:28:26,52 --> 00:28:31,06
or very fair to the things that it but
it represented because as i say i think

444
00:28:31,06 --> 00:28:32,91
that to really try

445
00:28:32,91 --> 00:28:36,61
and add up what niman was to so many
different people would be very hard.

446
00:28:36,88 --> 00:28:39,96
I mean i have lived very closely
through the whole thing

447
00:28:39,96 --> 00:28:44,13
and i couldn't very easily put into words
what neiman was the you know is now.

448
00:28:45,52 --> 00:28:48,83
And once you try and reduce those
things to sort of tabloid simplicity.

449
00:28:49,20 --> 00:28:52,74
You either missed the point of
the point beyond recognition.

450
00:28:53,23 --> 00:28:57,41
But i think the thing that came out of
it for me was that it was a gathering

451
00:28:57,41 --> 00:29:02,58
that brought together a lot of very
creative and important strands

452
00:29:02,58 --> 00:29:05,76
and then out the other end those
same strands went out again

453
00:29:05,76 --> 00:29:10,25
but they went out reinvigorated and
strengthened by a sort of dialogue

454
00:29:10,25 --> 00:29:12,66
and the sort of process

455
00:29:13,85 --> 00:29:19,03
that any man was so in many ways
it was it was what one would hope.

456
00:29:19,04 --> 00:29:24,93
A festival or a celebration is in
the society and for me personally.

457
00:29:25,48 --> 00:29:27,02
That's what i picked up on.

458
00:29:27,10 --> 00:29:33,17
I mean the last 20 years for me has
been not spent being an alternative

459
00:29:33,87 --> 00:29:35,68
society person or farming

460
00:29:35,68 --> 00:29:40,83
or whatever it nimbin the last 20 years
for me is been exploring that potential.

461
00:29:40,89 --> 00:29:45,38
What is the role of celebration. What
is the role of community events.

462
00:29:46,20 --> 00:29:50,78
Leading into what i now do which is events
manager for darling harbour in sydney

463
00:29:50,78 --> 00:29:54,46
running. Hundreds of projects a year
and doing a festival every weekend

464
00:29:55,69 --> 00:29:59,84
and looking back over my life i've
been i've only been if you expect.

465
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,89
Since is that that i've had that that's
that sort of social process that

466
00:30:03,89 --> 00:30:05,18
that was no nothing.

467
00:30:05,19 --> 00:30:10,72
The bicentenary in australia was one quite
very different event very different

468
00:30:10,72 --> 00:30:12,19
involvement very different colouring.

469
00:30:12,30 --> 00:30:13,04
But i think

470
00:30:13,04 --> 00:30:17,45
that you can almost talk about australia
before the bicentenary in australia after

471
00:30:17,45 --> 00:30:19,46
the bicentenary in terms of what

472
00:30:19,46 --> 00:30:23,87
that meant as a bit of a cultural watershed
in terms of australia's identity

473
00:30:24,66 --> 00:30:27,66
and in terms of the way we think
about i mean i think that

474
00:30:28,39 --> 00:30:33,60
and just as it's taken decades to work out
an immanent will take many more i think

475
00:30:33,60 --> 00:30:36,59
it'll take a couple of decades
to work out the basin too near.

476
00:30:36,67 --> 00:30:39,93
I think all the talk now of of
australia becoming a republic

477
00:30:39,93 --> 00:30:43,53
and the increased awareness
of aboriginal culture

478
00:30:43,53 --> 00:30:48,96
and how white australia sits with
it's it's it's it's a regional past

479
00:30:48,96 --> 00:30:52,08
that i think all of those
things are part and parcel and

480
00:30:52,08 --> 00:30:58,49
and that's what i what i what
i mean by celebration i mean

481
00:30:58,49 --> 00:31:03,05
celebration has or has in my mind
always overtones it's about very deep.

482
00:31:04,61 --> 00:31:08,21
Currents and cultural
thinking in the society.

483
00:31:08,23 --> 00:31:11,72
It may appear to be just about lots of
people sort of you know going out on one day

484
00:31:11,72 --> 00:31:12,53
and having a good time

485
00:31:12,53 --> 00:31:17,04
but if it's genuine celebration to
me it's it's a very profound thing

486
00:31:17,04 --> 00:31:19,33
that has all those. Waves of change

487
00:31:19,33 --> 00:31:28,32
and always reflections to it.

488
00:31:29,88 --> 00:31:34,60
It's interesting to think
back and speculate on.

489
00:31:34,61 --> 00:31:36,87
Where we're society's got to

490
00:31:36,87 --> 00:31:43,18
when people don't use the phrase for
example i haven't heard for years.

491
00:31:44,49 --> 00:31:48,27
The phrase counterculture or even
alternative society to match anymore

492
00:31:48,27 --> 00:31:53,86
and i think what's tended to happen
is that a lot of the insights of of

493
00:31:53,86 --> 00:31:59,13
that period have been taken on
board by the way the society.

494
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:02,12
I mentioned earlier for example that

495
00:32:02,12 --> 00:32:06,46
that in one hundred seventy three to talk
about a whole a hole in the ozone layer

496
00:32:06,46 --> 00:32:09,42
and to talk about the
greenhouse effect that's a.

497
00:32:09,45 --> 00:32:12,40
I mean they're there for
many years they'd been.

498
00:32:12,48 --> 00:32:16,02
And scientists and environmentalists
who were aware of all those things

499
00:32:16,02 --> 00:32:20,34
and you know that certainly will say
were common knowledge but in terms of

500
00:32:20,34 --> 00:32:23,87
that population in general if you talked
about those things you were either mad

501
00:32:23,87 --> 00:32:28,05
or you were complete radical it's been
interesting to see what's happened in the

502
00:32:28,05 --> 00:32:28,59
last 20 years.

503
00:32:28,84 --> 00:32:32,72
I mean society is absorbed so many of those
things they've absorbed the threat more

504
00:32:32,72 --> 00:32:34,18
i think people now realize

505
00:32:34,18 --> 00:32:37,38
that it's not complete madness to
talk about greenhouse effects etc..

506
00:32:37,72 --> 00:32:39,80
It's something that could be very real.

507
00:32:40,01 --> 00:32:45,61
It could be just around the corner and
people of all say are sort of absorbed.

508
00:32:46,36 --> 00:32:50,22
Some of the solutions i mean i think
that. Right across the board.

509
00:32:50,26 --> 00:32:56,68
I think the environment as assumes a place
in people sinking now which is radically

510
00:32:56,69 --> 00:33:00,09
different to that which
it did 20 years ago and

511
00:33:00,10 --> 00:33:04,07
that is reflected as it has
to be in very sort of.

512
00:33:04,08 --> 00:33:09,44
Fire and lifestyle ways in an environment
isn't isn't just about sort of.

513
00:33:09,46 --> 00:33:10,87
The mega picture.

514
00:33:11,03 --> 00:33:14,79
It's about what you do with the
ravishing how you recycle things

515
00:33:14,79 --> 00:33:17,84
and what you do with your life and
if it's not brought in trouble.

516
00:33:19,08 --> 00:33:24,54
I mean i remember leaving leaving
new york on one visit to new york

517
00:33:24,54 --> 00:33:28,81
and this is wonderful piece of graffiti
outside kennedy airport just as i was

518
00:33:28,81 --> 00:33:34,58
leaving new york that said ecology
last fad. And that scared me.

519
00:33:34,76 --> 00:33:40,34
I mean if if if if we do manage to let these
things like ecology in the environment

520
00:33:40,34 --> 00:33:44,91
etc remain just kind of fashionable fading
issues then the future is very bleak

521
00:33:44,91 --> 00:33:46,58
indeed. So i think that.

522
00:33:47,23 --> 00:33:52,45
Society is it has absorbed most of
those things the question i think that

523
00:33:52,45 --> 00:33:54,93
that we're all trying to
resolve is that one some sort.

524
00:33:54,94 --> 00:33:59,55
It's absorbed all those things are there
any solutions you know can we arrive at a

525
00:33:59,55 --> 00:34:04,03
sister. A nibble future and solve some of
those things the dilemmas are enormous.

526
00:34:04,28 --> 00:34:06,09
I mean i think we've got one part of the.

527
00:34:07,86 --> 00:34:13,13
The industrial first world sort of you
know busily now trying to trying to shed

528
00:34:13,13 --> 00:34:14,33
some of those worst excesses

529
00:34:14,33 --> 00:34:18,47
and with the same time we've got many
parts of the third world desperate do you

530
00:34:18,47 --> 00:34:21,35
know to do all that consuming that
there will be always been denied.

531
00:34:21,62 --> 00:34:24,31
So you've got the currents going
in both directions at once

532
00:34:25,21 --> 00:34:30,34
and the problems are enormous at the
same time i think human ingenuity is is

533
00:34:30,34 --> 00:34:34,72
enormous and i mean some of
my heroes from that time were

534
00:34:34,73 --> 00:34:38,77
and i think always will remain the
buckminster fuller's and people like

535
00:34:38,77 --> 00:34:41,75
that who take all that on board and say
look there are. There are solutions.

536
00:34:42,16 --> 00:34:45,87
It's a question of that's
becoming innovative an arf

537
00:34:45,87 --> 00:34:49,32
and thoughtful enough to work that through

538
00:34:50,65 --> 00:34:57,55
and i i don't know i mean i think i
probably see it on a little bit of the

539
00:34:57,56 --> 00:34:58,52
fence with all of

540
00:34:58,52 --> 00:35:02,69
that where we're going to be in another
20 years whether we're going to work some

541
00:35:02,69 --> 00:35:06,38
of those things through or whether we're
going to keep plunging headlong down a.

542
00:35:06,85 --> 00:35:12,01
Took living in i don't think anyone can
say i think we all know how important the

543
00:35:12,01 --> 00:35:15,31
issues are that we know what some
of the choice but it's not simple.

544
00:35:16,38 --> 00:35:17,31
It's tempting to sit back

545
00:35:17,31 --> 00:35:21,77
and say well you know the family argument
if only people would do blah blah blah.

546
00:35:22,65 --> 00:35:25,20
That's not the way it works
it's going to be a sort of.

547
00:35:25,83 --> 00:35:28,37
A long and a slow

548
00:35:28,37 --> 00:35:33,74
and gradual working through so
many of the signs are positive.

549
00:35:33,75 --> 00:35:37,42
That the problem is enormous and.

550
00:35:37,43 --> 00:35:40,92
I don't think it will be in my
lifetime that we reach a resolution of

551
00:35:40,92 --> 00:35:41,44
that i think

552
00:35:41,44 --> 00:35:45,62
that it's something the ball carry well
into the 21st century in another generation

553
00:35:45,62 --> 00:35:47,46
will be grappling with it.

554
00:35:47,52 --> 00:35:54,20
Long before long after i've
suffered off to a more peaceful

555
00:35:54,20 --> 00:35:58,81
existence than where else. Before.

556
00:36:04,17 --> 00:36:10,45
Like. Told.

557
00:36:10,46 --> 00:36:11,99
In terms of how

558
00:36:11,99 --> 00:36:18,80
that sort of celebration theory in
impulse of an indian is has made its way

559
00:36:18,80 --> 00:36:22,67
into the larger population i think it's
it's actually amazing to consider again.

560
00:36:23,88 --> 00:36:28,79
And yes you lived through and remember
accurately the australia of the 50s.

561
00:36:29,69 --> 00:36:34,89
It is very hard to realize the difference
between the looseness and the freedom

562
00:36:34,89 --> 00:36:38,68
and the colour and whatever that exists
in our society. Now that didn't.

563
00:36:39,19 --> 00:36:41,74
20 30 years ago. I mean
even just a member.

564
00:36:41,74 --> 00:36:44,82
When you saw when you saw a
male in a colourful shirt.

565
00:36:45,04 --> 00:36:46,70
It was unusual in you turned

566
00:36:46,70 --> 00:36:51,58
and looked twice now you walk through
any any sort of any shop in town

567
00:36:51,58 --> 00:36:52,76
and the sort of you know that.

568
00:36:54,43 --> 00:36:56,50
About that whole area of design

569
00:36:56,50 --> 00:37:01,02
and whatever's influenced our fashions in
our daily life to an extraordinary extent

570
00:37:02,15 --> 00:37:05,73
and to an extent that's mainly positive
it's also influenced i think very much.

571
00:37:07,76 --> 00:37:09,29
Our ability to celebrate and

572
00:37:09,29 --> 00:37:13,37
and our thoughts on celebration i
think it's it's a looser culture.

573
00:37:13,52 --> 00:37:17,94
One of the things that but that i've
always been deeply involved in is that.

574
00:37:18,48 --> 00:37:20,57
We live in a you know a.

575
00:37:20,58 --> 00:37:25,13
A european or what was a european
cultural outpost in southeast asia

576
00:37:25,95 --> 00:37:30,79
and what we did in that first
century in shriek orders

577
00:37:30,79 --> 00:37:37,50
or whatever was it was simply
import european culture into

578
00:37:37,50 --> 00:37:41,99
australia in the largely indoor
culture that we have of concert halls

579
00:37:41,99 --> 00:37:43,12
and theaters etc.

580
00:37:43,12 --> 00:37:47,94
Is something that was devised in a
european environment and came out of that

581
00:37:47,94 --> 00:37:49,04
and violence suited

582
00:37:49,04 --> 00:37:52,26
that environment you live in a cul climate
of course you want to go indoors.

583
00:37:53,98 --> 00:37:57,63
I think the challenge in australia
is to develop a culture that that

584
00:37:57,63 --> 00:38:01,15
that comes out of the australian environment.
Which is a totally different one.

585
00:38:01,15 --> 00:38:06,92
Where are much warmer subtropical culture
where very much an outdoor cultures over

586
00:38:06,92 --> 00:38:10,49
sort of the sort of cultural
experiences and events

587
00:38:10,49 --> 00:38:13,91
that have always interested
me are outdoor celebrations

588
00:38:13,91 --> 00:38:18,76
and outdoor events for two reasons
first of all i think that sort of.

589
00:38:18,78 --> 00:38:22,31
Is much more explorative of
the australian condition

590
00:38:22,31 --> 00:38:25,03
and it's much more you know
what's unique about australia

591
00:38:25,03 --> 00:38:28,66
and secondly because they can
be larger and more sociable.

592
00:38:28,84 --> 00:38:32,46
I think that those events where people
do that shoulders in the hundreds

593
00:38:32,46 --> 00:38:37,55
and in their thousands are very valuable
events and i don't think i'm alone in

594
00:38:37,55 --> 00:38:40,27
that i think that right
across the stage in society.

595
00:38:40,27 --> 00:38:41,64
There's been a move in that direction.

596
00:38:42,06 --> 00:38:46,03
I mean the whole there's a whole events

597
00:38:46,04 --> 00:38:49,47
and celebrations movement in the
industry in this trailer now

598
00:38:49,47 --> 00:38:51,07
that there wasn't 20 years ago.

599
00:38:51,29 --> 00:38:53,91
I mean it couldn't have been
about antinori 20 years ago

600
00:38:54,78 --> 00:39:00,30
and that's changed i think the way people
react the way one another though at the

601
00:39:00,30 --> 00:39:04,01
way they think again it's
one of these things that.

602
00:39:04,03 --> 00:39:09,97
You've got to take a long term view of
it may ask why why are people wanting

603
00:39:09,97 --> 00:39:11,16
there's experiences.

604
00:39:11,63 --> 00:39:16,78
And how is it changing the nature of
the culture and i think there are pros

605
00:39:16,78 --> 00:39:21,76
and cons to it. I think that increasingly
we exist in a culture where most people.

606
00:39:22,92 --> 00:39:25,11
Don't relate to their neighbours
or even their families.

607
00:39:25,14 --> 00:39:26,60
Perhaps as much as they did.

608
00:39:27,25 --> 00:39:31,66
20 and 30 years ago we tend
to sit in chairs in a room

609
00:39:31,66 --> 00:39:34,99
and spend many hours a day watching this
little square box called television

610
00:39:34,99 --> 00:39:38,07
and we relate to the world fairly much.

611
00:39:38,66 --> 00:39:40,62
Electronically and by the motorcar

612
00:39:40,62 --> 00:39:43,26
and if you go to los angeles
you'll see this taken to extremes

613
00:39:45,04 --> 00:39:50,28
and i think that's produced a civilization
where people just don't touch one

614
00:39:50,28 --> 00:39:53,42
another in flesh and blood
very much the way they used to

615
00:39:53,42 --> 00:39:57,23
when the cultural event of the week was
going out to a movie theater at least

616
00:39:57,23 --> 00:39:59,95
rubbing shoulders in the crowd
or going out to the sea.

617
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:03,62
Today and i bet it's we do
live in a more kind of.

618
00:40:04,30 --> 00:40:08,46
Technologically isolated and boxed
in sort of society and i think

619
00:40:08,46 --> 00:40:10,49
that one of the responses to

620
00:40:10,49 --> 00:40:13,94
that it's been for people to
want the experience of going out

621
00:40:13,94 --> 00:40:15,50
and being part of a large crowds.

622
00:40:16,45 --> 00:40:16,73
I think

623
00:40:16,73 --> 00:40:21,19
that if we could shoot 50 years into the
future somewhere into the sort of you know

624
00:40:21,19 --> 00:40:22,49
the year 2000.

625
00:40:22,70 --> 00:40:26,41
Whatever and look back on
the 80s and 90s i think

626
00:40:26,41 --> 00:40:30,61
that the the unique images

627
00:40:30,62 --> 00:40:36,06
and the important cultural events will
be those mass people events it's all the

628
00:40:36,06 --> 00:40:41,45
sort of you know the the light of a
concerts and i sent in reason and

629
00:40:41,45 --> 00:40:47,20
that all ships are all of those things i
think say something about this period in

630
00:40:47,20 --> 00:40:47,22
time

631
00:40:47,22 --> 00:40:51,53
and what's unique about the culture of this
period of time i guess i mean i tend to

632
00:40:51,53 --> 00:40:52,34
think about a lot about

633
00:40:52,34 --> 00:40:57,31
that because that's the work i do i'm
involved by choice in creating community

634
00:40:57,32 --> 00:41:01,39
celebrations and whether
that's a celebration for 50

635
00:41:01,40 --> 00:41:05,76
or 200 people are whether that's a celebration
for a hundred thousand people to me

636
00:41:05,76 --> 00:41:11,35
the mechanism the mains the same but
i do observe that that you know

637
00:41:11,35 --> 00:41:14,06
that people seem to want
that experience the fact

638
00:41:14,06 --> 00:41:17,73
that you can get a hundred thousand people
to come out for an australia day at

639
00:41:17,73 --> 00:41:21,58
darling harbour whatever it is says
something about a need for that.

640
00:41:21,82 --> 00:41:27,01
And so i think there's says a lot about
where we're trying to find a tribal society

641
00:41:27,01 --> 00:41:30,51
again. Some of us are
finding it by going off

642
00:41:30,51 --> 00:41:34,83
and living in small groups in alternative
situations some of us are finding it by

643
00:41:35,96 --> 00:41:39,46
living inside the wider
urban based culture

644
00:41:39,46 --> 00:41:43,12
but trying to find ways of reconnecting.

645
00:41:43,70 --> 00:41:48,19
Via celebrations and i'm glad we're doing
it that way because it strikes me that.

646
00:41:48,83 --> 00:41:52,50
Societies only seem to break
down all those boundaries

647
00:41:52,50 --> 00:41:57,61
and work together in a hugely
cooperative way for one of two reasons

648
00:41:57,61 --> 00:41:59,78
that happens in wars with this.

649
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:03,45
Response to the threat and
it happens in peace time

650
00:42:03,45 --> 00:42:04,75
when there's a cause for celebration.

651
00:42:06,15 --> 00:42:16,51
And i know which one of those
motivations i'd invite other work off.

652
00:42:17,22 --> 00:42:17,45
Right.

653
00:42:22,67 --> 00:42:24,57
If you had to try

654
00:42:24,58 --> 00:42:29,34
and sum up the the careers festival
in the ideals behind i would say

655
00:42:29,34 --> 00:42:33,14
that the first one was probably
the exploration of alternatives.

656
00:42:33,65 --> 00:42:39,18
The feeling that that we were reaching
dead ends and that in the state of.

657
00:42:39,89 --> 00:42:43,88
In a state of crisis such as i think we've
probably been in with so we've been in

658
00:42:43,88 --> 00:42:45,06
for so long that used to it.

659
00:42:45,08 --> 00:42:49,43
Now the site in a state
of environmental crisis

660
00:42:49,43 --> 00:42:53,35
and social crisis in many
ways i think at those times.

661
00:42:55,21 --> 00:42:59,65
The thing that you do is explore a range
of alternatives until you find new ways

662
00:42:59,65 --> 00:43:00,50
and find what works.

663
00:43:00,85 --> 00:43:07,76
So i think in terms of the the spirit of
nimbin the thing which would stand out

664
00:43:07,76 --> 00:43:11,69
for me. Most would be that that one of
exploring alternatives and whether they are.

665
00:43:11,85 --> 00:43:13,93
As i said earlier whether
they were kind of.

666
00:43:15,17 --> 00:43:21,70
Cultural alternatives or or building
alternatives or food alternatives

667
00:43:21,70 --> 00:43:23,64
or healing alternatives it doesn't matter.

668
00:43:25,44 --> 00:43:30,64
My own sort of you know approach
to that was a very very wide one.

669
00:43:30,66 --> 00:43:31,87
There weren't any lines.

670
00:43:32,03 --> 00:43:37,25
I wasn't about this new age
religion or theory or that one.

671
00:43:37,26 --> 00:43:38,97
It was just about exploring alternatives

672
00:43:38,97 --> 00:43:43,77
and was valid to explore them all in the
second one would be in these sound like

673
00:43:43,77 --> 00:43:48,62
funny words now because like i mean that
itself to be an overused so many times

674
00:43:48,62 --> 00:43:52,77
that that the words had to
know what the words now mean.

675
00:43:53,06 --> 00:43:59,93
But there was a very tangible. Spirit
and cooperation and brotherhood.

676
00:44:00,00 --> 00:44:04,44
Togetherness there was an im than that
certainly been fairly unique to me.

677
00:44:04,56 --> 00:44:06,80
I havent experienced it
many times in my life

678
00:44:06,80 --> 00:44:11,47
and ive never experienced it as strongly
as through it and im an experience.

679
00:44:11,49 --> 00:44:15,67
Why that should be so i am not quite
sure but i think it has a lot to do with

680
00:44:15,67 --> 00:44:21,98
when people are working together towards
some sort of common cause and that

681
00:44:21,99 --> 00:44:27,13
that does create a real brotherhood it
could create an intellectual affinity

682
00:44:27,13 --> 00:44:30,14
and it creates a sort of an emotional
empathy in all of those things

683
00:44:30,14 --> 00:44:32,31
that come out in words like peace and love

684
00:44:33,41 --> 00:44:38,57
but actually you know manifest
themselves in situations that work and

685
00:44:38,58 --> 00:44:39,77
and then i guess the.

686
00:44:41,19 --> 00:44:46,06
The third one to me would be a sort
of a cultural cultural dimension

687
00:44:46,06 --> 00:44:47,62
that i think nimbin did

688
00:44:49,31 --> 00:44:55,58
or did find new ways in
terms of australian culture

689
00:44:55,58 --> 00:45:00,24
in many different directions and
by culture i do mean fairly widely

690
00:45:00,24 --> 00:45:03,26
and i'm talking about sort of you know.

691
00:45:03,28 --> 00:45:06,31
Music in theatre in that i'm
also talking much more widely.

692
00:45:06,52 --> 00:45:11,41
I'm talking about the sort of the way
culture manifests itself right across our

693
00:45:11,41 --> 00:45:15,83
lives in sort of you know in in how we
relate how we eat how we dress how we build

694
00:45:15,83 --> 00:45:18,24
our hands. I think that to me it was.

695
00:45:18,46 --> 00:45:21,75
The cultural watershed as in the
way in which i could express it.

696
00:45:21,78 --> 00:45:25,42
It probably was a little
bit the culmination of.

697
00:45:25,43 --> 00:45:30,72
In many ways alignment happened in 73 in
many ways it sort of belongs in the 60s of

698
00:45:30,73 --> 00:45:32,62
some of our actually ticks were.

699
00:45:33,13 --> 00:45:38,59
But in many ways it was kind of
brought i think to to a head

700
00:45:39,40 --> 00:45:43,92
that pace war australian period where
i think that after the war that

701
00:45:43,92 --> 00:45:47,14
that people didn't have much choice but
to put their heads down and rebuild

702
00:45:47,14 --> 00:45:49,75
and it did sort of in a creator.

703
00:45:50,38 --> 00:45:54,39
A very conservative period and i think
niman was a bit of a watershed where

704
00:45:54,39 --> 00:45:59,78
that came to an end and it read a bit
of a way of tested it with the baby.

705
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:02,56
An all those sort of things
as well read a bit of a way

706
00:46:02,56 --> 00:46:05,41
that i think you can talk about
before nimbin and afternoon

707
00:46:06,36 --> 00:46:07,97
and a low it's very
hard to put into words.

708
00:46:08,38 --> 00:46:14,37
I think that there was a certain sort
of cultural change that around that had

709
00:46:14,37 --> 00:46:17,53
that had to do with the whitlam
government coming to power

710
00:46:17,53 --> 00:46:19,77
and many other layers as
well but i think from around

711
00:46:19,77 --> 00:46:23,03
that point australia
started to see itself.

712
00:46:23,23 --> 00:46:27,84
Both in much more in terms of
an australian culture and what

713
00:46:27,84 --> 00:46:30,53
that meant in terms of you know identity

714
00:46:30,54 --> 00:46:36,29
and identity expressed through films
music books social education thought

715
00:46:37,55 --> 00:46:42,08
and also one that we're still working
through and it may be the year 2000.

716
00:46:42,10 --> 00:46:44,98
Maybe significant our
place in southeast asia

717
00:46:44,98 --> 00:46:47,47
that although our history was out of our.

718
00:46:48,03 --> 00:46:51,44
Are you think altschul
outpaced our reality was

719
00:46:51,44 --> 00:46:55,76
that we were significantly
a part of southeast asia.

720
00:46:56,01 --> 00:46:59,94
And i think that sort of you know from
from that time onwards and that that

721
00:46:59,94 --> 00:47:03,01
but didn't bring that about but
an emblem was riding a wave

722
00:47:03,01 --> 00:47:05,02
that was about those sort of issues

723
00:47:05,02 --> 00:47:10,19
and a very sort of broad cultural
change which will continue on

724
00:47:10,19 --> 00:47:11,28
and my fervent hope is

725
00:47:11,28 --> 00:47:16,19
that we declare republic in australia in
an the first of january of the year 2000.

726
00:47:16,21 --> 00:47:21,08
I think it's suitable time to put
a full stop to that said she

727
00:47:21,08 --> 00:47:23,39
and say ok.

728
00:47:23,41 --> 00:47:32,14
New millennium new vision
new place in the world.

729
00:47:35,49 --> 00:47:37,78
I don't know whether there will
ever be another name in a way

730
00:47:37,78 --> 00:47:42,13
that there needs to the terms of the you
know the nimbin i mean it's it's quite

731
00:47:42,13 --> 00:47:45,09
interesting. I think

732
00:47:45,09 --> 00:47:57,80
that the celebrations of.
