16
00:01:25,76 --> 00:01:31,32
He's going to be speaking to us today on the topic of Magna Carta eight hundred years.

17
00:01:32,15 --> 00:01:45,37
I'd like to welcome NICHOLAS COWDERY Thank you. Oh thank you again. David we have to stop meeting like that.

18
00:01:45,39 --> 00:01:48,77
Yes Magna Carta eight hundred years young.

19
00:01:49,69 --> 00:01:57,81
And that of course is intended to focus on the idea that the Magna Carta is not Didn't barrier has not gone has not

20
00:01:57,81 --> 00:02:00,13
been forgotten. It is something with blue.

21
00:02:01,12 --> 00:02:03,43
Lives on in our individual

22
00:02:03,43 --> 00:02:13,48
and collective memories as a source of inspiration for lawmaking for the organization of the government of our society.

23
00:02:13,5 --> 00:02:20,19
And for the source of many of the principles that we hold dear.

24
00:02:20,21 --> 00:02:29,00
It's interesting when you come to look at history carefully and in detail.

25
00:02:29,22 --> 00:02:34,98
Now this is not something that I do on a regular basis but of course the history society is doing this all the time.

26
00:02:36,11 --> 00:02:41,36
And when I was given the task of chairing the Magna Carta Committee this year.

27
00:02:42,33 --> 00:02:51,75
I needed to find out a bit about this thing the Magna Carta. Because like possibly many of you.

28
00:02:52,67 --> 00:02:59,81
I have a general idea about what the Magna Carta was what it meant how it came into existence and so forth.

29
00:03:00,99 --> 00:03:09,32
And as I probed more deeply reading much from those who do know this subject very well.

30
00:03:10,18 --> 00:03:12,93
I discovered that the story is much more complicated

31
00:03:13,81 --> 00:03:22,09
and much more interesting in many ways than bland version that I had grown up with and still lodging in my mind.

32
00:03:22,55 --> 00:03:26,67
And I suppose in this year which marks the eight hundredth anniversary

33
00:03:27,82 --> 00:03:32,39
but also the one hundredth anniversary of the landing at the Poly.

34
00:03:32,66 --> 00:03:39,17
We have been looking at history in various ways and perhaps through more critical eyes

35
00:03:41,62 --> 00:03:45,37
and day we've just had there's been a lot of commentary about that

36
00:03:45,37 --> 00:03:50,01
and about what it has become I'm not going to get too deeply into that

37
00:03:51,78 --> 00:04:00,03
but there are two aspects of that struck me particularly when one comes to consider the history. You.

38
00:04:00,23 --> 00:04:00,88
You never hear

39
00:04:01,73 --> 00:04:09,95
or you didn't hear in Australia during the time of that anniversary about the other nationalities of soldiers who

40
00:04:09,95 --> 00:04:15,21
landed a guilty plea. About the Indians the French the Canadians the South Africans.

41
00:04:16,2 --> 00:04:30,69
Where were they just raised from history. And I wonder how many people who watched the dawn service. Deliberately..

42
00:04:26,33 --> 00:04:29,91
Really understand that the service takes place not in N.Z.

43
00:04:30,71 --> 00:04:39,56
But on North Beach which is around a problem tree and in a slightly larger area than the tiny little Anzac Cove.

44
00:04:39,58 --> 00:04:45,49
So history has a has a tendency to blur the details a little bit

45
00:04:45,49 --> 00:05:00,6
and so it has been I've discovered with the Magna Carta. We have a general idea of what the Magna Carta areas.

46
00:05:00,62 --> 00:05:09,11
The popular conception of this is that it was an agreement. Made in twelve fifteen between King John.

47
00:05:10,27 --> 00:05:20,85
And the barons of England. That it was a document called the Magna Carta which became law in England.

48
00:05:20,88 --> 00:05:28,55
These are popular conceptions of this instrument. That the document created rights.

49
00:05:28,57 --> 00:05:31,68
That has been construed on the plight ever since.

50
00:05:31,99 --> 00:05:36,99
As a foundation for the interpretation and the imposition of systems of government

51
00:05:38,1 --> 00:05:43,8
and it's the source of most that is good in public administration including democracy.

52
00:05:44,25 --> 00:05:53,16
The separation of powers the rule of law the independence of the judiciary trial by jury equality before the war

53
00:05:54,15 --> 00:06:00,17
and much more. Well. That's only partly to.

54
00:06:01,71 --> 00:06:13,75
And the real story is much more interesting and perhaps not as satisfying the pat as that account was.

55
00:06:15,59 --> 00:06:23,89
And I'm going to give you some of the surrounding story. To help set this instrument in context.

56
00:06:24,19 --> 00:06:30,77
And I'm going to finish then by coming back to some of the principles that we derive from this history.

57
00:06:31,24 --> 00:06:36,36
And some of the lessons that are there for us to keep in mind.

58
00:06:37,93 --> 00:06:44,74
First you have to understand that the time that we're talking about in the middle ages twelve fifteen and there abouts.

59
00:06:46,18 --> 00:06:57,51
English laws were not recorded as they are now. In fact it was not until five ninety four and the code of your thought.

60
00:06:57,52 --> 00:07:03,58
But the king of can't. The English laws actually came to be written down in one place.

61
00:07:04,2 --> 00:07:11,72
And English history was somewhat different in that respect from what is now the Middle East from Germany

62
00:07:11,72 --> 00:07:18,89
and from some other parts of the world where laws were actually recorded written down people could go to them

63
00:07:18,89 --> 00:07:27,71
and see what they were interpret them and apply them. But in England the laws were developed and passed on orally.

64
00:07:29,23 --> 00:07:35,73
So people spoke about the laws the rules that would apply to their ordinary day to day conduct.

65
00:07:35,92 --> 00:07:39,94
And it was necessary for the Lords the barons

66
00:07:39,94 --> 00:07:48,04
and indeed the monarch to have some understanding of what the laws were so that they could be applied day to day.

67
00:07:48,1 --> 00:07:54,55
So there was a much stronger oral tradition of passing the laws from one generation to another.

68
00:07:54,95 --> 00:08:04,51
Rather than having documents or written records that could be passed. On and applied.

69
00:08:04,53 --> 00:08:13,56
They were referred at the time of the we're talking about twelve fifteen referred to as the good old laws of England.

70
00:08:13,57 --> 00:08:19,17
And that's an expression that you find in the the documents. The good of laws of England.

71
00:08:19,84 --> 00:08:31,01
The principles that would govern conduct of and amongst the population of England. Now.

72
00:08:31,03 --> 00:08:34,48
At that time twelve fifteen there.

73
00:08:35,82 --> 00:08:43,28
The laws were applied as dispute resolution mechanisms ways of resolving disputes amongst the people

74
00:08:44,12 --> 00:08:54,36
and between the ranks in society. And the kings applied the laws purporting to act in the interests of peace.

75
00:08:55,6 --> 00:08:58,69
Peace in the community and the places of place.

76
00:08:59,03 --> 00:09:08,01
The meetings or if the king was present the courts where these dispute mechanisms were put into practice.

77
00:09:08,55 --> 00:09:14,19
And that's where we get our word caught many a courtroom. And nationally.

78
00:09:14,26 --> 00:09:21,14
It was only called the court if the king was present because it was the king's court rather than a legal court

79
00:09:21,14 --> 00:09:26,53
or a law court. And they became places for the enforcement of the laws.

80
00:09:26,55 --> 00:09:35,16
They were not as yet professional judges or professional lawyers or of course any kind of place force

81
00:09:35,89 --> 00:09:42,45
or law enforcement mechanisms. It was a very ad hoc arrangement.

82
00:09:42,47 --> 00:09:47,89
Violence was a problem and it was to be prevented by the application of the law.

83
00:09:48,44 --> 00:09:55,4
And very often the best solution to violence was thought to be the imposition of even greater violence.

84
00:09:56,38 --> 00:10:00,14
Some of that thinking I think is permeated through the aid.

85
00:10:00,23 --> 00:10:07,66
Just to present politicians but that was certainly one of the approaches that was adopted.

86
00:10:07,68 --> 00:10:17,01
And as I said every community and its lord needed to have a basic understanding of the law and to apply them. Well.

87
00:10:17,03 --> 00:10:25,48
Over time leading up to twelve fifteen Kings chose to ignore the laws.

88
00:10:25,5 --> 00:10:35,1
And this was what really led to the foment that created the circumstances for the Magna Carta.

89
00:10:36,82 --> 00:10:44,22
It's convenient to begin with Henry the first he came to the throne in eleven hundred.

90
00:10:44,24 --> 00:10:50,13
And the reason why he is important to our story is that he.

91
00:10:50,15 --> 00:10:56,48
Promulgated at the time of his carnation in eleven hundred a document called the coronation charter.

92
00:10:58,12 --> 00:11:07,59
And the coronation charter became a very important source document for the Magna Carta the coronation charter recorded

93
00:11:08,99 --> 00:11:17,91
the principle laws and the rules that would be applied during the reign of Henry the first as king.

94
00:11:17,93 --> 00:11:26,11
He promised to uphold the existing laws of earlier English kings and he sought to uphold what.

95
00:11:26,67 --> 00:11:48,26
As I said were described as the good of the laws of England. His son Henry the second. Was a bit more of a reform.

96
00:11:48,28 --> 00:11:52,69
He was by all accounts a tyrant.

97
00:11:52,7 --> 00:12:03,72
But his tyranny was very beneficial for the Kingdom of England and he expanded English territory. He set about.

98
00:12:03,74 --> 00:12:19,1
Reforming some of the laws. And he. Regarded himself as having a bit of a free rein about how he lived his life.

99
00:12:20,74 --> 00:12:24,48
He was what might be described as an affective tyrant.

100
00:12:24,49 --> 00:12:32,07
As opposed to his son John who was not very effective at all but still to run ical

101
00:12:32,07 --> 00:12:41,02
and we'll come to King John in a moment. But the problem with Henry the second.

102
00:12:43,03 --> 00:12:52,9
Apart from the little issue with Thomas Beckett. Which will pass over. Was that.

103
00:12:53,72 --> 00:13:06,31
Henry set about reforming the criminal law especially. He provided for juries and we have early mention of juries here.

104
00:13:06,33 --> 00:13:15,31
To report suspected robbers or murderers who would be detained by sheriffs for trial before local officers.

105
00:13:15,66 --> 00:13:24,93
So you have here the beginning of a system that would be recognizable today. Juries.

106
00:13:24,96 --> 00:13:29,23
Of course in those days were not selected because of their impartiality

107
00:13:30,76 --> 00:13:36,33
and their disinterest in the proceedings they were selected because they knew something about the people

108
00:13:36,33 --> 00:13:42,71
and the events that happened. And we've come full circle in relation to juries. But back in those times.

109
00:13:44,21 --> 00:13:52,09
Juries were given a row at prisons were built through England exile

110
00:13:52,1 --> 00:13:54,79
and outlawry were decreed from the Tory as criminals

111
00:13:55,7 --> 00:14:03,65
and other laws were enacted which in fact resulted in a flood of litigation. In the time of Henry the second.

112
00:14:03,67 --> 00:14:12,63
So by the eleven seventies there were in fact professional courts. So we're still some time before Magna Carta.

113
00:14:13,2 --> 00:14:25,82
But the beginning of professional course was to be sane in England. Henry had some internal rebellions and problems.

114
00:14:26,68 --> 00:14:36,85
But he put them down rather strongly. One chronicler of the time. Ralph Niger claimed in very strong.

115
00:14:36,86 --> 00:14:50,49
That Henry the second deliberately delayed judgments. So that justice could be bought and solved. And here we have.

116
00:14:52,43 --> 00:14:59,22
Clauses thirty nine and forty from twelve fifteen documents on display here.

117
00:14:59,23 --> 00:15:07,37
And I'll say a little bit more about those clauses later. But the practice of Henry the second.

118
00:15:07,38 --> 00:15:09,46
In the eleven seventies.

119
00:15:11,9 --> 00:15:18,23
Gave rise or foreshadowed if you like one of the central and most important provisions of the Magna Carta.

120
00:15:19,42 --> 00:15:30,08
To no man we sell or delay justice. And this was kind directly from the practice of Henry the second of of.

121
00:15:31,1 --> 00:15:35,38
Delaying justice so that it could be bought or sold.

122
00:15:35,4 --> 00:15:46,03
Henry promoted serfs and soldiers as officials which was regarded very unfavorably. He debased the monasteries.

123
00:15:46,05 --> 00:15:54,04
And debauch the wives and daughters of barons. Really not a very nice man. He overruled.

124
00:15:54,21 --> 00:15:59,81
Some of the old laws and set aside liberties freedoms that people enjoy.

125
00:16:00,23 --> 00:16:09,69
And that the church enjoyed from control by the king liberty meant something slightly different in those days from the

126
00:16:09,69 --> 00:16:14,5
lists of liberties or rights that we commonly see in instruments these days.

127
00:16:16,45 --> 00:16:28,96
And the king of much greater control over the administration of both criminal and civil justice. Now King John.

128
00:16:29,18 --> 00:16:36,81
I'm getting closer to twelve fifteen now. As you know from the Old Mill on power.

129
00:16:36,82 --> 00:16:43,46
Was not a good man he had his wicked ways and people wouldn't talk to him for days and days

130
00:16:43,46 --> 00:16:50,98
and days like a few signs of recognition around. The audience there. And King John was not a good man.

131
00:16:52,53 --> 00:16:57,49
I think there have been attempts to rehabilitate him over the centuries but not very successfully

132
00:16:58,38 --> 00:17:07,1
and it's interesting that none of the possible male heirs to the English throne has ever been christened John.

133
00:17:09,36 --> 00:17:13,41
So he was crowned in May of eleven ninety nine.

134
00:17:14,9 --> 00:17:22,64
So we're getting closer and in the next five years he piled catastrophe upon catastrophe at both a personal

135
00:17:22,64 --> 00:17:31,41
and national level. He lost most of his territory in France and by that time it was quite significant.

136
00:17:32,86 --> 00:17:37,91
The northern and western part of France was controlled by the English crown.

137
00:17:37,93 --> 00:17:42,08
He routinely abuse the law and his subjects.

138
00:17:42,8 --> 00:17:50,71
But little could be formally done because the law was regarded as an instrument of the king for the King Years.

139
00:17:51,34 --> 00:17:58,22
And the notion that we still have that the commission of a criminal offense is.

140
00:17:58,23 --> 00:18:04,03
The commission of an offense against the. Community comes from the idea of the king's peace.

141
00:18:04,55 --> 00:18:11,99
And the fracture of the king's face by unlawful conduct.

142
00:18:15,05 --> 00:18:22,91
And once he had lost Normandy in twelve hundred four King John was obliged to stay in England he had nowhere else that

143
00:18:22,91 --> 00:18:24,54
he could comfortably travel.

144
00:18:25,04 --> 00:18:30,43
And that just made things worse because he was up close with the barons and with the churchmen

145
00:18:30,43 --> 00:18:40,47
and they could see him for what he was really worth which was not good. And relations became worse.

146
00:18:40,97 --> 00:18:50,19
From twelve hundred five challenge the church. He sought to have his own candidate elected Archbishop of Canterbury.

147
00:18:50,21 --> 00:18:52,83
But he lost that contest and Stephen Langton.

148
00:18:53,4 --> 00:18:59,88
Who had been a staunch Beckett supporter was consecrated by the pope in twelve hundred seven

149
00:18:59,88 --> 00:19:07,47
but obliged to live in France because King John wouldn't have the Archbishop of Canterbury living in England.

150
00:19:07,48 --> 00:19:10,89
The church of course at that time was the church in Rome

151
00:19:12,33 --> 00:19:20,15
and the pope Pope Innocent the third was in a position to exercise very great power over the way in which the public

152
00:19:20,15 --> 00:19:24,62
affairs of England were conducted.

153
00:19:25,56 --> 00:19:36,58
Eventually in twelve hundred twelve Pope Innocent the third actually excommunicated England and the Royal Court.

154
00:19:37,54 --> 00:19:44,41
It's a pretty drastic step to take one might think. But King John.

155
00:19:44,8 --> 00:19:50,32
Since twelve hundred eight had suspended the activities of the English church.

156
00:19:51,42 --> 00:19:59,96
So from twelve hundred eight to twelve fourteen the year before this document. The English Church had been unable to.

157
00:20:00,23 --> 00:20:01,91
Perform its rituals

158
00:20:01,91 --> 00:20:09,13
and services people had been unable to avail themselves of their membership of the English Church

159
00:20:09,13 --> 00:20:16,06
and property had been expropriated by the King from the church so the church very unhappy.

160
00:20:16,65 --> 00:20:25,35
And Stephen Langton the Archbishop of Canterbury who was forced to live in exile in France started to agitate in twelve

161
00:20:25,35 --> 00:20:32,66
thirteen twelve fourteen bringing with him a group of disaffected barons and merchants

162
00:20:32,66 --> 00:20:43,08
and others who wanted to have something done about King John. So there's much more to the story as you might imagine.

163
00:20:43,42 --> 00:20:56,97
But let's jump to twelve fifteen. By that time. It had become clear that the king had. Had to surrender.

164
00:20:56,99 --> 00:21:03,13
If he hadn't he would have been deposed and probably beheaded.

165
00:21:03,15 --> 00:21:12,33
And he saw the writing on the wall if you like the writing on the bell and. So I that's a very bad time.

166
00:21:12,34 --> 00:21:15,72
He was forced to the table.

167
00:21:15,74 --> 00:21:22,87
It wasn't a process of negotiation that brought him to the table he did issue a document in twelve fourteen.

168
00:21:22,89 --> 00:21:29,7
But it was too little too light and it didn't give enough by way of liberties to the church water barons

169
00:21:29,7 --> 00:21:35,9
and they pressed on. And so eventually in Journey of twelve fifteen.

170
00:21:37,17 --> 00:21:44,15
King John was brought to the table to agree to the document and had been a number of drafts of the document

171
00:21:44,15 --> 00:21:49,71
and of course of the document that had been in circulation since like twelve fourteen.

172
00:21:50,31 --> 00:21:58,14
And some of those drafts survive. To show the way in which the grafters were approaching the task.

173
00:21:58,5 --> 00:21:59,75
And as I said the coronation.

174
00:22:00,23 --> 00:22:06,15
Charter of King Henry the first from eleven hundred was a very important document in the way in which some of the

175
00:22:06,15 --> 00:22:08,1
clauses were drafted.

176
00:22:09,35 --> 00:22:15,5
John was brought to a place on the Thames River between Windsor

177
00:22:15,51 --> 00:22:19,95
and London somewhere close to Staines in western London.

178
00:22:20,49 --> 00:22:26,16
And this was an area that was sometimes a riverbank sometimes an island.

179
00:22:26,18 --> 00:22:29,24
Depending on how the river was flowing that particular year.

180
00:22:29,82 --> 00:22:37,94
And until this event happened it didn't have a name for this event it was named Runnymede.

181
00:22:37,96 --> 00:22:44,5
Why this bit of Riverbank Well one of the things that King John had been up to.

182
00:22:45,48 --> 00:22:52,4
Was seizing merchant ships that came to England and how them ransom. And confiscating their cargoes.

183
00:22:52,86 --> 00:22:58,56
And this was very seriously disrupting trade between England and Europe.

184
00:22:58,58 --> 00:23:05,33
And so the merchants in London had become very dissatisfied and disaffected with the king

185
00:23:05,33 --> 00:23:14,84
and they had seized Westminster. So the royal seat of Westminster had been denied to King John.

186
00:23:16,00 --> 00:23:18,9
And he was living in Windsor Castle.

187
00:23:18,91 --> 00:23:24,55
And the reason why this place was chosen was more or less half way between Windsor Castle where the king was

188
00:23:25,46 --> 00:23:37,85
and London where the merchants and the barons were holding out and. They had refused to surrender London to the king.

189
00:23:39,18 --> 00:23:53,51
The document that was sealed at that time and this is one of the misconceptions. Was not called the Magna Carta.

190
00:23:53,53 --> 00:23:59,99
It was called the charter of liberties. I'll come to the Magna Carta eventually.

191
00:24:00,98 --> 00:24:08,85
But the document was called the charter of liberties. And it was sixty three clauses long.

192
00:24:08,86 --> 00:24:17,42
Including a number of clauses that were actually quite oppressive for the king imposing obligations on him to dismiss

193
00:24:17,42 --> 00:24:22,99
various people. To take action about various things that would have been quite a burden for him.

194
00:24:23,94 --> 00:24:40,36
Nevertheless he was forced to agree to it and to seal it. The document was written on vellum on sheepskin.

195
00:24:40,38 --> 00:24:48,9
And it was one of them. Bore the king's seal.

196
00:24:48,91 --> 00:24:58,24
We have four documents from that time but we don't have any more the one with the king's seal. It's gone missing.

197
00:24:58,26 --> 00:25:00,66
And you might of read that.

198
00:25:01,23 --> 00:25:08,33
For twelve fifteen documents that survive were brought together at the British Library in February of this year for

199
00:25:08,33 --> 00:25:12,47
three days and then to the House of Lords for one day and there were so many people.

200
00:25:13,01 --> 00:25:19,32
Forty thousand people applied in the ballots to be selected to go and view this for documents in the one place.

201
00:25:20,66 --> 00:25:24,4
They had to have a ballot and they issued a number of tickets for people to come

202
00:25:24,4 --> 00:25:31,72
and no surprise for guessing the number of tickets that they issued. One thousand two hundred fifteen.

203
00:25:31,74 --> 00:25:48,59
Marketing is everywhere. The first clause of the Magna Carta. Deals with the liberties of the church.

204
00:25:48,61 --> 00:25:57,82
And it's not until clause one secures the liberties for the church that there is then a sort of preamble

205
00:25:57,82 --> 00:26:05,6
or statement which leads in. The liberties for the free men of England.

206
00:26:05,62 --> 00:26:14,52
So rather than the barons being the principal parties to the document in fact the church is the most important other

207
00:26:14,52 --> 00:26:24,52
party with the king. To this charter of liberties of twelve fifteen. Free men of England.

208
00:26:25,6 --> 00:26:31,49
That's a bit of an elastic phrase we're not quite sure what that encompasses.

209
00:26:31,51 --> 00:26:36,85
The population of England is estimated by scholars to have been at that time between two

210
00:26:36,85 --> 00:26:41,29
and four million people not a huge number.

211
00:26:42,5 --> 00:26:52,31
And the Freemen might be anywhere between forty and seventy percent of their populations. So a bit rubbery.

212
00:26:52,32 --> 00:27:00,1
But nevertheless free men were those who could be distinguished from serfs those who had served our relationships with

213
00:27:00,1 --> 00:27:09,7
lords people who had free how land people who were merchants in the towns people who were members of the nobility.

214
00:27:10,42 --> 00:27:17,14
So it specifically excluded other people who didn't qualify as free

215
00:27:17,14 --> 00:27:23,8
and then it was not universal for the population of England.

216
00:27:24,66 --> 00:27:34,62
Well this was sailed big events off everybody went to wait for this document to be implemented for the king to do what

217
00:27:34,62 --> 00:27:35,57
he had promised to do.

218
00:27:35,79 --> 00:27:38,84
For the barons to do what they had promised to do

219
00:27:38,84 --> 00:27:48,72
and for the church to get back to its business with its liberties restored and for some time. Nothing happened.

220
00:27:48,73 --> 00:27:56,78
The king did not honor his promises. And because the king did not honor his promises the barons didn't either.

221
00:27:57,71 --> 00:28:05,98
And they remained in control of London. And they didn't make any of the concessions that were required to be nigh.

222
00:28:06,00 --> 00:28:19,00
And the pope got to hear about it. Of course and in August of twelve fifteen. The pope and now hold the document.

223
00:28:19,02 --> 00:28:28,48
And in September twelfth in King John repudiated formally at Dover. On the coast of England.

224
00:28:28,5 --> 00:28:35,63
So this document that we're celebrating on the fifteenth of June this year it's eight hundredth anniversary.

225
00:28:35,65 --> 00:28:41,67
Wasn't the Magna Carta it was the charter of liberties and it lasted less than three months.

226
00:28:41,68 --> 00:28:53,94
So what are we celebrating what are we getting excited about. Well the story goes on from there. In twelve sixteen.

227
00:28:53,96 --> 00:29:01,42
John heard organized by the end or set the circumstances for a French invasion.

228
00:29:01,82 --> 00:29:11,6
So there was warfare in England and at a battlefield not not on the battlefield and not from battle wounds

229
00:29:12,52 --> 00:29:21,25
but at a battlefield King John died in twelve sixteen. There are various stories about what killed him.

230
00:29:22,32 --> 00:29:31,95
One story that a lot of people seem to enjoy is that he died of dysentery from eating a surfeit peaches.

231
00:29:32,67 --> 00:29:37,13
You can make what you like of that but he didn't die in battle that's for sure.

232
00:29:38,54 --> 00:29:47,91
And his son Henry the third who was there nine years old. Six acceded to the throne.

233
00:29:49,37 --> 00:29:59,5
In twelve sixteen after John's death. There was a reissue of a kind of charter of liberties. But it didn't.

234
00:30:00,23 --> 00:30:07,95
Really take on. And in twelve seventeen when Henry the third was crowned.

235
00:30:07,97 --> 00:30:16,42
His advisers suggested that he should reissue the charter of liberties of twelve fifteen.

236
00:30:16,9 --> 00:30:26,67
As a sign of good faith as an undertaking to the population that he would comply with the laws and with the principles.

237
00:30:27,07 --> 00:30:38,67
And new document was created. And in twelve seventeen that new document was issued. And it was given a name.

238
00:30:38,68 --> 00:30:44,66
At the same time that it was issued the forest charter. Was issued.

239
00:30:45,75 --> 00:30:52,32
And the forest charter was a document that gave to the common people rights that had previously been exclusively

240
00:30:52,32 --> 00:30:59,68
enjoyed by the king. Forest lands hunting fishing. Crops grazing all that sort of thing.

241
00:31:00,53 --> 00:31:05,74
So this was a very significant concession was being made to the people and it was called the forest charter

242
00:31:05,74 --> 00:31:08,15
and it was quite a small document.

243
00:31:08,3 --> 00:31:14,24
Smaller than the other one that was issued in twelve seventeen and so to distinguish between the forest charter

244
00:31:14,24 --> 00:31:20,76
and the other document like all the other document. The Magna Carta.

245
00:31:20,77 --> 00:31:26,98
The big charter to be distinguished from the farce charter which was smaller.

246
00:31:27,98 --> 00:31:36,51
We have this idea of Magna Carta implying statements of great principle and importance statements of great moment.

247
00:31:38,12 --> 00:31:43,79
But it's actually a name that was given to because of its size just happened to be a bit bigger than the other one that

248
00:31:43,79 --> 00:31:49,84
was issued at the same time. Slightly deflating.

249
00:31:49,86 --> 00:31:59,84
So these charges were issued in twelve seventeen but they the Magna Carta and I'll call it that. As it became.

250
00:32:00,23 --> 00:32:06,31
And remained. Was not sixty three clauses anymore. It was thirty seven.

251
00:32:07,73 --> 00:32:13,72
It had been cut down and a lot of the provisions that were quite onerous for the King had been removed

252
00:32:15,24 --> 00:32:19,52
and you can compare the two versions and see the changes that have been made.

253
00:32:20,67 --> 00:32:21,53
Vases thirty nine

254
00:32:21,53 --> 00:32:31,63
and forty the two that are so important to notions of justice work condensed into cost twenty nine in the twelve

255
00:32:32,55 --> 00:32:35,81
seventeen making the car.

256
00:32:35,82 --> 00:32:44,34
And other concessions were made along the way that's the document then that we're really celebrating the twelve

257
00:32:44,34 --> 00:32:55,22
seventeen Magna Carta. And it has become it became the source of other. Real issues that happened.

258
00:32:55,24 --> 00:32:58,97
Through the thirteenth century.

259
00:32:59,94 --> 00:33:07,15
There were of course when these documents were made the scribes were making multiple copies of them to the one time.

260
00:33:07,59 --> 00:33:13,34
So they could be distributed to various places and read out. And.

261
00:33:14,86 --> 00:33:18,58
The population could get to know the contents of them.

262
00:33:20,06 --> 00:33:25,26
There were a number of reissues of this document over the thirteenth century.

263
00:33:25,27 --> 00:33:27,07
I won't go through all of them

264
00:33:27,07 --> 00:33:39,07
but the seminal document really becomes the twelve twenty five version which was then repeated in twelve ninety seven

265
00:33:40,76 --> 00:33:43,61
with one word different in Clause two.

266
00:33:43,92 --> 00:33:51,63
So you never got exact or you very rarely got exact copies of these documents being reproduced.

267
00:33:51,65 --> 00:33:59,46
But it's that document and what you will see quoted more commonly than the twelve fifteen document.

268
00:34:00,23 --> 00:34:08,48
Is the twelve ninety seven document which drew on the twelve twenty six document and became.

269
00:34:09,44 --> 00:34:19,47
The version that has been adopted for most practical purposes. Well the document. Has become.

270
00:34:21,21 --> 00:34:26,93
Since the thirteenth century. A source of inspiration for.

271
00:34:26,95 --> 00:34:35,58
Lawmakers for those seeking independence from colonial powers. For us.

272
00:34:37,03 --> 00:34:41,34
Crafting the laws and the basic principles under which we live.

273
00:34:41,36 --> 00:34:48,45
And I think it's important to remember that it's it's not so much the words of the document or the documents.

274
00:34:48,47 --> 00:34:49,4
That are important.

275
00:34:50,48 --> 00:35:01,03
It's the ideas behind the words that have come to be inspirational that have provided support that have provided the

276
00:35:01,04 --> 00:35:11,51
principles that we now apply really without too much second thought. And I'm just going to finish by identifying.

277
00:35:11,53 --> 00:35:21,34
The most probably the most important principles that we get from the Magna Carta from the charter of liberties before

278
00:35:21,34 --> 00:35:25,3
us from the documents that have come after.

279
00:35:27,01 --> 00:35:31,33
I don't know whether we're having another eight hundredth anniversary in twelve seventeen that will be interesting to

280
00:35:31,33 --> 00:35:46,51
see what happens. But it's really the source of the rule of law. In our system of government.

281
00:35:48,43 --> 00:35:56,18
And the role of law is a concept which. We could discuss for quite a long time so I'm not going to even start.

282
00:35:56,76 --> 00:36:00,18
But it doesn't mean rule by wall there are many quo.

283
00:36:00,23 --> 00:36:06,2
He's in the rule of law that need to be important for there to be a proper rule of law or fly.

284
00:36:06,5 --> 00:36:12,26
So that's just flag that so that you don't think that just because there is a war on something we have the rule of law.

285
00:36:12,39 --> 00:36:22,52
No it means a lot more than that. And the principles that I want to identify the continuation of basic law.

286
00:36:22,54 --> 00:36:28,24
Have a framework for order and peace fashioned by and from the people.

287
00:36:28,25 --> 00:36:34,54
Bear in mind that these documents were picking up on the good old laws of England that have been handed down through

288
00:36:34,54 --> 00:36:44,43
the generations and contemporary laws then my and rest upon this foundation of the basic law.

289
00:36:45,28 --> 00:36:52,43
The triumph of liberties over tyranny is one of the principles that we get from it.

290
00:36:52,45 --> 00:37:02,09
The rule of law itself as I said and particularly from the fact that nobody is above the law not even the monarch.

291
00:37:02,11 --> 00:37:06,1
But King John. For all his faults subscribed to this document.

292
00:37:06,88 --> 00:37:14,07
He did come to the table and agree even though he declined to perform his agreement.

293
00:37:15,51 --> 00:37:26,51
He recognized that he as the model code bind himself to the law. And he did so. We get from it.

294
00:37:26,54 --> 00:37:33,00
The value of democratic processes in the government of the people the involvement of the people in the formation of

295
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:43,2
laws. We get the value of the separation of powers. Between the executive the legislature and the judiciary.

296
00:37:43,67 --> 00:37:46,87
Principles that are vitally important to us today.

297
00:37:48,45 --> 00:37:49,16
The independence

298
00:37:49,16 --> 00:37:55,82
and professional competence of the judiciary there are clauses in the documents pointing to the need for properly

299
00:37:55,82 --> 00:38:02,92
trained professional law a Jew. Decatur's to be provided.

300
00:38:03,82 --> 00:38:11,98
We get equality before the law and due process before the law including the presumption of innocence.

301
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:18,51
The burden of proof being on the prosecution and other fundamental principles to criminal justice

302
00:38:18,51 --> 00:38:26,31
and they come from clauses in the documents. We get trial by a jury of one's peers.

303
00:38:27,03 --> 00:38:35,27
Yes it was already in place in a form but here it was stated and preserved and it has continued ever since

304
00:38:35,27 --> 00:38:41,6
or where the nature of the jury and the way in which it operates is changed very significantly since that time.

305
00:38:41,62 --> 00:38:51,53
We've got the basis of the principle that was inspirational to the American independence movement.

306
00:38:52,56 --> 00:39:02,13
No taxation without representation. And we get freedom from arbitrary punishment and proportionality in sentencing.

307
00:39:03,89 --> 00:39:09,19
So when you hear politicians talk about mandatory sentences. That's contrary to the Magna Carta.

308
00:39:09,45 --> 00:39:19,74
And that can be said with some confidence. It's also said to have been the origin of the lore of trusts.

309
00:39:19,76 --> 00:39:23,77
Very important aspect of our system.

310
00:39:23,79 --> 00:39:33,67
And finally it was actually the very beginning of the recognition of women's rights.

311
00:39:33,69 --> 00:39:44,03
All that time ago in this sense that widows would no longer be forced to remarry. People who were nominated for them.

312
00:39:44,88 --> 00:39:54,22
And they would be entitled to share in their inheritance and that was a pretty significant change for the time.

313
00:39:55,83 --> 00:40:01,95
So ladies and gentlemen I hope you can see that regardless of. Details of the history.
