1
00:00:04,33 --> 00:00:08,30
So what do you do if you want to go to
the toilet. Well you had the opportunity

2
00:00:08,30 --> 00:00:14,63
then of getting in that lift because it
wasn't crowded and not. A great number of

3
00:00:14,63 --> 00:00:20,27
men waiting around to get into that left
to be taken up top and. You could go down

4
00:00:20,27 --> 00:00:27,02
and do what you had to otherwise if the
lift was occupied. Well then it was

5
00:00:27,02 --> 00:00:32,21
a long process of getting down
the girders right back down to

6
00:00:32,93 --> 00:00:39,10
a level where. You could do
whatever you wish to. Think

7
00:00:41,25 --> 00:00:44,37
. Do you remember any amusing incidents
while you were working on the route.

8
00:00:48,67 --> 00:00:51,96
Well no particular items i think was

9
00:00:51,96 --> 00:00:58,84
a general feeling though of great comradeship
to monks all the people and. Most of

10
00:00:58,84 --> 00:00:59,72
the people had

11
00:00:59,72 --> 00:01:03,65
a great admiration for the other
fellows who were working on the bridge

12
00:01:03,65 --> 00:01:08,64
particularly i felt that the chaps who
have been doing the steel construction.

13
00:01:10,05 --> 00:01:10,87
We're doing such

14
00:01:10,87 --> 00:01:16,84
a wonderful job of. Dashing along girders
and jumping out onto her portion of metal

15
00:01:16,84 --> 00:01:23,23
. Supported by the crane which was popping
around in the air and just balancing it

16
00:01:23,23 --> 00:01:29,18
and taking it across and making sure that
it fitted in its position that it should

17
00:01:29,18 --> 00:01:35,29
have and i felt that. They just amazed me
all the way along to see how agile they

18
00:01:35,29 --> 00:01:41,97
were. And sure footed they were like
mountain goats. And i must say that i

19
00:01:41,98 --> 00:01:47,09
always felt there should be great praise
for those fellows what you feel about

20
00:01:47,10 --> 00:01:53,68
doormen long as an employer. Oh
i felt they were pretty good. I

21
00:01:53,69 --> 00:01:58,55
had no great complaint from them because
it was the general working conditions of

22
00:01:58,55 --> 00:02:04,64
the day that we were were having
there and generally of course.

23
00:02:05,13 --> 00:02:11,21
Conditions were pretty poor you could say
that most building jobs. There were no

24
00:02:11,21 --> 00:02:14,03
facilities if you wanted
a wash. There's usually

25
00:02:14,03 --> 00:02:20,53
a tap somewhere around where they put the
hose on where they were using this to

26
00:02:21,46 --> 00:02:26,70
do their concrete work or something of that
sort and most times you went home just

27
00:02:26,70 --> 00:02:31,11
as dirty as you were on the job because.
There is just nothing in the way of

28
00:02:31,11 --> 00:02:37,12
facilities and as for lunch rooms or anything
of that sort of course you just took

29
00:02:37,13 --> 00:02:42,88
your lunch up on the job with you. And you
had it wherever you were we had to try

30
00:02:42,88 --> 00:02:47,96
and get back to the road level.
And we'd sit there and have

31
00:02:47,96 --> 00:02:54,19
a look at sydney and enjoy the view and eat
our lunch up there and think about the

32
00:02:54,19 --> 00:02:58,06
things that were going to happen in the
future on that particular roadway in the

33
00:02:58,06 --> 00:03:02,87
traffic dashing through and so
on. And it altogether. It was

34
00:03:02,87 --> 00:03:09,40
a wonderful experience and i enjoyed
most every bit of it and i'd say that.

35
00:03:10,72 --> 00:03:11,10
It's

36
00:03:11,11 --> 00:03:17,70
a very pleasant memory to me to think back
over those days on the bridge. Did you

37
00:03:17,70 --> 00:03:23,29
get sick pay or holiday pay. No
there was no sick pay day pay

38
00:03:24,79 --> 00:03:26,40
. You just worked

39
00:03:26,40 --> 00:03:32,92
a certain number of hours and your on by
the hour. And you could be put off with an

40
00:03:32,92 --> 00:03:34,87
hour's notice so it was

41
00:03:34,87 --> 00:03:40,39
a precarious way of living because
at any moment money could run out on

42
00:03:40,39 --> 00:03:45,38
a job and. In the case of the
bridge of course there had been

43
00:03:45,38 --> 00:03:49,67
a lot of the fellows had been working
there for many years before. Why start to

44
00:03:49,67 --> 00:03:53,22
work on the bridge and they were in

45
00:03:53,23 --> 00:04:00,09
a settled condition because they had proved
their worth and they were continuing on

46
00:04:00,09 --> 00:04:01,80
the job but of course i was

47
00:04:01,80 --> 00:04:07,04
a newcomer towards the end of the
bridge and. They had no real

48
00:04:09,41 --> 00:04:13,32
reason for keeping me on because of
my experience on the bridge. I was

49
00:04:13,32 --> 00:04:19,36
a an absolute outsider at that stage but i
was gradually taken in with the all the

50
00:04:19,36 --> 00:04:21,35
others and got quite

51
00:04:21,35 --> 00:04:27,47
a nice little run on the bridge of work.
When did you finish up. I finished up

52
00:04:27,47 --> 00:04:34,43
before the actual roadway was
completed across the bridge.

53
00:04:34,45 --> 00:04:35,98
It came to

54
00:04:35,98 --> 00:04:41,96
a stage there where we were dependent
on cranes lifting our material up

55
00:04:43,07 --> 00:04:49,33
and if they were in use by the granite.
Stone masons. Well then we couldn't get

56
00:04:49,33 --> 00:04:54,94
a crane for our wood work and there came
times when it just became impossible for

57
00:04:54,94 --> 00:05:00,22
us to work so that at one stage
there as things were gradually

58
00:05:01,75 --> 00:05:08,23
going down in the way of. Construction
heavy construction was disappearing. It

59
00:05:08,23 --> 00:05:14,33
became evident that somebody was going to
go off and several of us were told that

60
00:05:15,23 --> 00:05:20,79
we would have to stand down which we did.
And i thought that was the end of it but

61
00:05:21,62 --> 00:05:26,56
. Unfortunately i didn't come back and play
again because i felt that the thing was

62
00:05:26,56 --> 00:05:28,69
tapering down and slowing down to

63
00:05:28,69 --> 00:05:34,33
a point where there wouldn't be any other
people put on but i found out later that

64
00:05:34,33 --> 00:05:40,48
they were looking for me and if i had shown
up. I would have had another job for oh

65
00:05:40,49 --> 00:05:47,09
for about six seven months which i was
very unhappy about this but it was

66
00:05:47,09 --> 00:05:51,96
the way of the employer at that time they
wouldn't get in touch with you had to get

67
00:05:51,96 --> 00:05:58,66
in touch with them. And that's the system
that was working and i just. Made the

68
00:05:58,66 --> 00:06:02,34
mistake of not keeping on.
And coming back again it's

69
00:06:02,35 --> 00:06:08,31
a lesson i learned in later life and i
didn't do that sort of thing again. So what

70
00:06:08,31 --> 00:06:13,27
happened to you then. Did you get a
job or will you go to work. I got

71
00:06:13,28 --> 00:06:20,04
a job after about three months
and i worked around sydney on

72
00:06:20,04 --> 00:06:25,32
some of the bigger buildings that were
going on around sydney and then that be

73
00:06:25,32 --> 00:06:32,07
a break. I found that the if you were not
very well known. And i wasn't very well

74
00:06:32,07 --> 00:06:36,01
known because i had finished an
apprenticeship with a firm which was

75
00:06:36,01 --> 00:06:41,56
a victim of that particular period and
gone out of business which firm was that

76
00:06:41,56 --> 00:06:42,19
that was

77
00:06:42,19 --> 00:06:48,95
a beall construction company. And
it meant then that. You didn't have

78
00:06:48,95 --> 00:06:52,65
people to go to where
you were known to get

79
00:06:52,65 --> 00:06:59,63
a job so i found that any big building
that was near completion. There

80
00:06:59,63 --> 00:07:04,71
are probably some thing on that building
that they want to get done and they'd put

81
00:07:04,71 --> 00:07:09,41
a few extra men on just for the finishing
touches but it always meant that you were

82
00:07:09,41 --> 00:07:15,16
on the finish and soon as you finished it
all you were out of work again. And that

83
00:07:15,16 --> 00:07:20,97
was the general scene at that
particular time. And after

84
00:07:20,98 --> 00:07:27,93
a few years of little jobs here and little
jobs there. I eventually went to work in

85
00:07:27,93 --> 00:07:34,25
a job where i was employed for thirty
five years so i was quite settled in that

86
00:07:34,25 --> 00:07:40,76
particular job. Before that were you ever
on the dole at any time. Well i i tried

87
00:07:40,76 --> 00:07:45,48
the dole. But i was a single man
and i was given seven and six

88
00:07:45,48 --> 00:07:51,00
a week. And i found that. That was quite

89
00:07:51,01 --> 00:07:57,64
a problem to do anything for the seven
and six and i used to follow the

90
00:07:57,64 --> 00:08:00,09
timber tracts. If i saw

91
00:08:00,09 --> 00:08:05,25
a timber truck going around. I know he was
going to some building site and if he

92
00:08:05,25 --> 00:08:10,72
didn't go too fast on my pushbike i wouldn't
be able to follow him and this is one

93
00:08:10,72 --> 00:08:12,91
way of following up to get

94
00:08:12,91 --> 00:08:19,61
a job. The the general conditions at that

95
00:08:19,61 --> 00:08:26,13
time there was of sorts of strife
strikes going on small strikes on

96
00:08:26,13 --> 00:08:29,71
jobs even though the conditions were
such that everybody is looking for

97
00:08:29,71 --> 00:08:36,36
a job there had to be some control over
the way people are doing it because

98
00:08:37,07 --> 00:08:43,29
. Only to the shortage of jobs. People
would try and put you on at less than the

99
00:08:43,29 --> 00:08:45,96
award rates and there was quite

100
00:08:45,96 --> 00:08:49,47
a bit of strife going on about
this. So having followed

101
00:08:49,47 --> 00:08:53,91
a timber truck out to one
job and going to apply for

102
00:08:53,91 --> 00:08:59,18
a job i found that it had been declared
black having peddled for miles because

103
00:08:59,19 --> 00:09:04,95
there was one of these arguments going on
with that particular builder. So after

104
00:09:04,96 --> 00:09:10,06
that. I wasn't so happy about following
every timber wagon that i got the

105
00:09:10,06 --> 00:09:16,99
opportunity to when you've got the dole
was it coupons. Yes it was coupons

106
00:09:17,71 --> 00:09:24,61
and the first thing we could go up to.
Just near the railway and central

107
00:09:24,61 --> 00:09:28,34
railway station and you'd put
you coupons in. And you get

108
00:09:28,34 --> 00:09:33,59
a sugar bag was. Low for
bread and dinner jam and

109
00:09:33,59 --> 00:09:40,52
a few things like that that. Later
on it became money and you could go

110
00:09:40,52 --> 00:09:47,07
down and pick up the money which seven and
six didn't do much either. When it was

111
00:09:47,07 --> 00:09:52,45
coupons only what did you used to cook
with. Well i was living at home with my

112
00:09:52,45 --> 00:09:58,55
mother at that time and other members of
the family and we used to cook on the gas

113
00:09:58,55 --> 00:10:03,90
of course but. I was fortunate that some
of the other members of the family of

114
00:10:03,90 --> 00:10:10,80
course were working. And we had to share
our resources. Yes the same thing would

115
00:10:10,80 --> 00:10:17,49
apply to rent i suppose. Yes this was.
In the case of in my particular case. My

116
00:10:17,49 --> 00:10:22,27
mother owned the house which was fortunate
but there were some terrible sets of

117
00:10:22,27 --> 00:10:29,06
circumstances. I remember at one
stage where we applied i applied

118
00:10:29,06 --> 00:10:35,47
for some assist some assistance and.
Inspector came out and just had

119
00:10:35,47 --> 00:10:40,49
a look at the house and said. Oh now you
can put partitions across these rooms

120
00:10:40,49 --> 00:10:47,35
there are large and let them. So
let us know when you do this and.

121
00:10:47,37 --> 00:10:51,16
If you have any trouble then we might be
able to assist you but it's back to you.

122
00:10:51,29 --> 00:10:56,27
You've got to do your own thing and some
people said to me that the fact that you

123
00:10:56,27 --> 00:10:58,25
that you are somebody in the family had

124
00:10:58,25 --> 00:11:04,63
a house or even furniture disqualified them
from getting the dole at all. Well this

125
00:11:04,63 --> 00:11:11,18
. This could be i know in my case. When
i went to apply for it. There were big

126
00:11:11,18 --> 00:11:16,15
hues on the walls that the key is where
the overseas terminal or just along from

127
00:11:16,15 --> 00:11:21,99
where the overseas terminal is now. And
you got in these queues. And when you got

128
00:11:21,99 --> 00:11:27,44
up to the table. It was generally at that
stage. They tell you you're in the wrong

129
00:11:27,44 --> 00:11:32,37
here. So having waited about two hours
to get there and with no information

130
00:11:33,37 --> 00:11:36,06
available until you got
to the table. It was

131
00:11:36,06 --> 00:11:42,99
a very disappointing situation. So then you
get in the correct. Queue. And at that

132
00:11:42,99 --> 00:11:46,28
stage they used to say
to me aright. Are you

133
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,28
a married man are you were
returned soldier married and with

134
00:11:52,28 --> 00:11:59,12
a family you know i'm not right now are
you single return so you know i'm not.

135
00:11:59,42 --> 00:12:02,26
Now what about are you

136
00:12:02,26 --> 00:12:08,12
a married man now. And they go through all
these details and they'd get it down to

137
00:12:08,12 --> 00:12:08,37
being

138
00:12:08,37 --> 00:12:16,22
a single man and they'd say well. That
means we can't do much for you. Do

139
00:12:16,23 --> 00:12:21,47
you have any money in the bank. Well
in during my apprenticeship. Which was

140
00:12:21,47 --> 00:12:24,22
a very poor money i had saved

141
00:12:24,23 --> 00:12:30,45
a bit and i presented my bank
book and they tell me then

142
00:12:30,45 --> 00:12:35,58
that's it then when you get rid of what
you've got in the bank you come back and

143
00:12:35,58 --> 00:12:41,11
say yes. How long does it take you to
get rid of what you heard and have been

144
00:12:41,11 --> 00:12:44,72
didn't they glow after about

145
00:12:45,98 --> 00:12:52,75
a month i was back on these queues
again and the queues they came right

146
00:12:52,75 --> 00:12:58,14
along the wharf out and into the street
and there was two or three queues and

147
00:12:58,14 --> 00:13:03,87
here's all these fellows waiting to go
along and what an experience. Do you

148
00:13:03,87 --> 00:13:06,75
remember those queues well the bridge was
still being built. While you were in work

149
00:13:06,75 --> 00:13:13,11
. No i don't because. At
that stage i suppose i was

150
00:13:13,11 --> 00:13:14,87
that it lated to get

151
00:13:14,87 --> 00:13:21,06
a job on the bridge.
And. Watching my my own

152
00:13:21,06 --> 00:13:27,59
benefit of. Staying in one piece. I didn't
have much thought. I'm afraid for the

153
00:13:27,59 --> 00:13:33,56
other poor fellows but. Hanging on up there
was the main thought i had each day.

154
00:13:33,57 --> 00:13:36,93
How did you get to work. Where did you live
in the days only working on the bridge

155
00:13:36,93 --> 00:13:42,52
. I lived it. At kingsford
it was then called south

156
00:13:42,52 --> 00:13:48,69
a randwick and i used to go in the tram to
the quay and then catch the ferry across

157
00:13:48,69 --> 00:13:54,48
to the north side of the bridge to work
there. One of the experiences that i might

158
00:13:54,48 --> 00:14:00,54
tell you there is. The only jobs that
were available when you're out of work at

159
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:05,13
that stage seemed to be coming through
government departments and they would be put

160
00:14:05,13 --> 00:14:11,09
in with any other jobs to the union but
you had to be at the union in the morning

161
00:14:11,09 --> 00:14:15,74
for the morning call on the book where you
were registered. And you also had to be

162
00:14:15,74 --> 00:14:21,94
there for the afternoon call. Now this
meant that the whole day was going to be

163
00:14:21,94 --> 00:14:28,72
spent in town and during my
unemployment period. I used to ride

164
00:14:28,72 --> 00:14:32,34
from south rendering up to kingsford on

165
00:14:32,34 --> 00:14:38,83
a pushbike leave my pushbike there at my
sister's house and then walk up to high

166
00:14:38,83 --> 00:14:44,80
street randwick which was the section and
get the tram to darlinghurst which was

167
00:14:44,80 --> 00:14:50,02
a bad top and so i think at that stage and
then walk down from darlinghurst down to

168
00:14:50,02 --> 00:14:56,33
the trades or to be there for the
morning call. The morning call

169
00:14:56,33 --> 00:15:03,03
over you would spend some time around
town used to go to the town hall and sing

170
00:15:03,03 --> 00:15:07,28
with all the others there the best things
in life for free. And all those sort of

171
00:15:07,28 --> 00:15:08,91
things and have

172
00:15:08,91 --> 00:15:13,58
a happy time in amongst all the stress
and probably have enough money for

173
00:15:13,58 --> 00:15:20,52
a church to cake or something of that
sort something big. Cheap fear lunch. It

174
00:15:20,52 --> 00:15:20,61
was

175
00:15:20,61 --> 00:15:26,52
a chester cake. Well some of the fellows
used to say it was. The sweepings after they

176
00:15:26,52 --> 00:15:26,90
had made

177
00:15:26,90 --> 00:15:32,20
a few plum puddings and things was pastry
under an over it. I never did find out

178
00:15:32,20 --> 00:15:38,84
but it did taste wonderful when you're
hungry. Hard times do you remember again

179
00:15:38,84 --> 00:15:42,02
when you were on the bridge. What did you
do in your spare time when you had money

180
00:15:42,02 --> 00:15:44,41
. Well i was

181
00:15:44,41 --> 00:15:51,38
a radio enthusiast and when i had any
money. It went into my radio hobby. And i

182
00:15:51,38 --> 00:15:57,61
was interested in radio amateur radio
transmitting and receiving and i was also

183
00:15:58,64 --> 00:16:05,36
the secretary of the local radio club. And
this was the main enjoyment that i got

184
00:16:05,36 --> 00:16:09,88
out of life at that particular time. You
didn't go to dances and such like an

185
00:16:09,88 --> 00:16:12,82
evening. No i found that that was

186
00:16:12,82 --> 00:16:18,42
a pretty expensive way of doing things
because. There are a lot of there's

187
00:16:18,42 --> 00:16:24,43
a lot of money needed to compete and when
you're going around dancing and that saw

188
00:16:24,43 --> 00:16:29,89
it it's amazing how much you can spend
and when you just do not have an income.

189
00:16:31,57 --> 00:16:36,51
You just couldn't do much. I found with my
radio pads. I could pull them all apart

190
00:16:36,51 --> 00:16:42,15
and rebuild them and having spent the money
on the first lot. I just built them and

191
00:16:42,15 --> 00:16:44,95
rebuilt them and every time i saw

192
00:16:44,95 --> 00:16:48,40
a radio paper. Most of the newspapers
of sydney at that time had

193
00:16:48,40 --> 00:16:52,67
a radio section in it. So you get that out
and you'd build up the latest set of the

194
00:16:52,67 --> 00:16:57,46
day and that would keep you going. And then
go around to the different radio clubs

195
00:16:57,46 --> 00:17:01,73
. You'd be invited in didn't
cost you anything. And they're

196
00:17:01,73 --> 00:17:06,39
a happy family of radio man and that
particular time is i was looking in the

197
00:17:06,39 --> 00:17:09,01
newspapers there and i saw
drawings of how to build

198
00:17:09,01 --> 00:17:14,42
a radio in the telegraph and all sorts of
odd funny. That's right. The telegraph

199
00:17:14,42 --> 00:17:14,61
had

200
00:17:14,61 --> 00:17:21,55
a lift out supplement with their radio section
at that time and most papers did because

201
00:17:21,55 --> 00:17:26,85
it was so popular at that stage. They
just come up from the crystal set days to

202
00:17:26,85 --> 00:17:31,41
valves that is and it was
a job that anybody who is

203
00:17:31,41 --> 00:17:37,88
a bit handy could do. And today of course
most of these things are bought ready

204
00:17:37,88 --> 00:17:39,73
built but we got

205
00:17:39,73 --> 00:17:43,66
a lot of fun out of building them up and
putting up different aerial vs and trying

206
00:17:43,66 --> 00:17:49,62
out different systems of long distance
communication the experimenters of that

207
00:17:49,62 --> 00:17:52,62
particular stage laid

208
00:17:52,63 --> 00:17:58,42
a foundation i think for future development
of. Particularly the high frequency

209
00:17:58,42 --> 00:18:05,31
radio bands and. It was i was fortunate
that i was mixed up in that i think

210
00:18:05,31 --> 00:18:06,90
i'd have gone crazy if i didn't have such

211
00:18:06,90 --> 00:18:13,57
a hobby rather because only last amusing
story that you might tell us. Yes i think

212
00:18:13,57 --> 00:18:17,72
one of the incidents that did happen
while i was working on the north through

213
00:18:17,72 --> 00:18:22,02
a bridge for norman along.
Was. Firstly we had

214
00:18:22,02 --> 00:18:28,90
a system of. On the office
at the ground level on

215
00:18:28,91 --> 00:18:35,83
the north side they had a big board on
the left hand side. And everybody had

216
00:18:35,83 --> 00:18:37,28
a disk that was hanging on

217
00:18:37,28 --> 00:18:44,04
a hook. And the procedure was to take that
this guy off and go over to the right

218
00:18:44,04 --> 00:18:48,61
hand side of the door this occurs on the
outside of the building. And place your

219
00:18:48,61 --> 00:18:55,41
desk there and they would know then that
you were on the job. Well one morning

220
00:18:56,56 --> 00:19:03,13
a chap arrived up top. To go into our work
gang and he had all these tennis players

221
00:19:03,13 --> 00:19:06,20
on and a cappy belonged to a i'm sorry

222
00:19:06,20 --> 00:19:12,63
a cricket club that's what it was and
he had all his gear on whites and so on

223
00:19:12,63 --> 00:19:13,84
and he'd been to

224
00:19:13,84 --> 00:19:19,47
a meeting. Apparently the night before and
it's gone through into the dough on and

225
00:19:19,48 --> 00:19:24,72
he was able to get across and take his
disguise and put it on the other side of the

226
00:19:24,72 --> 00:19:31,53
door get in the lift and go up but he
was quite shaky. So we thought that

227
00:19:31,53 --> 00:19:37,98
say he was still under the influence.
We'd better do something to safeguard

228
00:19:37,99 --> 00:19:43,68
him from falling off the bridge and also
so he couldn't cause any harm to the other

229
00:19:43,68 --> 00:19:48,99
fellows that are working there. So. He
was lowered into inside one of the big

230
00:19:48,99 --> 00:19:55,30
girders which were hollow. And he was in
an upright position near as left in there

231
00:19:55,30 --> 00:20:00,27
to sleep it off. As long as there is
necessary. Round about lunchtime i got him out

232
00:20:01,02 --> 00:20:01,41
and he was

233
00:20:01,41 --> 00:20:08,89
a book there and he started work but.
This is always been in my mind as an

234
00:20:08,90 --> 00:20:13,94
amazing thing that happened while i was
working on the bridge. So there we are now

235
00:20:13,94 --> 00:20:17,23
. Leave it at that. Thank you mr. Brown.
