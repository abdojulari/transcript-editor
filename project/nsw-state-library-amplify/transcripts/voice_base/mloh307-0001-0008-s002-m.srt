1
00:00:16,8 --> 00:00:30,92
Identification is session eight side and identification. And Frank actually joined us so we left.

2
00:00:30,94 --> 00:00:39,85
And we went from there to below and yeah. And we had a great time in alone yeah.

3
00:00:41,97 --> 00:00:50,39
And we didn't have to cook for so so much because we were welcomed. Different people who'd been to the system.

4
00:00:50,77 --> 00:00:56,34
And I was so proud to be able to take us into their house for a bowl of soup or whatever.

5
00:00:58,36 --> 00:01:06,24
And then someone say it happened it was Ellen said you know we're not awfully far from San Marino. And San Marino.

6
00:01:06,59 --> 00:01:13,16
Incidentally was independent It had its independent government although in Italy as you know if

7
00:01:13,97 --> 00:01:20,76
and they treasure I had a deli in the delegation that went to.

8
00:01:20,77 --> 00:01:31,08
And we arrived at the gates of the city because it is you know is just a city on a rock.

9
00:01:31,8 --> 00:01:33,71
And you have to through the gate to the city.

10
00:01:35,37 --> 00:01:46,1
We pulled up and we looked pretty been there and the man of the guy you know who I was sore from Australia.

11
00:01:46,19 --> 00:01:51,41
We were at Berlin at the first of all and he jumped out of the skin and he ran away

12
00:01:52,17 --> 00:01:57,7
and he came back with the Treasurer. And the man here.

13
00:01:57,72 --> 00:02:13,78
And the treasurer said Oh what a mutant did that then says an IT company. And the places we went up to the town.

14
00:02:13,8 --> 00:02:23,57
And how tell you we looked we didn't. Look. Extraordinary and wait.

15
00:02:23,58 --> 00:02:30,46
Been camping already for over two weeks and from nowhere.

16
00:02:31,06 --> 00:02:41,18
The town hall is filled with women who is right at the banquet table with a huge class and cooking takes place

17
00:02:41,18 --> 00:02:42,48
and wine for life.

18
00:02:43,86 --> 00:02:51,31
And we're told to sit at the table and eat and being welcomed and the mayor makes a great speech

19
00:02:51,31 --> 00:02:59,93
and the Treasurer makes a great speech and the Treasurer came up to me and he gave me a bowl of very that it will stay.

20
00:03:00,51 --> 00:03:04,49
And I have them to this day.

21
00:03:04,51 --> 00:03:12,2
So we had a wonderful time there and during the think it was like a banquet the food was very simple.

22
00:03:12,33 --> 00:03:24,71
But cooked by these women you know homemade pester. You wonderful you know round about the make plenty of time.

23
00:03:24,73 --> 00:03:35,73
I knew and god like it was heaven Heaven. So why Hine. There wasn't a lot but we had one.

24
00:03:36,77 --> 00:03:40,96
So then we moved from San Marino entrance and Marina to row.

25
00:03:41,57 --> 00:03:48,87
Frank is still being with us and acting as interpreter which is wonderful but she couldn't leave.

26
00:03:48,89 --> 00:03:55,5
She just couldn't leave us and she said when the time was ready. She'd get on a train and go back to you know.

27
00:03:56,84 --> 00:04:04,03
Well in Rome I was we were able to get to a proper bath house and have a clean up.

28
00:04:05,57 --> 00:04:12,74
And see Rome and we spent almost two weeks there once again like a permanent chemical it's became the.

29
00:04:18,48 --> 00:04:28,19
Then after a bit. I said well you know. Ellen said his boat was. The week before it was.

30
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:36,18
And we'd better not loiter too much. So I said I can't leave until I see Florence.

31
00:04:36,48 --> 00:04:45,25
So we hopped in the car and packed up all our goods and shackles all at bully beef and whatever was there

32
00:04:45,25 --> 00:04:53,52
and set off for Florence. And Florence was welcoming it was easier to camp closer to the city.

33
00:04:55,24 --> 00:05:15,26
And Florence with the drug trade. It was nice and so cozy. So we spent about a week in the gallery.

34
00:05:15,28 --> 00:05:25,1
And we'd made a lot of the talent for. So one day some of the students came to us. For breakfast.

35
00:05:26,91 --> 00:05:37,94
And I said you know because it was very little food in Italy and I said everything will be still today.

36
00:05:37,96 --> 00:05:44,23
There's going to be a strike and all of the workers will be marching.

37
00:05:44,25 --> 00:05:45,86
So you must come

38
00:05:45,86 --> 00:05:52,03
and get a good place where you can see it so they took us to a good place where we could see the match

39
00:05:53,12 --> 00:06:11,18
and the marchers left that. Well certainly in the north and I carried these long rods. In front of them and I have.

40
00:06:12,15 --> 00:06:37,00
Twelve a brace. And they apply. And. Quite a moving experience. Florence. Regrettably.

41
00:06:37,82 --> 00:06:40,85
I felt I would like to have gone back again.

42
00:06:42,65 --> 00:06:54,72
In the last six seven years or more since I've been there but I've been several times but the last time was.

43
00:06:54,74 --> 00:07:00,71
And I found it almost broke my heart to see what had happened to.

44
00:07:00,73 --> 00:07:15,04
You know to get into my punch punch you have to step over the. Well. It was very sad. So I said I don't want to see.

45
00:07:18,62 --> 00:07:27,19
It made me realize. Deeply entrenched drug trade. Anyhow.

46
00:07:27,63 --> 00:07:37,92
So we went back up to friends went to Cali and put the car on the back. On the ferry and went back to London.

47
00:07:38,57 --> 00:07:48,41
And so I stayed in London until the week before Christmas I think it was. But during that time.

48
00:07:48,43 --> 00:07:55,11
I think it was longer than. I have to check that. But during that time.

49
00:07:55,44 --> 00:08:15,82
I met up with friends from Melbourne and there was the Reverend Vicki was a person or two people and could I.

50
00:08:18,16 --> 00:08:22,98
An Austrian but he happened to be the private secretary for the Dean of Canterbury.

51
00:08:24,15 --> 00:08:32,54
Now I met the Dane in nineteen forty nine here in Sydney when he visited and so Kurt said to me one day.

52
00:08:33,21 --> 00:08:37,91
Look I'm sure I wouldn't be able to manage disappointed if you don't come down and see him.

53
00:08:39,34 --> 00:08:44,63
So we said Bush would never do you mean had married again to a woman who was a beautiful artist

54
00:08:45,64 --> 00:08:56,09
and he lit a studio who could be involved in running the place. And I had some servants who did that kind of thing.

55
00:08:56,16 --> 00:09:11,37
So once again. BLANCHE. And Blanche was just a little more untidy than we were. Alan.

56
00:09:11,39 --> 00:09:14,66
Accepted the invitation to go and visit on a Sunday

57
00:09:15,8 --> 00:09:24,91
and we were to go to Sunday I didn't spend the afternoon just going around Canterbury. Enjoying it.

58
00:09:25,09 --> 00:09:29,43
Then going to the early six o'clock service

59
00:09:29,43 --> 00:09:43,87
and then we'd go to tea is his what you call it with the latest something like that. So I said. As you know. We're all.

60
00:09:43,89 --> 00:09:56,92
And we have got to have to really think. And those days you couldn't go to church with. It will be gaps.

61
00:09:56,94 --> 00:10:01,87
Because you'll be sitting in the visitors seat. If you please in.

62
00:10:01,88 --> 00:10:09,68
Well we caught a picture I can tell you I had my you know the one that I had

63
00:10:09,68 --> 00:10:15,81
when the pope was leaving yet so I was OK and that was something I could file that very little.

64
00:10:16,47 --> 00:10:22,28
But they have this didn't have a head and I all borrowed the dean's wife so it's.

65
00:10:22,3 --> 00:10:32,57
Well I don't know what we looked like but then we got to. What it would and did he cut it.

66
00:10:33,52 --> 00:10:38,2
And of course he went only just been to China and he was telling us that.

67
00:10:38,22 --> 00:10:46,91
That's how we should all be living a little he knew. How do you want to do a trip like that. You only see.

68
00:10:46,93 --> 00:10:50,1
Their intellect you see what I want you to see.

69
00:10:50,12 --> 00:10:58,34
And I learnt that from my trip you know that train trip from about the area going up to Paris made me realize that it

70
00:10:58,34 --> 00:11:05,06
wasn't for one for the people who are divided economically. Anyhow.

71
00:11:05,08 --> 00:11:19,56
So the dean preached about the wonderful things in China. And then when back to London and the next day. It said. Elf.

72
00:11:19,63 --> 00:11:19,89
Dickey.

73
00:11:20,74 --> 00:11:31,05
Here in London was one of them very courageous Presbyterian ministers who put it on them to stand up for world peace

74
00:11:31,85 --> 00:11:35,76
and the banning of the atom bomb. And that was he.

75
00:11:35,78 --> 00:11:42,7
And he had about four other Protestant colleagues who stood up against.

76
00:11:42,72 --> 00:11:46,23
What they believed to be right and that was work for peace.

77
00:11:47,5 --> 00:11:58,93
So they said to me up to Sheffield and do a bit of preaching about peace and be very nice if you could go

78
00:11:58,93 --> 00:11:59,6
and give him a hand.

79
00:12:00,67 --> 00:12:11,95
Well I was one of the regular peace exponents getting up you know platform so what have you saying how nice to have you

80
00:12:11,95 --> 00:12:20,51
had a band and for the. To stop the manufacturing of ammunition. Well.

81
00:12:22,41 --> 00:12:28,46
Ellen gets the brain back this time cleaned up a car after a quick trip in Europe.

82
00:12:29,41 --> 00:12:31,13
And he said yes he'd be the driver

83
00:12:31,13 --> 00:12:38,77
and he'd take us up to Sheffield because he was very involved in the peace movement and we got in

84
00:12:38,77 --> 00:12:46,18
and we do so it was a Saturday we went up to shift the autumn when we arrived we had to go

85
00:12:46,18 --> 00:12:53,07
and we were going to be housed in the rectory and the local. Rector.

86
00:12:54,26 --> 00:13:01,46
Was considered a violent communist because he was involved in the peace movement right up to his neck

87
00:13:02,32 --> 00:13:05,85
and he used to go out on the street you know.

88
00:13:05,86 --> 00:13:15,22
Literature for peace and he said we were to go to his place we were going to stay there that night and we are high

89
00:13:15,22 --> 00:13:18,74
and experience.

90
00:13:18,76 --> 00:13:23,18
And his wife just took us in a group of lost children

91
00:13:25,14 --> 00:13:34,44
and food case I cannot tell you you couldn't stand up in the streets of London because a cute phone behind you

92
00:13:34,44 --> 00:13:36,35
immediately.

93
00:13:36,37 --> 00:13:42,88
So we took a whole lot of tin stuff out of the boot which had been left over from the trip to Europe

94
00:13:43,9 --> 00:13:48,59
and we took that in but had we not taken Haiti.

95
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:53,55
They were all going to we were all going to be fed on potato cakes

96
00:13:53,55 --> 00:14:00,99
and I remember the huge wooden table in the kitchen to the our few servants around the place they were.

97
00:14:01,13 --> 00:14:06,47
And they were all in big balls measuring the boiled potatoes.

98
00:14:06,49 --> 00:14:15,81
And they had two wks and they were putting IGS into the potato cakes you know and making cakes for our two.

99
00:14:16,25 --> 00:14:21,14
Well when we added that in staff it made it great truly.

100
00:14:21,78 --> 00:14:29,9
But we had to wait for the main to come so well why did for the moment. Alan said let's go for a walk and we.

101
00:14:34,25 --> 00:14:46,7
Truly open to the hardship of the minus and it as I said to us. This is but they have. So some who are coming.

102
00:14:46,86 --> 00:14:48,91
Some of the leading miners who are coming.

103
00:14:49,31 --> 00:14:53,27
We all want to have a bath before they come Saturday night but I have

104
00:14:54,52 --> 00:14:57,05
but you couldn't see the houses so what you're suggesting like

105
00:14:57,05 --> 00:15:06,63
and all the steps to the house you know two steps where why quashed white painted white. So you could see that state.

106
00:15:08,28 --> 00:15:18,68
And they were common but the people waited and I would sit around waiting for that. And.

107
00:15:19,44 --> 00:15:24,81
It was extremely depressing coming from places like Australia.

108
00:15:24,83 --> 00:15:37,48
Where everything was so bright and cheerful even after the war the colors were bright and cheerful. Rist. All right.

109
00:15:38,72 --> 00:15:47,56
OK so we had one tap and some of the leaders of the miners union came and joined us for tea.

110
00:15:48,77 --> 00:16:02,28
With the potato cakes and all this. Feed the first. And she had also made beautiful Johnny cakes just went.

111
00:16:03,85 --> 00:16:10,3
And we stayed there and we had a very big meeting with the miners that night and they.

112
00:16:10,32 --> 00:16:18,11
And their children and they all said we've had it with you know what. We've had it now. Country.

113
00:16:18,12 --> 00:16:23,73
They were a very progressive very progressive political that I knew the answers

114
00:16:23,73 --> 00:16:28,43
and it wouldn't surprise me if at that time they didn't know about the row.

115
00:16:29,89 --> 00:16:36,47
Because there was always doubt in the minds of the English people whom I knew about his worth. So.

116
00:16:36,97 --> 00:16:45,92
And then we went back to London and in London. I went back to this lovely hotel.

117
00:16:46,97 --> 00:17:00,47
It was a better a five minute walk to the what do they call the underground troupe to the to. And.

118
00:17:00,49 --> 00:17:07,8
Being in London and I didn't want to see anything that had been bombed and had enough of that. So an awful lot of.

119
00:17:08,35 --> 00:17:16,82
What was and I will consider all I brought to the ground in England doesn't matter.

120
00:17:16,88 --> 00:17:23,62
And yes it comes Coventry and having seen that house it you know I've had enough.

121
00:17:23,64 --> 00:17:33,88
So I'm going to see land and the place on it and the opera was beginning to function again in a small way.

122
00:17:33,94 --> 00:17:43,67
I remember correctly because from where I was staying. I could walk to cover. But I spent a lot of time.

123
00:17:43,69 --> 00:17:53,76
It's still my heart I mean I couldn't be bothered going near the place now than I mean it.

124
00:17:53,78 --> 00:17:59,47
They don't sell of violets there they used to sell personality. Absolutely.

125
00:17:59,66 --> 00:18:06,3
And you could come out of an early opera and go into your weekend shopping right there with good fresh vegetables ep

126
00:18:06,3 --> 00:18:13,65
and all of the opera house practically so and the atmosphere is girl. You know it's not there anymore.

127
00:18:13,66 --> 00:18:21,07
So I went back up there. He left to come back to Australia.

128
00:18:21,09 --> 00:18:26,71
I do you know why in all I think about seven months or something like that

129
00:18:27,77 --> 00:18:44,65
and I would not for one minute was I ever homesick. Not at all and. Beautiful and English.

130
00:18:44,66 --> 00:18:49,4
And travelling on the same but it is me it was Frank

131
00:18:49,4 --> 00:18:56,24
and Ross Harvey that was the any bet they could get on to come home and they were lucky to get around it

132
00:18:57,18 --> 00:19:12,22
and so we came home had a cabin. And I shared the cabin with Shirley and Ruth. I would just Surely you know.

133
00:19:12,67 --> 00:19:25,36
It was very comfortable the food was absolutely. Cooked until it was awful revolting. But nothing like that mattered.

134
00:19:25,72 --> 00:19:27,37
You know.

135
00:19:27,39 --> 00:19:30,61
Going to have a bloody good on the ballot and we did

136
00:19:30,61 --> 00:19:38,4
and there were quite a few of the delegates on the trip coming back so we entertained he other passengers.

137
00:19:38,41 --> 00:19:47,2
Played games and did all the things you do for six weeks at sea and they came back. And.

138
00:19:47,22 --> 00:19:52,97
I thought it was wonderful going into the harbor.

139
00:19:52,99 --> 00:20:00,72
But you know we had one and they're coming in at six in the morning in the little tags coming out to pull us in

140
00:20:01,75 --> 00:20:08,06
and say you know for just beautiful. I would do any more this morning. I think.
