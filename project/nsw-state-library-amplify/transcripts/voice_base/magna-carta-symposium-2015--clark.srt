00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,25
Alex spake is Professor David Clarke David is a professor of law at Flinders University

2
00:00:07,37 --> 00:00:10,41
and has published papers on Magna Carta since the two thousand.

3
00:00:10,95 --> 00:00:15,65
He recently wrote a book for a book published by the very comparison

4
00:00:16,69 --> 00:00:23,76
and will present a piper to special senate seminar on the charter Tiber this work is part of a long term interest in

5
00:00:23,76 --> 00:00:26,04
key constitutional highlights.

6
00:00:26,61 --> 00:00:32,77
In particular he writes about the way in which inherited constitutional rights months have been transformed by the

7
00:00:32,77 --> 00:00:38,92
modern low and his. Topic today is Magna Carta in a strike.

8
00:00:38,96 --> 00:00:50,29
I think straight twenty fifteen the power of a myth and an idea place welcome to him. Thanks.

9
00:00:50,31 --> 00:00:54,33
Or I will thank you very much. I'd like to thank the history Council for inviting me.

10
00:00:55,47 --> 00:01:02,13
On something of a tour to rezone and will cover grounds and some interior dealt with by colleagues earlier.

11
00:01:02,63 --> 00:01:04,66
But I thought it might be useful to start.

12
00:01:05,07 --> 00:01:14,05
By looking at the proposition I wish to advance which is the main the card has survived by being changed.

13
00:01:14,07 --> 00:01:20,15
If it merely been simply a static medieval document we wouldn't be talking about very much.

14
00:01:20,2 --> 00:01:26,67
Today in a country which remember. Was not known to Europe in thirty in the thirteenth century.

15
00:01:26,69 --> 00:01:31,5
So the question of course is how is it that we've come to look at this document this way.

16
00:01:31,55 --> 00:01:38,06
Well the answer quickly and I should say to demonstrate that this is true transformation.

17
00:01:38,41 --> 00:01:44,9
And it was a transformative doctrine why from the beginning as we've heard from Nicholas in particular in the

18
00:01:44,9 --> 00:01:46,61
thirteenth century there were essentially.

19
00:01:47,24 --> 00:01:54,71
A number of agreements struck as we know it didn't survive very long a benign weeks initially

20
00:01:55,81 --> 00:02:04,11
and then of course it was reissued. Twice as we've heard. And one I want to mention because no one has so far.

21
00:02:04,49 --> 00:02:09,52
At the end of the twelve sixteen there was a special Magna Carta for Holland.

22
00:02:09,99 --> 00:02:15,12
And it's available by the way on Irish websites. So I was adapting the English document.

23
00:02:15,33 --> 00:02:20,76
So I ran for instead of referring to the English Church being free said the Irish Church will be free.

24
00:02:20,89 --> 00:02:24,98
Instead of referring to the liberties of London referred to the liberties of Dublin.

25
00:02:25,3 --> 00:02:31,52
Said referring to English rivers that refer to the River Liffey and of course it listed the Irish barons

26
00:02:31,52 --> 00:02:35,65
and by the way that document still part of Irish law.

27
00:02:36,43 --> 00:02:40,11
It we've heard it became a statute in twelve twenty five and twelve ninety seven

28
00:02:40,11 --> 00:02:46,44
and this is why it's actually quite important because they stepped three versions have remained part of the law in

29
00:02:46,44 --> 00:02:48,75
England and in the States

30
00:02:49,55 --> 00:02:56,56
and it's with looking at that the English of course while they're celebrating the Magna Carta this year is an enormous

31
00:02:56,56 --> 00:02:58,52
exercise in tourism in the U.K.

32
00:02:58,52 --> 00:03:06,54
Right now with that sentimental about Magna Carta because in one thousand sixty three onwards they repealed most of the

33
00:03:06,54 --> 00:03:12,45
terms of a twelve ninety seven statute and three substantive changes chapters

34
00:03:12,45 --> 00:03:17,76
and they're actually called chapters not because the original document as you know it was

35
00:03:17,76 --> 00:03:22,29
and we've seen an example over here was in continuous Latin prose with no subdivisions

36
00:03:22,29 --> 00:03:28,5
but in the eighteenth century William Blackstone the great English lawyer produced a critical edition

37
00:03:28,5 --> 00:03:36,97
and he introduced the idea of divisions into chapters and that spin the convention in a sense.

38
00:03:36,99 --> 00:03:42,09
So the three that remain as part of English or is the proposition English law of English Church will be free

39
00:03:42,09 --> 00:03:46,03
and we've heard from Nicholas what the context was it has nothing to do with freedom of religion.

40
00:03:46,48 --> 00:03:53,75
They had the idea that the appointment of a possible figures in the English Church would be in the hands of the church

41
00:03:53,75 --> 00:03:59,95
and not in the hands of the king the other one that remains the liberties of London. Obviously not everybody.

42
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,06
Things applied to a stranger on the other hand the one that one talks about

43
00:04:05,06 --> 00:04:14,5
and I thought you might like to see the text is Chapter twenty on it's quite an elaborate set of sentences it combines

44
00:04:14,5 --> 00:04:20,95
two of the chapters from twelve fifteen name is chapters thirty nine and forty inside here modifies the language.

45
00:04:21,78 --> 00:04:23,57
So the word delay in Chapter forty.

46
00:04:24,17 --> 00:04:29,66
After twelve fifteen doesn't actually appear in twelve to twelve ninety seven edition.

47
00:04:29,92 --> 00:04:36,17
But everyone agrees that the notion of delay is implicit in this language will say in a moment.

48
00:04:36,51 --> 00:04:40,26
It refers to things which we no longer have in the law

49
00:04:40,26 --> 00:04:47,69
and generally these Take the phrase by lawful judgment of his peers sometimes wrongly thought to mean jury trial.

50
00:04:48,72 --> 00:04:54,14
Jury isn't mentioned in the document that we've heard that juries of a form existed at the time

51
00:04:54,88 --> 00:05:00,09
but the language of course continued to be used for many centuries why.

52
00:05:00,53 --> 00:05:04,58
Well there are various ways in which is transmitted down to it's not just as a statute.

53
00:05:06,14 --> 00:05:10,93
Up to fourteen eighty five there were periodic complaints about breaches of Magna Carta

54
00:05:10,93 --> 00:05:17,44
and the Kings sure Jews during the St centuries would simply issue commissions of inquiry.

55
00:05:17,46 --> 00:05:23,62
To see if breaches actually occurred. These in the various parliamentary roles and documents.

56
00:05:24,2 --> 00:05:27,75
It's been reaffirmed numerous times in English acts of parliament

57
00:05:27,75 --> 00:05:35,26
and is often if you look at the old statute books common in every state choose simply to reaffirm the charter

58
00:05:35,26 --> 00:05:45,5
and then go on to make. The latest legislation. Quiet during the times are actually the lawyers are interested in it.

59
00:05:46,68 --> 00:05:54,3
There's a practice of legal education whereby readings meaning elections were given by senior barristers at the ends of

60
00:05:54,3 --> 00:05:59,95
court. And a reading essentially was an exposition and analysis of an act meant. And there.

61
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,57
Quite a few readings on Magna Carta right through this period

62
00:06:03,57 --> 00:06:13,5
and in fact the Selden society which publishes publish legal material in England is producing a special volume this

63
00:06:13,5 --> 00:06:17,79
year on these readings to do with making a counter.

64
00:06:18,56 --> 00:06:25,89
But the great change occurred in the seventeenth century because the great Jacobean lawyer and parliamentarian

65
00:06:25,89 --> 00:06:31,64
and he was a suite of the House of Commons at one stage as well said would cook it is pronounced coke.

66
00:06:32,32 --> 00:06:37,14
We know that because the spelling was different in their time

67
00:06:37,14 --> 00:06:42,65
and we also know that the part of Norfolk from which he came in was pronounced coke

68
00:06:42,65 --> 00:06:44,73
when one said to tell students this.

69
00:06:45,34 --> 00:06:53,67
It's got nothing to do with Coca-Cola he published a series of famous lawbook which was from Italy boring.

70
00:06:54,07 --> 00:06:58,54
But used for many centuries called the Institute of the laws of England.

71
00:06:58,56 --> 00:07:02,8
And his second Institute starts off with a long chapter on Magna Carta.

72
00:07:03,1 --> 00:07:08,79
And he explains that it was the route to which all liberties in England grew.

73
00:07:09,39 --> 00:07:13,99
And so what we have here is a transformation from medieval liberties

74
00:07:13,99 --> 00:07:20,27
and grievances most of which are even by his time passed into history into the notion of

75
00:07:20,27 --> 00:07:26,43
and we've heard earlier from John. And his speech of the liberties of the free born Englishman.

76
00:07:26,71 --> 00:07:34,57
Which is a phrase used in political argument and discourse both by lawyers and non lawyers in the seventeenth century.

77
00:07:34,59 --> 00:07:36,51
And.

78
00:07:37,37 --> 00:07:45,98
We come to Australia three of the states actually have including New South Wales Imperial acts application legislation

79
00:07:45,98 --> 00:07:54,11
which essentially lists for their jurisdiction the various constitutional legislation from England which is part of the

80
00:07:54,11 --> 00:07:59,12
jurisdiction and all of these three wells that are in Queensland.

81
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,68
Up to twenty nine is still part of the formal law of the jurisdiction. The other three states didn't do that.

82
00:08:06,86 --> 00:08:15,38
It's been recommended so their case Magna Carta came along with all other English statutes on civil mint.

83
00:08:15,96 --> 00:08:22,9
And they had a reception date systems as they have a strike which is where I'm from the reception date is the twenty

84
00:08:22,9 --> 00:08:29,04
eighth of December eighteenth eighty six point any English and is a remember in English statute.

85
00:08:29,28 --> 00:08:33,29
It's not a Scottish date chewed it was never part of Scottish law.

86
00:08:33,82 --> 00:08:39,96
As a rather crabby memorandum from a Scottish Law Society pointed out to the House of Commons in two thousand

87
00:08:39,96 --> 00:08:40,87
and seven.

88
00:08:41,14 --> 00:08:47,86
Because I was being asked are you going to celebrate Magna Carta in the Scots said no it's an English act

89
00:08:48,69 --> 00:08:53,72
and of course English Scottish lawyers from the seventeenth century on it made their point.

90
00:08:55,33 --> 00:08:55,46
So

91
00:08:55,47 --> 00:09:01,32
and their case of these other jurisdictions in all the states is automatically becomes part of the law of jurisdiction.

92
00:09:02,39 --> 00:09:07,03
Now the problem of course with a medieval statute was this court of medieval languages.

93
00:09:07,26 --> 00:09:12,79
Hey are you going to make it work in a modern context and the answer is I need my being adapted.

94
00:09:13,41 --> 00:09:19,61
And there are various ways of adapting it but what I want to do deal with a number of misconceptions about it.

95
00:09:19,7 --> 00:09:27,00
There are arguments and make the kinds of mentioned dozens of times in step cases in this country.

96
00:09:27,7 --> 00:09:34,42
There is a superior constitutional instrument against which to measure the villainy or all other straight

97
00:09:34,42 --> 00:09:36,3
and they just Station. This is wrong.

98
00:09:37,21 --> 00:09:42,81
The high court slate that idea in a case involving a Chinese person in one thousand nine hundred five

99
00:09:43,62 --> 00:09:47,51
when that sort of argument was raised and it keeps being raised again.

100
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:52,8
I'll give you one quick musing story nine hundred eighty six and that

101
00:09:52,8 --> 00:09:59,95
but can't in where else Queensland try to disqualify his rivals in a parliamentary election by sea.

102
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:07,19
I think that maybe the Canada only authorized currency in the form of coins since his opponents had all paid

103
00:10:07,19 --> 00:10:13,05
parliamentary deposits of checks or Visa cards it's a trap. They should be disqualified.

104
00:10:13,34 --> 00:10:16,93
And he of course will get a free run now. Justice.

105
00:10:16,96 --> 00:10:21,47
Wilson who heard this case it was an application not the full bench

106
00:10:21,47 --> 00:10:27,73
and the High Court threw it out by pointing out that maybe the counter like any other inherited state you can be

107
00:10:27,73 --> 00:10:28,00
modified

108
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:35,42
and changed by valid Australian IT JUST lation And obviously that would include valid Australian education on currency.

109
00:10:35,73 --> 00:10:40,5
He didn't deal with the obvious other practical point that if this man had been for rate.

110
00:10:40,83 --> 00:10:42,77
How do you pay for a six hundred thousand dollars.

111
00:10:43,07 --> 00:10:49,81
Hells with a truckload of two dollar coins because the logic of his argument is that there's been no movement in

112
00:10:49,82 --> 00:10:51,86
financial arrangements since the thirteenth century

113
00:10:52,7 --> 00:10:58,71
and clearly you couldn't run a modern economic system just by tossing coins around.

114
00:10:58,73 --> 00:11:06,66
It may be modified by an Australian Parliament and may actually be superseded by later legislation

115
00:11:06,66 --> 00:11:12,86
but there are several missed the greatest myth because it's just the systems and currency is that was signed.

116
00:11:13,29 --> 00:11:18,74
I regret to say that when I first got the advertisement for this. Session.

117
00:11:19,05 --> 00:11:23,43
I was told in the advertising it was something about signing the making the car.

118
00:11:23,44 --> 00:11:27,67
I hope that's been erased the king probably couldn't write.

119
00:11:27,69 --> 00:11:30,32
That's what his body biography suggest

120
00:11:30,32 --> 00:11:36,93
but as we know from the four surviving call of copies three have seals attached one doesn't

121
00:11:36,93 --> 00:11:40,43
but it does have a hole in the vellum. Where the code would have gone.

122
00:11:40,9 --> 00:11:45,92
And that was established by an English historical caller in. One hundred twenty four.

123
00:11:46,31 --> 00:11:49,1
And there are of course in the strains of understood this.

124
00:11:49,2 --> 00:11:54,51
So in these famous debates in the sixty's in the Commonwealth Parliament I think it was God's will

125
00:11:54,51 --> 00:12:02,51
and he noticed that the counter had been of course speed. Sealed not signed.

126
00:12:02,59 --> 00:12:08,56
Now I mention that because last year I write a very crappy piece online called a confederacy of dunces

127
00:12:09,7 --> 00:12:15,76
and was a bear an examination of the high school textbooks in this history textbooks in Australia which cover Magna

128
00:12:15,76 --> 00:12:21,85
Carta and almost all of them saying there was a lot of signing going on. I had to say that it's totally false.

129
00:12:24,07 --> 00:12:26,55
It tells us something about the writers perhaps.

130
00:12:26,57 --> 00:12:32,99
So although I agree we should be trying to fuse knowledge of the rule of law and constitutional inheritance.

131
00:12:33,31 --> 00:12:38,03
It is rather important to be accurate. And not fanciful.

132
00:12:38,05 --> 00:12:44,36
Secondly tells Arjun jury trials were heard the juries of the time didn't exist in the form we have now

133
00:12:45,2 --> 00:12:51,75
and then we actually in the later in any case there were jury isn't mentioned it does say a jury of one's peers

134
00:12:51,75 --> 00:12:57,56
but at the time and later they came to mean a special jury for the arest credits

135
00:12:57,56 --> 00:13:04,19
or peers who had to be judged by other peers and that was a principle that remained in English law until removal

136
00:13:04,19 --> 00:13:09,2
and nine hundred forty eight. The last trial like that incredibly was nine hundred thirty three.

137
00:13:10,53 --> 00:13:17,36
That was a script which they were I would point to make an account or a source as an origin behaviors corpus.

138
00:13:17,76 --> 00:13:21,03
I've written to monographs about this. I sort of know about it.

139
00:13:21,99 --> 00:13:28,45
But it's my advertising that very simply made corpus as a turn predated making account of their references

140
00:13:28,45 --> 00:13:33,73
and twelve hundred six and twelve fourteen. So could have been created by Magna Carta.

141
00:13:34,25 --> 00:13:39,53
And in the form in which we use corpus and they used to be six forms of the writ.

142
00:13:40,87 --> 00:13:47,85
Don't really comes into its own in the sixteen. Seventies and Eighties. So maybe the Carter didn't create that either.

143
00:13:49,47 --> 00:13:51,74
As an origin of human rights.

144
00:13:51,75 --> 00:13:56,27
Well the term human rights interestingly enough an interesting which language in the sixteenth twenties.

145
00:13:57,78 --> 00:13:59,8
Was widely used in nineteenth century.

146
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:00,34
Strayer

147
00:14:01,15 --> 00:14:08,63
and thanks to the fabulous National Library digitalisation program you can look at all the national newspapers free of

148
00:14:08,63 --> 00:14:08,7
charge

149
00:14:09,72 --> 00:14:15,79
and I invite you to do so if you've never done it you just write intro into Google it takes you to the National Library

150
00:14:15,79 --> 00:14:22,6
site. And the digital newspaper collection. It's a source now for historical works.

151
00:14:22,76 --> 00:14:28,29
And so the phrase human rights appears in Sydney newspaper in one thousand nine hundred nineteen.

152
00:14:28,77 --> 00:14:31,14
But it didn't exist then as we know

153
00:14:31,14 --> 00:14:37,55
and I think there's some discussion one of the questions about this human rights are generally thought to be universal

154
00:14:37,55 --> 00:14:45,97
and character ought to be and the right course in the way it was in the basis of parliamentary democracy either.

155
00:14:46,44 --> 00:14:53,09
As Robert Menzies pointed out in the speech to which Rosemary made reference earlier he actually said the Barents

156
00:14:53,09 --> 00:15:00,55
when sending out a democracy or anything like it. And it's not the foundation of the rule of law or either.

157
00:15:00,57 --> 00:15:04,59
It doesn't mean we don't have the rule of law and it doesn't mean that made the car or isn't important

158
00:15:04,59 --> 00:15:07,74
but think about the word foundation it's a building term.

159
00:15:08,15 --> 00:15:11,57
So I want to build a builds a building they lay the foundations.

160
00:15:11,69 --> 00:15:18,6
They know they are cold foundations because I go on to complete the rest of the building the Baron's didn't say in the

161
00:15:18,6 --> 00:15:24,29
meadow at Runnymede let's create the foundations for a legal system in a country we don't know exists

162
00:15:25,00 --> 00:15:32,52
and for ideas that haven't yet come into existence some hundreds of years in the future they did of course hope it was

163
00:15:32,52 --> 00:15:40,35
a very medieval idea that Magna Carta would be perpetual and last forever. Of course we know for a few weeks.

164
00:15:41,64 --> 00:15:47,53
So one of the things I didn't know about but which have subsequently emerged often the name of Magna Carta

165
00:15:47,53 --> 00:15:55,04
but didn't exist in the thirteenth century Well federalism. Judicial independence.

166
00:15:55,06 --> 00:15:59,71
Knickers mentioned the references to judges and there was a vision of a judge.

167
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,43
Do you just believe in eighty's and there's a. Medieval scholarship.

168
00:16:05,53 --> 00:16:11,93
On that judicial independence as a legal concept didn't emerge in the English model seven hundred with the Act of

169
00:16:11,93 --> 00:16:18,96
Settlement and we didn't actually start operating until seventeen fourteen and wasn't the doctrine in Australia

170
00:16:18,96 --> 00:16:26,24
when Australian courts were set up because judges have offices. Pleasure..

171
00:16:22,46 --> 00:16:28,61
They didn't have independence there and he came in and the eight hundred fifty S. Separation of powers.

172
00:16:28,71 --> 00:16:33,18
Well this is an idea emerges in the eighteenth century and I we're going to sociate it's with.

173
00:16:33,19 --> 00:16:34,73
The French right I'm on to skeer.

174
00:16:35,89 --> 00:16:39,84
And his book The Spirit of laws in seven hundred forty eight but actually he got the idea

175
00:16:39,84 --> 00:16:46,06
and conversation with English writers after a trip to England in Sydney in twenty eight.

176
00:16:46,08 --> 00:16:52,77
And of course there's no separation of powers in a medieval kingdom simply because in part.

177
00:16:53,16 --> 00:16:59,08
There wasn't a proper parliament yet so the king was and censure legislator as well as an executive.

178
00:16:59,1 --> 00:17:05,17
Universal suffrage and secret ballot Well these are of phenomena of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

179
00:17:05,19 --> 00:17:11,54
Nobody the ordinary people didn't have a vote is no there was a system of medieval elections believe it or not

180
00:17:12,54 --> 00:17:18,21
but it wasn't based on universal That's the key word suffrage and of course a secret ballot.

181
00:17:19,41 --> 00:17:25,72
Which Australia has a notable role in its creation and the fusion didn't exist in either.

182
00:17:26,34 --> 00:17:30,79
Religious toleration Well that didn't exist because there was only one church

183
00:17:30,79 --> 00:17:36,69
and heretics of course were dealt with severely. Equality before the law.

184
00:17:36,81 --> 00:17:44,17
Well in a hierarchical society where there were serfs. You don't have a quality you have inequality.

185
00:17:44,19 --> 00:17:50,12
Nevertheless these are things which we have course come to acquire in the course of the history

186
00:17:50,88 --> 00:17:55,58
and this is the transformation of making a counter not from a medieval document

187
00:17:55,58 --> 00:17:59,61
but into a series of key constitutional ideas.

188
00:18:00,84 --> 00:18:08,17
And right now actually tonight Pope rained extinguish medieval historian in English law giving a lecture in Adelaide

189
00:18:08,17 --> 00:18:12,23
which I will miss but he is also giving lectures elsewhere in the country

190
00:18:12,23 --> 00:18:15,87
and he wrote an entry in an encyclopedia a couple of years ago

191
00:18:16,65 --> 00:18:24,53
when he made that observation of this shift from particular English liberties in the thirteenth century to the idea of

192
00:18:24,53 --> 00:18:27,22
the constitutional values.

193
00:18:27,24 --> 00:18:32,23
So I say it's often raised by litigants really whom are terribly eccentric

194
00:18:33,01 --> 00:18:38,57
and I just mentioned made a counter they refer to the Book of Genesis and have a very sour things.

195
00:18:39,16 --> 00:18:43,26
Judges are amazingly patient when they hear these arguments by the way.

196
00:18:43,86 --> 00:18:50,88
Sometimes it's been the death it so you know just the word peers in chapter twenty nine where in a case in nine hundred

197
00:18:50,88 --> 00:18:51,45
eighty nine.

198
00:18:51,84 --> 00:19:00,36
An Aboriginal man in Queensland say well I want to a jury of my Aboriginal peers you want an Aboriginal jury.

199
00:19:00,79 --> 00:19:10,68
And justice. MacPherson is a very distinguished judge from Queens and also a noted writer on legal history.

200
00:19:10,7 --> 00:19:16,67
Point they have the word Piers has to mean and straight in context fellow citizens.

201
00:19:16,77 --> 00:19:25,14
So one way of making Medicare to work in the modern context is reinterpret the language to fit their present situation.

202
00:19:25,16 --> 00:19:32,46
It's also seen as a value in the legal system. And what are these values Well here's three of them.

203
00:19:32,47 --> 00:19:38,68
And it's not an exhaustive list and I was of mentioned some of these other values that is if it is banned by the law.

204
00:19:39,25 --> 00:19:42,4
The King of course made the promises and twelve fifteen.

205
00:19:42,92 --> 00:19:48,25
Other of course he was to gain has been broken connivance with the pope

206
00:19:49,14 --> 00:19:55,17
and kings for many centuries thereafter took the view that parts of the law particularly what was called the

207
00:19:55,17 --> 00:19:59,85
corroborative cannot be questioned in any court. And it was much.

208
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,72
Later we get the idea should be bound by law and not just as a doctrine

209
00:20:05,72 --> 00:20:12,25
but for the effective operation of key institutional arrangements such as judicial review.

210
00:20:12,36 --> 00:20:15,74
Which again didn't exist in the thirteenth century.

211
00:20:15,75 --> 00:20:24,13
Secondly and this is wonderful that says have a general right to liberty. So his wonderful new self well story.

212
00:20:25,64 --> 00:20:32,64
And I did twenty seven there was a wedding and the wedding saying there is a choice of songs produced of Roy it

213
00:20:33,48 --> 00:20:38,28
and the bride and groom had to drag the poor man free and they arrested the two attackers

214
00:20:38,28 --> 00:20:45,4
and brought me for a magistrate who after pronouncing on the aesthetic and moral values of the lyrics.

215
00:20:45,91 --> 00:20:50,87
Went on to say that made in the car to give every Englishman the right to sing.

216
00:20:50,91 --> 00:20:55,55
Now there's nothing there's nothing in there in the Kadare about singing.

217
00:20:56,59 --> 00:21:04,08
Although as I mentioned earlier there's a widespread belief that made the Carter was signed and one schoolboy hell

218
00:21:04,08 --> 00:21:11,7
or not you know five in Australia one bright LED right. The king had to sing Magna Carta. So it's kind of a double era.

219
00:21:14,25 --> 00:21:18,49
Now obviously when we're talking about the right to sing will come a long way from Runnymede.

220
00:21:19,11 --> 00:21:25,96
We're no longer talking about particular medieval grievances but a general right to liberty.

221
00:21:25,97 --> 00:21:31,84
And also the right to self-government because Magna Carta was frequently invoked in eight hundred forty S.

222
00:21:32,84 --> 00:21:35,37
Including the legislative council of New South Wales.

223
00:21:35,74 --> 00:21:42,18
Who produced a demand for self-government in which they argued amongst other things that.

224
00:21:42,54 --> 00:21:47,77
People in New South Wales had been did not write the rights given and make an account of one of these rights

225
00:21:47,77 --> 00:21:57,21
and invention clearly was the idea that Magna Carta gets a right to representative government which is nonsense.

226
00:21:57,4 --> 00:22:04,26
But nonsense has value and he. Stry. Mess aren't just there to be refuted we can do that easily.

227
00:22:04,53 --> 00:22:10,45
But they also are often the basis from which arguments are constructed even thief think they're wrong headed.

228
00:22:10,51 --> 00:22:14,03
But then those are subsequent arguments take off and take hold

229
00:22:15,14 --> 00:22:18,08
and there's a century in why view of what's happened here.

230
00:22:19,6 --> 00:22:25,37
Has also been used in political argument not just legal arguments for instance there was a large debate in late

231
00:22:25,37 --> 00:22:30,61
twenty's and thirty's in New South Wales. Asked for civilian juries.

232
00:22:32,16 --> 00:22:35,89
And it was argued that this was something that been guaranteed by making a counter

233
00:22:35,89 --> 00:22:44,55
and this was the obvious effect that this was used to invoke this way tell you tells you what a pair of iconic river

234
00:22:44,55 --> 00:22:49,6
sainted and was part of course of the intellectual inheritance of the people who came here.

235
00:22:49,61 --> 00:22:53,21
It's also been used to criticize government measures designed his earliest.

236
00:22:53,84 --> 00:22:58,17
Later this year in the Senate centerline home when discussing

237
00:22:58,17 --> 00:23:09,00
and terrorism was thought that there was laws being proposed or an affront to the counter. So this argument has some.

238
00:23:10,47 --> 00:23:13,13
Ability to survive in a straight. So it still matters.

239
00:23:14,2 --> 00:23:19,19
It shows the adaptability of the legal order and that's one of their enormous strengths.

240
00:23:19,21 --> 00:23:24,83
And it's one of the features of common law systems of course we actually live in the age of statutes.

241
00:23:25,02 --> 00:23:32,79
But they're also adaptable and she no. But many acts of parliament are actually revisions amendments changes.

242
00:23:33,04 --> 00:23:34,94
We don't live in a static system.

243
00:23:35,52 --> 00:23:41,28
It's part of what the later tradition of liberty under the law should we all enjoy in Australia.

244
00:23:41,79 --> 00:23:45,21
I think it's an essential part of civic knowledge and it is a matter for a great.

245
00:23:45,61 --> 00:23:52,09
And obviously Chawner of us who are in the history professional know more about this than I do that the teaching of

246
00:23:52,09 --> 00:23:59,68
constitutional history which used to be virtually all of history. Once it's now been set aside and taken over by.

247
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,44
Other areas of history are not complaining about that in the sense that these other areas famous history in history

248
00:24:06,44 --> 00:24:13,15
social history should be taught. They're part of the story. But there is a loss as well as again.

249
00:24:13,52 --> 00:24:22,1
And we have lost something. I think. And lastly the rule of law. Well we know the elements of the rule of law.

250
00:24:22,17 --> 00:24:26,91
Some of these have been mentioned it's a complex thing of course it's not just institutions and doctrines.

251
00:24:27,24 --> 00:24:35,61
It's also other things such as the sociology of a society. I'm always moved when I go to vote. Why.

252
00:24:36,29 --> 00:24:40,74
Even though the person I'm voting for won't win. Or my not all the party may not.

253
00:24:40,78 --> 00:24:49,09
I am moved because it's incredibly civilised peaceful way of deciding a key question who should govern.

254
00:24:49,68 --> 00:24:51,01
And we know the alternatives.

255
00:24:51,18 --> 00:24:58,35
We don't have the Army called up to protect us from goons we don't have ballot stuffing we don't have rigging we have

256
00:24:58,35 --> 00:25:04,91
the occasional screw up that have friends as they did in Western Australia but that's a really rare thing

257
00:25:04,91 --> 00:25:11,28
and it's worth remembering a stranger is a world leader in election administration.

258
00:25:11,3 --> 00:25:15,23
And we've been doing it very well for a very long time

259
00:25:15,23 --> 00:25:23,25
and it's not an accident that this train a little commission for instance has taken itself abroad frequently to advise

260
00:25:23,25 --> 00:25:28,17
other places on how to run things in fifty manner. So we this.

261
00:25:28,38 --> 00:25:32,09
All of this of course means that we live in a free society.

262
00:25:32,6 --> 00:25:39,32
If you look at all the net international indicators such as Freedom House which I should tell it was set up by Eleanor

263
00:25:39,32 --> 00:25:40,69
Roosevelt nine hundred forty three.

264
00:25:42,22 --> 00:25:49,29
It's a website and you can they write countries by their level of freedom democracy. And astride of course.

265
00:25:49,72 --> 00:25:54,14
Naturally is regarded as a free country. So I think the enormous achievement.

266
00:25:54,77 --> 00:26:02,77
To finish of Major Carter was it's adaptability. And the fact that subsequent generations.

267
00:26:02,79 --> 00:26:05,24
Enclosing aero Narromine way.

268
00:26:05,92 --> 00:26:12,63
Have actually reinforced it developed it expanded changed it to produce the system we have today

269
00:26:13,46 --> 00:26:20,11
and that I think is the true achievement of Magna Carta not what the king did or thought he did in twelve fifteen.

270
00:26:20,2 --> 00:26:30,58
But what it's actually now to come. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH for that.

271
00:26:30,66 --> 00:26:31,1
David

272
00:26:31,1 --> 00:26:37,5
and I personally am pleased that you mentioned the importance of constitutional history it is a very important part of

273
00:26:37,5 --> 00:27:03,64
history said far as I'm concerned that we do have time for questions.

274
00:27:03,66 --> 00:27:08,86
To cut the cost problem of colonialism and British colonial colonialism in particular.

275
00:27:08,88 --> 00:27:14,42
Is the contradiction between the rhetorical at home and bear the wonderful freedoms of the English.

276
00:27:15,61 --> 00:27:19,76
I mean when when Blackstone writes his commentaries he talks about the most perfect constitution

277
00:27:20,66 --> 00:27:25,71
and the fact that they took some of those institutions but not all of them when they settled abroad.

278
00:27:26,14 --> 00:27:26,58
And

279
00:27:26,58 --> 00:27:32,7
when I saw it abroad of course I didn't bring the entire system with them because in a colonial system before representative

280
00:27:32,7 --> 00:27:35,13
government. He had Crown Colony government.

281
00:27:35,55 --> 00:27:41,96
You didn't have representative power mints the result of a no legislature was wholly appointed these sorts of things.

282
00:27:42,06 --> 00:27:46,85
So this is actually meant that the settlers often brought the English ideas with them

283
00:27:46,85 --> 00:27:52,59
but they didn't always find them fully developed here because the institutional arrangements would rather different.

284
00:27:52,62 --> 00:27:55,09
And this is what was used to make the Carter.

285
00:27:55,41 --> 00:28:01,2
And I didn't actually mention the sun where you've asked a question why three in my. Subtitle.

286
00:28:02,43 --> 00:28:03,5
Because I think No three.

287
00:28:03,53 --> 00:28:08,75
Jeremy Bentham who never came to Australia wrote a piece on the system of justice in New South Wales.

288
00:28:09,18 --> 00:28:14,48
And which one of his principal complaints was that the people of New South Wales have been denied Magna Carta in this

289
00:28:14,48 --> 00:28:20,84
expanded sense and which I've been using. So this is this is one why.

290
00:28:21,07 --> 00:28:26,69
In a sense the English undermined their own colonial system because they brought some of these values with them which

291
00:28:26,69 --> 00:28:34,65
were then used by these people move heard from John to have was used in various instance in Australia to attack the

292
00:28:34,66 --> 00:28:40,94
colonial system for not being fully British where given the full range of British liberties.

293
00:28:50,26 --> 00:29:27,32
YES RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT.

294
00:29:37,82 --> 00:29:45,29
Yes yes there was and of course the American lesson was a great lesson and from which we benefited.

295
00:29:45,31 --> 00:29:51,69
Because by that although there was of course a near disaster in two incidents

296
00:29:51,69 --> 00:29:54,89
and light eight hundred thirty six Canada. As well.

297
00:29:55,79 --> 00:29:59,81
And so by the eight hundred forty eight hundred forty specifically Canada.

298
00:30:01,09 --> 00:30:05,38
Representative government and responsible government that nearly promised two years later

299
00:30:06,46 --> 00:30:08,51
when people asked for the same arrangement.

300
00:30:08,91 --> 00:30:15,47
So once the genie is out of the bottle once it started to grant more autonomy and more self-government.

301
00:30:15,74 --> 00:30:19,71
But obviously all the different parts of the Empire want it

302
00:30:20,53 --> 00:30:26,26
and obviously the ones who got it quickly were the ones who see that most British.

303
00:30:26,28 --> 00:30:31,51
But there's also in other contradictions in the system as it was an English statute not Scottish.

304
00:30:31,53 --> 00:30:37,78
So in New Zealand which is where our version from there's a contradiction between the Scots wanted which is a

305
00:30:37,78 --> 00:30:41,64
Presbyterian rule in parts of the country with the Church of Scotland

306
00:30:42,86 --> 00:30:47,64
and the Britishness So after a while Englishness becomes Britishness.

307
00:30:47,66 --> 00:30:52,1
And this and this of course is an aside insult to the Scots who think well

308
00:30:52,1 --> 00:30:56,14
when it was maybe we should think about the original division.

309
00:30:56,16 --> 00:31:01,85
But yes it is a contradiction between the a veiled objectors at home.

310
00:31:01,87 --> 00:31:07,67
But it would also the other thing I want to stress is that there's a tendency to pose we've got all in my new situation

311
00:31:07,67 --> 00:31:14,22
mainland or Britain. Actually we fade back into the system and I've written about rebelling. So.

312
00:31:14,81 --> 00:31:16,28
The British didn't have a secret ballot.

313
00:31:16,56 --> 00:31:18,85
We got we in for me the first

314
00:31:18,85 --> 00:31:26,1
and they got the idea from us because they had an inquiry in London they brought over a Victorian service try

315
00:31:26,1 --> 00:31:33,15
and witnesses. And when they brought in their own ballot law. It was modeled on the laws in Australia.

316
00:31:33,17 --> 00:31:39,25
And there's a lot of other innovations that were made in Australia we had a step Bush church they did the first quickly

317
00:31:39,25 --> 00:31:45,43
one last point religious toleration the University of Sydney engine eight hundred fifty says that we no religious test

318
00:31:45,43 --> 00:31:46,98
for entry to the university.

319
00:31:48,31 --> 00:31:55,46
And all the other university statutes since in the Strait of a doctor that that's important because the god awful kind

320
00:31:55,46 --> 00:31:59,77
which up to eight hundred seventy two you had to subscribe to the Articles of Faith.

321
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:03,44
The Church of England they had a religious test. We never did.

322
00:32:16,49 --> 00:32:25,08
Well I mentioned I had a look at some of the history textbooks which have very brief passages is taught. Badly.

323
00:32:25,89 --> 00:32:30,53
Is part of what I call the source and castles approach to medieval history lesson the time them.

324
00:32:30,86 --> 00:32:38,61
How with some costumes and other things. Now it's fairly pointed out that this is often taught at the age of thirteen.

325
00:32:39,27 --> 00:32:46,35
And the abstract ideas might be difficult for students of that age to grasp how the earlier generations weren't.

326
00:32:47,05 --> 00:32:52,57
So limited and seem to be able to get a hold of it unless you're writing about singing rather than signing

327
00:32:52,57 --> 00:32:54,36
and why for those things were wrong. Anyway.

328
00:32:55,12 --> 00:33:03,58
And of course some of the other hell is where Larry is that we were not made the Carter said the King couldn't put

329
00:33:03,58 --> 00:33:07,25
anyone in a lady's house without her permission.

330
00:33:07,27 --> 00:33:14,08
At the album phrase just seized a property means be deprived of property. So one student right.

331
00:33:14,33 --> 00:33:17,47
A person can be diseased without their own consent.

332
00:33:20,61 --> 00:33:28,55
You can find all this stuff by putting the phrase Go boy hello so I have all this in that wonderful national newspaper

333
00:33:28,56 --> 00:33:33,07
database. It's great. One more it's got nothing to make because you got to hear it.

334
00:33:33,95 --> 00:33:38,2
What's a word for a man who has only ONE WIFE Well we know the answers but to me. Monogamy.

335
00:33:39,05 --> 00:33:52,91
The answer given monotony sure the turn is.

336
00:33:53,51 --> 00:33:59,87
The turn does but the constant demand is called as we now use it is only the form of the.

337
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:03,18
Rich where you see a person who's been detained.

338
00:34:03,2 --> 00:34:10,1
Once to get themselves before a court and asked the court to determine like Galatea of a detention that had sub D.C.

339
00:34:10,1 --> 00:34:14,44
End and form of the writ really I need develops from the fifteen eighties on.

340
00:34:14,99 --> 00:34:23,38
And takes off from that sixteen seventeen a famous case involving William Penn of Pennsylvania.

341
00:34:23,6 --> 00:34:32,94
Who had an illegal meeting and was tried and the recorder of London ordered the jury to come in with a certain verdict.

342
00:34:34,37 --> 00:34:38,73
He actually deprived them of food meat drink

343
00:34:38,73 --> 00:34:44,56
and tobacco because it arrived from Virginia earlier in the century until they comply with his wishes

344
00:34:45,51 --> 00:34:53,63
and of the nature of this case is a very famous one namely the judge can't bully jury into a verdict against their

345
00:34:53,64 --> 00:34:53,78
wishes.

346
00:34:56,39 --> 00:35:02,57
And that's another example of the thing we've just pointed out your brilliant book written in nine hundred ten who from

347
00:35:02,57 --> 00:35:06,09
England to empires throughout the history of habeas corpus which is a writ of Liberty.

348
00:35:06,64 --> 00:35:12,74
Which was part of all these legal systems so you got written liberty in places where there are often a lot of illegal

349
00:35:12,74 --> 00:35:24,79
detentions or even lawful detentions which within the subject of criticism. Well.

350
00:35:26,11 --> 00:35:34,62
They like us have attributed a lot of their values to it in this book I help. I contribute last year.

351
00:35:35,51 --> 00:35:42,44
There's essays by American scholars on Magna Carta and the Supreme Court.

352
00:35:42,85 --> 00:35:47,58
And scream referred to one hundred sixty times or something in U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

353
00:35:49,18 --> 00:35:56,46
And incidentally referred to new written dozens of times in the parliamentary debates I think from one thousand nine

354
00:35:56,46 --> 00:35:56,87
hundred on.

355
00:35:57,98 --> 00:35:58,57
So all this stuff

356
00:35:58,57 --> 00:36:05,39
and this is where I would do this work quickly because a one does a digitalization it's given us a lot of material.
