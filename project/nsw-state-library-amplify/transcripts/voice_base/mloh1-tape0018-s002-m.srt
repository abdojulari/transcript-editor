1
00:00:04,20 --> 00:00:10,65
It. Who own these fish took me down.
Deep and obviously snagged up somewhere

2
00:00:11,36 --> 00:00:17,63
. I had to cutting off but i saw what the
hell would be down there from the bottom

3
00:00:17,63 --> 00:00:22,75
of this war and then while i was rigging
up again looking around there were lumps

4
00:00:22,75 --> 00:00:28,69
of granite lying around covered in the
grass and so on. And it suddenly dawned on

5
00:00:28,69 --> 00:00:33,69
me. This was the wharf where the granite
for the sydney harbour bridge pylons were

6
00:00:33,69 --> 00:00:40,12
shipped from and afterwards i told the wife
about this and we looked around and you

7
00:00:40,12 --> 00:00:45,79
could see blocks of granite lying
around on the verges of the quarry and

8
00:00:47,77 --> 00:00:51,61
it certainly brought back the fact that
yes i had been there when this stuff was

9
00:00:51,61 --> 00:00:57,24
being delivered in sydney. What fifty odd
years back. Do you know that quarry was

10
00:00:57,24 --> 00:01:01,92
used after the sydney harbour bridge. I
don't really know it was beautiful granite

11
00:01:02,64 --> 00:01:08,30
very tough stuff. And i'm not
certain i do think it was used on

12
00:01:08,30 --> 00:01:13,12
a few buildings but i couldn't i couldn't
be certain of this. Did you take any of

13
00:01:13,12 --> 00:01:17,97
the photographs for the the cenotaph the
cutting of the stones for the senator. No

14
00:01:17,97 --> 00:01:23,45
no i never did. Is that the same stone.
It's the same stone it was cut at the same

15
00:01:23,45 --> 00:01:27,58
quarry and there was also public works
pictures of the opening of the cenotaph in

16
00:01:27,58 --> 00:01:32,44
martin place so i didn't know whether you
you were there at all. Now i left. Bob

17
00:01:32,44 --> 00:01:37,61
bad and actually before the bridge where
it was foundation and went into newspapers

18
00:01:37,61 --> 00:01:44,53
. But on the day the bridge was opened. I
wasn't up on the roadway i was down in

19
00:01:44,53 --> 00:01:48,77
the launch on the harbour doing the
covering the procession of the overseas and

20
00:01:48,77 --> 00:01:54,12
interstate ships coming through
under the archway. Did you get

21
00:01:54,12 --> 00:01:58,46
a shot of the planes as well.
I think could have done

22
00:01:58,46 --> 00:02:01,79
a forgotten how i think smithy's
playing was flew over in

23
00:02:01,79 --> 00:02:07,68
a few air force and other planes but
actually my memory is much clearer of the

24
00:02:07,68 --> 00:02:11,89
magnificent side of these i think there
are about seven or eight of them. The

25
00:02:11,89 --> 00:02:14,29
liners coming through it was

26
00:02:14,29 --> 00:02:17,66
a magnet and of course they were all decked
out in their flags and everything and

27
00:02:17,66 --> 00:02:19,10
it was a magnificent sight it was

28
00:02:19,10 --> 00:02:26,10
a beautiful day you were there working on
that day were you for the newspapers. Yes

29
00:02:26,10 --> 00:02:32,48
yes that was so but i didn't see any of the
gory degree of an intern end or any of

30
00:02:32,48 --> 00:02:39,01
that. Do you remember the workshops.
When you went photograph them there.

31
00:02:39,10 --> 00:02:44,48
Oh yes indeed. Because the noise in there
was terror efik the riveting going on and

32
00:02:45,21 --> 00:02:48,01
. Although they were huge workshops
they were always know is

33
00:02:48,01 --> 00:02:53,49
a hit and dirty and if the southerly was
blowing clouds of dirt and dust used to

34
00:02:53,49 --> 00:02:59,24
come through the doors and windows. Yes i
member those. When you took photographs.

35
00:02:59,46 --> 00:03:05,47
Did you take any photographs of people
riveting in the workers. Yes we did. And of

36
00:03:05,47 --> 00:03:12,32
course also on the bridge itself
but mostly i work was more general

37
00:03:13,71 --> 00:03:20,65
and jan in detail and we weren't so
concerned with. Actual workers in close

38
00:03:20,65 --> 00:03:25,08
up and that type of thing not working
methods but engineering detail. That's

39
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:32,01
correct yes. He went to work in
melbourne on newspapers will

40
00:03:32,01 --> 00:03:36,02
you ever out of work when you were when you
were in between newspapers or something

41
00:03:36,02 --> 00:03:42,11
. Yes but before going to melbourne. I
went on newspapers in sydney and i joined

42
00:03:42,11 --> 00:03:47,76
the old telegraph victoria when it was in
the trust building in. In king street and

43
00:03:47,77 --> 00:03:51,90
then that folded up and then i went to
the data gardening which was part of the

44
00:03:51,90 --> 00:03:55,96
smiths weekly group. I was there for some
years and then that was sold out to the

45
00:03:55,96 --> 00:04:02,67
sun. And rather the evening
news which is part of the sun

46
00:04:02,67 --> 00:04:09,18
just previously bought. I wasn't there
very long and that folded up. And. These

47
00:04:09,18 --> 00:04:10,16
were the days when

48
00:04:10,97 --> 00:04:14,25
a man would say love his home and
go into state for another pound

49
00:04:14,25 --> 00:04:20,32
a week and they were very grim. But
i battled around with a camera made

50
00:04:20,32 --> 00:04:23,24
a few bob but those were the days if
you could make three or four pound

51
00:04:23,24 --> 00:04:28,31
a week. You could live. Not well but you
could live what you freely do freelance

52
00:04:28,31 --> 00:04:34,58
photography doing that. Yes. Anywhere
you could make it crashed. And then

53
00:04:34,58 --> 00:04:41,54
gradually things improved.
And i went to melbourne on

54
00:04:41,55 --> 00:04:46,73
a freelance basis for two rather odd

55
00:04:47,94 --> 00:04:52,81
newspapers. I went for the women's weekly
and also for the smiths weekly group

56
00:04:52,81 --> 00:04:54,01
being paid

57
00:04:54,01 --> 00:04:58,48
a retainer by both of them smiths weekly
in those days had the referee which was

58
00:04:58,48 --> 00:05:05,31
a sporting paper. So i would cover sporting
events and i and races in. In melbourne

59
00:05:05,31 --> 00:05:09,92
for them. And the women's weekly was
trying to break further into the melbourne

60
00:05:09,92 --> 00:05:16,03
victorian scene and i would cover social
and any local stories for them and it

61
00:05:16,03 --> 00:05:16,82
worked at it quite

62
00:05:16,82 --> 00:05:22,83
a good basis until i was thinking about
getting married. The wife and i were

63
00:05:22,83 --> 00:05:26,31
engaged for five years and you couldn't
dream of getting married. Those days but.

64
00:05:27,84 --> 00:05:33,62
The argus in melbourne was starting an
evening paper. And frank davison who

65
00:05:34,82 --> 00:05:38,88
i'd known on the guardian in he'd married
the first missile stray lia berra meals

66
00:05:40,90 --> 00:05:42,00
happened a bumpy one night in

67
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:45,37
a picture show and bourke street and
he said my god we're looking for

68
00:05:45,37 --> 00:05:48,81
a photographer's bill for god sake
come and join us. It was going to be

69
00:05:48,81 --> 00:05:54,35
a pictorial tabloid. So i
thought well why not give it

70
00:05:54,35 --> 00:05:58,19
a go and i want to get married and although
i was making better money than they

71
00:05:58,19 --> 00:06:02,68
offered me i had a feeling it was too
good to last and i thought a staff job on

72
00:06:02,68 --> 00:06:07,85
a newspaper would prove more sensible
and so this i did and we got married in

73
00:06:07,85 --> 00:06:14,61
melbourne later of course there were
signs that the star was going to go.

74
00:06:14,62 --> 00:06:15,74
And i was offered

75
00:06:15,74 --> 00:06:21,53
a job at the melbourne herald and i spent
some years there with them. Remember

76
00:06:21,54 --> 00:06:24,90
years and smiths weekly.
Oh yes indeed it was

77
00:06:24,90 --> 00:06:29,55
a wonderful period of time there are
some wonderful characters working there

78
00:06:29,55 --> 00:06:33,68
because they are the greatest black and
white staff ever assembled i think anywhere

79
00:06:33,68 --> 00:06:39,67
in the world. At that period. Follows
like frank done. Stand cross

80
00:06:41,46 --> 00:06:48,17
said and miller. Or molly horseman
joe johnson. I can't you know

81
00:06:48,17 --> 00:06:54,64
memory one let me recall them all.
Finally i would george was their course

82
00:06:57,08 --> 00:07:01,47
it's time to recall the
names of them now but

83
00:07:04,22 --> 00:07:10,16
i was trying to think of the tall thin
x digger who did the digger cartoons

84
00:07:13,40 --> 00:07:16,61
. And i can't for the moment. Think of his
name but it will come to me. Could he

85
00:07:16,61 --> 00:07:23,52
remember any chance about the times you
worked at smith wheatley well the us

86
00:07:23,52 --> 00:07:24,39
and i told you there's

87
00:07:24,39 --> 00:07:30,69
a very odd characters there
virgil reilly was there. Verge of

88
00:07:30,69 --> 00:07:36,21
a stamos for his drawings of females. The

89
00:07:37,72 --> 00:07:38,80
joint smith was quite

90
00:07:38,80 --> 00:07:44,48
a character he used to buzz in and out of
the place. Never seemed to take an active

91
00:07:44,48 --> 00:07:49,89
interest much in it. Boss's them
were robert clyde packer and

92
00:07:52,26 --> 00:07:52,58
he was

93
00:07:52,58 --> 00:08:00,07
a wonderful followed to work for the they

94
00:08:00,08 --> 00:08:00,26
had

95
00:08:00,26 --> 00:08:06,25
a great staff there knows days and although
they were battling it was still the depression

96
00:08:06,26 --> 00:08:12,09
years. Do you remember how much
you got paid when you worked as

97
00:08:12,09 --> 00:08:16,64
a photographer assistant at the public
works. From memory i think it was about

98
00:08:16,64 --> 00:08:18,50
thirty five thirty seven shillings

99
00:08:18,50 --> 00:08:24,62
a week. I don't i think
three pound a week then was

100
00:08:24,62 --> 00:08:30,22
a very good wage. You were asking
me about bob bowed and well bob was

101
00:08:30,22 --> 00:08:35,28
a as i mentioned before a very
dedicated photographer. He was

102
00:08:35,28 --> 00:08:39,06
a man who i've seen him come back from

103
00:08:39,83 --> 00:08:45,27
a trip in the country where he be
photographing the mayor and jack dam or

104
00:08:45,27 --> 00:08:52,01
a van dam or cordo dam which were all being
built at that period and he'd been away

105
00:08:52,01 --> 00:08:52,53
for probably

106
00:08:52,53 --> 00:08:57,87
a week or so and he comes to come back and
start processing into negatives and he

107
00:08:57,87 --> 00:09:02,35
was a great believer that negatives had
to be thoroughly washed be due to he had

108
00:09:02,35 --> 00:09:04,32
a great sense of did anything it was

109
00:09:04,32 --> 00:09:10,69
a took was for official records and had
to have permanency and the only day in

110
00:09:10,69 --> 00:09:16,06
those days only way to ensure permanency
was by thoroughly washing your plates and

111
00:09:16,07 --> 00:09:21,05
negatives and he would stay back at night
and sit down and wait for an hour or two

112
00:09:21,05 --> 00:09:25,83
of these plates were thoroughly washed and
he would never dream of short changing

113
00:09:25,83 --> 00:09:30,19
the tide where anything
like that. Is he was

114
00:09:30,19 --> 00:09:32,86
a hard man to work for
in the sense that he had

115
00:09:32,86 --> 00:09:38,87
a high quality standard. But

116
00:09:39,85 --> 00:09:40,08
he was

117
00:09:40,08 --> 00:09:46,61
a man who knew what he wanted and i often
felt that if i had any character building

118
00:09:46,61 --> 00:09:46,78
as

119
00:09:46,78 --> 00:09:52,93
a photographer he did more for me than anyone
else i ever worked with or for afterwards

120
00:09:52,94 --> 00:09:59,23
. Where did he get his training how
he cut is from digger tardy senior.

121
00:09:59,82 --> 00:10:02,83
Who he'd spent his time
with as far as from

122
00:10:02,83 --> 00:10:07,60
a young man. And of course back in those
days they were just emerging from the wet

123
00:10:07,60 --> 00:10:14,31
plate stage. And decca tardy. We
still had there or the old equipment

124
00:10:14,31 --> 00:10:19,11
there that they used to use they are
still go away with a horse and buggy and

125
00:10:19,11 --> 00:10:26,07
a big black tent. Sensitize
the plates in the tent load

126
00:10:26,07 --> 00:10:32,28
them into their big. Slides and expose
them while they were still damp and

127
00:10:32,97 --> 00:10:37,54
process them in the field. And they is
amazing. The results they achieved under

128
00:10:37,54 --> 00:10:44,37
those conditions. And i have great
admiration for for the work they were

129
00:10:44,37 --> 00:10:49,82
doing but from what i was heard of decca
tati i never knew he died before my time

130
00:10:49,82 --> 00:10:51,03
but he was

131
00:10:51,03 --> 00:10:57,34
a man from which bob bowed and
had copied his dedication

132
00:10:59,33 --> 00:11:02,90
. Do you know any other photographers of
the day. Well known photographers now

133
00:11:06,40 --> 00:11:12,88
. Oh there was a hall in hunter street

134
00:11:12,88 --> 00:11:19,67
a forgotten isn't is first name
now sam hood in pitts treat.

135
00:11:19,69 --> 00:11:24,82
One of the one of the best of that area
of course was with the sydney morning

136
00:11:24,82 --> 00:11:30,39
herald and the. The magazine they had
at that time sydney mail sydney mail.

137
00:11:32,66 --> 00:11:38,93
Do you names. Do you remember. Milton. Kent.
Oh yes yes i knew. Milton. Well milton

138
00:11:38,93 --> 00:11:41,24
had his own aeroplane. He was

139
00:11:41,24 --> 00:11:45,81
a pioneer of aerial photography but his
main basis of that time was photographing

140
00:11:45,81 --> 00:11:48,35
motorcars. He had

141
00:11:48,35 --> 00:11:53,57
a dark room and i think one or two visions
in the business with him at five dock is

142
00:11:53,57 --> 00:11:56,16
that's right. Her turn
of him being someone of

143
00:11:56,16 --> 00:12:00,20
a wild man and buzzing everybody all inside.
Yeah by the course those were the days

144
00:12:00,20 --> 00:12:01,51
when aviation was

145
00:12:01,51 --> 00:12:08,07
a devil may care sort of
industry your occupation and

146
00:12:09,10 --> 00:12:15,33
i have great memories of him
be cars. Where we were located

147
00:12:16,29 --> 00:12:18,90
photographic section in the
works building. We had

148
00:12:18,90 --> 00:12:23,67
a dark room on the roof and from our
windows up there you could look down into

149
00:12:23,67 --> 00:12:27,54
macquarie street it looked down on
the conservatorium. And this was

150
00:12:27,54 --> 00:12:32,68
a great spot for militant can't to photograph
his motor cars and we would often see

151
00:12:32,68 --> 00:12:37,10
milton can down there were five or six cars
lined up waiting to be photographed and

152
00:12:37,10 --> 00:12:44,09
of course these were the stand camera plate
glass negatives days and. It wouldn't

153
00:12:44,09 --> 00:12:44,14
be

154
00:12:44,14 --> 00:12:50,33
a quick snapshot job it was you know it took
time. And i'm out i met milton many times

155
00:12:50,33 --> 00:12:53,28
either very likeable
fellow very likeable is

156
00:12:53,28 --> 00:12:56,76
a business is still going and all is old
glass negatives are still available. Is

157
00:12:56,76 --> 00:13:01,14
that so areas son still in the business or
you know his son is out of the business

158
00:13:01,14 --> 00:13:02,69
and he's sold it to

159
00:13:02,69 --> 00:13:07,25
a couple of polish photographers who still
carry on the business and have the all

160
00:13:07,25 --> 00:13:09,97
the glass negatives. When he
was a neighbor's another is

161
00:13:09,97 --> 00:13:15,02
a magnificent photographer that period.
Do you remember another fellow who was

162
00:13:15,02 --> 00:13:20,14
a doctor i believe he's doing real photo
photographs doctoring. Then the much

163
00:13:20,14 --> 00:13:24,79
larger hour can't exactly remember
his no no no. I remember r.p.

164
00:13:24,79 --> 00:13:31,30
More now. No i didn't know him. Maybe
studios know i knew he'd be studios but i

165
00:13:31,30 --> 00:13:36,50
know the name more but i didn't know him
personally. I was trying to think of the

166
00:13:36,50 --> 00:13:43,32
pilot who flew in the early days
with smith the original. Airlines

167
00:13:43,33 --> 00:13:47,72
they were operated. He ran

168
00:13:47,72 --> 00:13:54,71
a photographic business into partnership
with i think it was followed

169
00:13:54,71 --> 00:13:55,39
of

170
00:13:55,39 --> 00:14:02,23
a disaster airways. Gene names. Mr. Astra

171
00:14:02,23 --> 00:14:07,38
reprogram fix are still going instantly
also. Yes well i haven't heard of them for

172
00:14:07,38 --> 00:14:14,30
some years i know they were going some years
back. But the name of trying to think

173
00:14:14,30 --> 00:14:18,71
of talking from the sydney mail
was burt fishwick he was he was

174
00:14:18,71 --> 00:14:23,95
a magnificent photographer. And any of
the oil boys will all remember him with

175
00:14:23,95 --> 00:14:30,77
great admiration and respect. Can i
take you back to the the large in

176
00:14:30,77 --> 00:14:34,73
room on top of the on top of the public
works building exactly how did you do in

177
00:14:34,73 --> 00:14:40,33
those days we had of either complicated
set up. We had an all or lantern type

178
00:14:40,33 --> 00:14:45,26
enlarger. Which was set on four legs

179
00:14:47,78 --> 00:14:48,02
with

180
00:14:48,03 --> 00:14:54,30
a tank of oil which held about twenty gallons
of oil heavy oil. Suspended under it

181
00:14:55,18 --> 00:15:02,01
and. During the exposure. If the
contraption would bump that or

182
00:15:02,82 --> 00:15:09,76
the oil absorbed the vibration and
didn't spoil your exposures and we had

183
00:15:09,76 --> 00:15:16,68
a. A glass. Opal glass piece of

184
00:15:16,68 --> 00:15:22,91
glass set into the wall of the dark room.
Which gave us our daylight for enlarging

185
00:15:22,91 --> 00:15:26,73
and outside we were direct
a sheet of canvas on

186
00:15:26,73 --> 00:15:32,23
a stretcher which was which would help to

187
00:15:34,50 --> 00:15:39,88
watch the word for it. Diffuse while diffuse
the light and also throw it back to

188
00:15:39,88 --> 00:15:46,75
the window and the actual exposure
was made from your daylight and

189
00:15:47,82 --> 00:15:51,100
if it was cloudy conditions. You'd have
to duck out and sign outside and have

190
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,72
a quick look and see if they was a
cloud coming up because it would make

191
00:15:54,72 --> 00:16:00,17
a vast difference to bougie but by this
complicated method it was amazing. The

192
00:16:00,17 --> 00:16:04,61
quality of the enlargements that were
made and that time there was just no

193
00:16:04,61 --> 00:16:08,95
artificial light used in your enlargements
at all. Now no artificial lights used

194
00:16:08,95 --> 00:16:15,89
because in those days you didn't have
the globes that gave you the. The type

195
00:16:15,89 --> 00:16:21,84
of light you required the electric lamps
you know. And although they came in

196
00:16:21,84 --> 00:16:23,83
a few years afterwards and they used

197
00:16:23,83 --> 00:16:29,86
a condenser which would break down any
distortion from the filaments of the lamps

198
00:16:30,59 --> 00:16:33,08
and sort of even it out in the light at.
