1
00:00:11,32 --> 00:00:14,69
Over do. You know.

2
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:20,37
Although.

3
00:00:22,35 --> 00:00:26,92
You know jay and all of us.

4
00:00:26,93 --> 00:00:31,41
You know journal of my name and.

5
00:00:32,48 --> 00:00:37,36
I think i'm involved with the nimbin
adventure in its early in its nascent stages

6
00:00:37,36 --> 00:00:39,61
in sydney when people were beginning to.

7
00:00:40,34 --> 00:00:45,09
Talk about a new new form of arts festival
for university and other students

8
00:00:46,11 --> 00:00:48,83
and i was involved with a mad
mother people who believed

9
00:00:48,83 --> 00:00:52,88
that we had enthusiasm spirit an
adventure to do things differently

10
00:00:52,88 --> 00:00:57,42
and i guess we really. I certainly
believe that we really could.

11
00:00:57,44 --> 00:00:59,34
Bring about social change.

12
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:05,53
That would make for a better world for
ourselves and for the various offspring

13
00:01:05,53 --> 00:01:08,08
that were beginning to appear
around our feet at the time

14
00:01:09,80 --> 00:01:13,30
and it was a very exciting time
for me and i still hold a lot of

15
00:01:13,30 --> 00:01:16,11
that excitement i still hold a
lot of a lot of that idealism

16
00:01:16,86 --> 00:01:22,10
and i make no apologize. The policies.
I make no apologies for being.

17
00:01:22,11 --> 00:01:24,17
An indian hippy. Ok.

18
00:01:24,23 --> 00:01:29,71
I live by the beach at byron bay now but
i i'm a hippy died and true. You know.

19
00:01:30,03 --> 00:01:33,16
Whatever the expression is and
i've had a lot of enjoyment

20
00:01:33,16 --> 00:01:37,16
and a lot of learning from
those times till now.

21
00:01:38,73 --> 00:01:41,18
People often say have you got any regrets.

22
00:01:41,20 --> 00:01:46,46
About the time you spent at nimbin
and i think regrets my gosh.

23
00:01:46,85 --> 00:01:50,47
Nancy asking a question
like that. I think it's.

24
00:01:51,54 --> 00:01:55,53
It's been a wonderful social experiment
it is a wonderful social experiment

25
00:01:55,53 --> 00:01:59,77
and i really believe that although
lots of the things that we thought.

26
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,88
May occur and some of the social
change that we thought may occur

27
00:02:02,88 --> 00:02:05,02
and be more far reaching
throughout australia

28
00:02:05,02 --> 00:02:08,92
and indeed the world even though those things
some of those things haven't occurred.

29
00:02:09,34 --> 00:02:12,00
I still believe that the
very influential centre

30
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:17,50
and really does does formulate a lot of
creative change on this north coast area

31
00:02:17,50 --> 00:02:24,18
and throughout the east
coast of new south wales.

32
00:02:26,17 --> 00:02:28,62
Memories of the festival
an image of the festival.

33
00:02:29,20 --> 00:02:35,31
A beautiful place magnificent
weather fantastic hills.

34
00:02:36,38 --> 00:02:42,89
Hundreds of little fire. That night campsites
night spread throughout the valley.

35
00:02:42,91 --> 00:02:51,08
Just directly behind them then it really
felt quite tribal it was very gentle.

36
00:02:51,10 --> 00:02:54,29
Wonderful entertainers and creative people

37
00:02:55,02 --> 00:02:56,58
that were brought in
specifically for the festival

38
00:02:57,40 --> 00:02:58,76
and a lot of wonderful discussions

39
00:02:58,76 --> 00:03:02,93
and ideas it was a very alive time i
mean you could spend from 25 hours a day

40
00:03:02,93 --> 00:03:09,64
discussing interesting. Things
with a number of different people.

41
00:03:09,66 --> 00:03:13,18
It was very very much of
the image of long here

42
00:03:13,18 --> 00:03:19,20
and far out flower folk with women in
long dresses and babies at their breasts

43
00:03:19,20 --> 00:03:25,61
and things like that and of course that
something that i like to talk about later.

44
00:03:27,06 --> 00:03:31,27
It was amazing for me it was amazing to
be able to to live out in a beautiful

45
00:03:31,27 --> 00:03:34,51
countryside area with so
many wonderful people.

46
00:03:34,82 --> 00:03:36,47
I mean i think there's
something like 8000 people.

47
00:03:36,70 --> 00:03:38,15
The estimates are guesstimates

48
00:03:38,15 --> 00:03:42,25
that the numbers who came through the
festival certainly a lot for a little town

49
00:03:42,25 --> 00:03:45,84
like nimbin i mean the streets were just
chock a block with people you can barely

50
00:03:45,84 --> 00:03:48,16
get a vehicle down the street.

51
00:03:49,85 --> 00:03:54,50
I remember sleep pretty tightrope
walking between the tomato sauce

52
00:03:55,32 --> 00:03:59,89
and the nimbin pub juggling burning stick.

53
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,12
It's on a tight rope that the
fellow from a part of the problem

54
00:04:04,12 --> 00:04:09,80
but paul viral knew no this sort of thing
dollar brand playing amazing far out

55
00:04:09,80 --> 00:04:16,65
piano in the jazz piano in
the nimbin hole and i mean.

56
00:04:17,07 --> 00:04:21,20
Philippa t again writing his unicycle
through the streets of nimbin

57
00:04:21,20 --> 00:04:26,15
and down towards the showground the hari
krishnas wandering around singing in the

58
00:04:26,15 --> 00:04:28,45
sleep for hours providing amazing meals

59
00:04:28,45 --> 00:04:32,90
and then the hari krishnas being followed
by a group of sort of far out hippies

60
00:04:32,90 --> 00:04:36,69
with gumboots going harry gumboot harry
gumboot harry gumboot harry gumbleton

61
00:04:37,60 --> 00:04:40,92
everybody tolerating everybody i mean it
really pushed a lot of people's buttons in

62
00:04:40,92 --> 00:04:45,96
terms of toleration i remember the police
attempting to arrest people for drugs

63
00:04:47,37 --> 00:04:51,23
which always seemed to me from my
very close proximity to the event

64
00:04:51,23 --> 00:04:56,19
that it was a plant and basically the
people said no we will control it.

65
00:04:56,23 --> 00:05:01,27
The people are not dealing drugs
it is not a drug scene and.

66
00:05:02,13 --> 00:05:06,11
Just basically issuing the police out
releasing the people who were arrested

67
00:05:06,11 --> 00:05:10,84
or who had been apprehended they weren't
arrested and was a very powerful time

68
00:05:10,84 --> 00:05:11,15
that way.

69
00:05:12,17 --> 00:05:15,32
There was the learning unit where
people would put up interesting areas

70
00:05:15,32 --> 00:05:17,59
that on a blackboard that they
were interested in discussing

71
00:05:17,59 --> 00:05:21,85
or giving a seminar on or whatever
and there was a very alive time.

72
00:05:22,03 --> 00:05:24,12
Lots of wonderful music
here there and everywhere

73
00:05:24,12 --> 00:05:29,33
and we want to say we our extended
family group from the city.

74
00:05:29,38 --> 00:05:34,71
We had set up a large area where
we had a commune or far community.

75
00:05:34,89 --> 00:05:36,94
Kitchen and all our tents all around.

76
00:05:37,22 --> 00:05:40,91
So any time you wanted a little
bit of home hearth warmth

77
00:05:40,91 --> 00:05:42,85
and comfort you could just want there

78
00:05:42,85 --> 00:05:48,33
and be anything from you know half a dozen
people to maybe 30 at meal time around.

79
00:05:48,80 --> 00:05:53,18
And basically for many of us who had been
raised in nuclear families post world war

80
00:05:53,18 --> 00:05:56,02
two nuclear families and
some of us of course

81
00:05:56,02 --> 00:05:59,95
that had the experience of living
community but to live with this big it.

82
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,97
Standard family or tribal
family it was just wonderful.

83
00:06:03,20 --> 00:06:06,58
And it really did did show that
people can live together harmoniously

84
00:06:06,58 --> 00:06:10,19
and happily and creatively
and excited about italy.

85
00:06:10,23 --> 00:06:14,26
It was sure only for a short period of
time and everybody's on good behavior

86
00:06:14,26 --> 00:06:16,99
or on their best behavior
at times like that

87
00:06:16,99 --> 00:06:21,47
but it was a really hopeful
time dutiful. Other memories a.

88
00:06:21,49 --> 00:06:25,42
Teepees covered in thatch
cut from the fields.

89
00:06:26,30 --> 00:06:30,09
Dozens of people wandering around with
video cameras and tape recorders.

90
00:06:30,28 --> 00:06:33,56
I often wonder what
happened to those archives.

91
00:06:34,45 --> 00:06:39,13
Local shopkeepers and local townsfolk
who had been very carefully

92
00:06:39,13 --> 00:06:45,53
and continually consulted about this process
had no idea what they were in for we

93
00:06:45,53 --> 00:06:47,76
had no idea what we were in for
when we started setting it up.

94
00:06:50,33 --> 00:06:51,68
But they were sort of slightly shocked

95
00:06:51,68 --> 00:06:58,49
and bemused most of the time incredibly
tolerant daisy's cafe daisy stewart who is

96
00:06:58,49 --> 00:07:02,17
somebody i would hope
you have talked with.

97
00:07:02,18 --> 00:07:05,06
Was one of those examples of
sheer tolerance the smiths.

98
00:07:05,28 --> 00:07:06,26
Molly smith molly

99
00:07:06,26 --> 00:07:09,63
and tom smith used to live on the main
street in town millions methadose million

100
00:07:09,63 --> 00:07:13,67
time ago said now that's very
charters mother and father

101
00:07:14,58 --> 00:07:15,69
and the chatters are still in town.

102
00:07:16,28 --> 00:07:19,53
With their daughter narrating
their hardware store.

103
00:07:19,55 --> 00:07:22,05
Mollie smith and tom smith sitting
right in the middle of it.

104
00:07:22,10 --> 00:07:27,00
Their little bent wooden chairs right in
the the entrance to their once shop now

105
00:07:27,00 --> 00:07:31,81
then house which is now than in the
gallery and second hand goods gallery.

106
00:07:31,94 --> 00:07:35,99
They would sit there and they would
say things like you want to be there.

107
00:07:37,07 --> 00:07:40,73
This is the best colour television
in the whole of the world and

108
00:07:40,73 --> 00:07:43,27
that they sincerely believed it
and they were they were happy.

109
00:07:43,43 --> 00:07:46,85
I mean a lot of the old
timers as they were called.

110
00:07:47,90 --> 00:07:50,41
Although then used shocked
people you know scared

111
00:07:50,41 --> 00:07:54,63
or whatever were really delighted
to see their dying town. Really.

112
00:07:56,02 --> 00:07:59,73
Re generating you know so many of
those older people they had seen.

113
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,13
Many of their children or their and

114
00:08:02,13 --> 00:08:05,25
that grandchildren move away from the area
because there's nothing holding them in

115
00:08:05,25 --> 00:08:05,45
them

116
00:08:05,45 --> 00:08:10,46
but it was a dying rundown falling to
pieces old wooden buildings town very quiet

117
00:08:10,46 --> 00:08:13,58
for the passer by. But any
teenage kids living there.

118
00:08:13,58 --> 00:08:14,69
It was like death

119
00:08:15,43 --> 00:08:19,09
and so to see this new energy coming a lot
they had no idea what it was about a way

120
00:08:19,09 --> 00:08:22,24
it was heading. They were really quite
supportive because they could remember.

121
00:08:22,54 --> 00:08:26,05
For example where we lived in paradise
valley where we have entry we bought land

122
00:08:26,05 --> 00:08:28,50
just before the festival.

123
00:08:28,51 --> 00:08:32,69
At the end of crofton road under blue knob
where we live we were the last people

124
00:08:32,69 --> 00:08:37,33
along the road. Now that
there were where we believe.

125
00:08:37,34 --> 00:08:42,72
Many years ago 20 italian families
beyond us into the valley living so

126
00:08:42,73 --> 00:08:46,99
that no had seen very populated times and
then people had wandered away again.

127
00:08:47,17 --> 00:08:54,26
It was a big part of the dairy industry
up in part of the logging industry.

128
00:08:55,19 --> 00:08:56,61
We were the new migrant push for sure.

129
00:08:56,86 --> 00:09:02,15
And we was probably in many ways as many
of us was disrespectful as any migrant

130
00:09:02,15 --> 00:09:07,58
push or invasion. And now the
word was we were very respectful.

131
00:09:08,54 --> 00:09:12,69
I was really happy to be associated
with the people of paradise valley and

132
00:09:13,56 --> 00:09:15,43
that was my extended
family for many many years

133
00:09:15,43 --> 00:09:20,76
and many of those people still
are maxed in the family and.

134
00:09:20,78 --> 00:09:24,19
Because we always we made a policy of
really informing people about what we were

135
00:09:24,19 --> 00:09:25,76
about we felt that information.

136
00:09:26,07 --> 00:09:31,95
What was part of our political ideology
that if you have full information then you.

137
00:09:33,35 --> 00:09:36,56
You don't get into trouble because everybody
has the full information people are

138
00:09:36,56 --> 00:09:41,49
free to make decisions with full information
so we decided almost as a policy it

139
00:09:41,49 --> 00:09:43,13
wasn't a written policy
or anything like that

140
00:09:43,13 --> 00:09:46,29
that we would tell all our neighbors
and locals about who we were

141
00:09:46,29 --> 00:09:50,68
and what we were about and we found that
by opening ourselves up to people like

142
00:09:50,68 --> 00:09:53,94
that they were very welcoming
totally supportive of us.

143
00:09:53,94 --> 00:09:55,97
I mean the generosity that we received

144
00:09:55,97 --> 00:09:59,67
when we first moved to the area was was
almost embarrassing for many years.

145
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:02,91
I mean we go and visit our next door
neighbors sloane dudley harris.

146
00:10:03,15 --> 00:10:07,49
You know totally raw you know hippies
from the city come to sort of you know

147
00:10:08,32 --> 00:10:11,00
survive on the land. The typical image

148
00:10:12,45 --> 00:10:15,36
and they would give us we would
walk away with ducks and chalks

149
00:10:15,36 --> 00:10:18,77
and fresh vegetables from the
gardens and preserves and jams

150
00:10:18,77 --> 00:10:20,91
and i mean it was it was
really embarrassing

151
00:10:20,91 --> 00:10:24,74
and what could you give these people back
i mean you know i raised my first crop of

152
00:10:24,74 --> 00:10:27,43
beans. You know these very excitedly

153
00:10:27,43 --> 00:10:32,85
and sort of was it really appropriate to
take them down to somebody who's not just

154
00:10:32,85 --> 00:10:35,48
beans but 17 and things like that.

155
00:10:37,26 --> 00:10:40,70
You know another others all sorts of funny
stories come to my mind you know real

156
00:10:40,70 --> 00:10:46,17
new style to stuff like. Tell about
the chalk tell it about the chook.

157
00:10:47,85 --> 00:10:53,52
Ok so we decided to raise chalk because
we wanted to have fresh eggs free range

158
00:10:53,52 --> 00:10:55,09
fresh eggs took us to eat.

159
00:10:55,19 --> 00:10:59,32
So we acquired from charlie soured who
was the local tip man who's quite a

160
00:10:59,32 --> 00:11:02,49
character who i hope you've
encountered who was the chook.

161
00:11:03,18 --> 00:11:06,47
To king basically of the whole region.

162
00:11:06,49 --> 00:11:10,06
We acquired 5 2 wks and at

163
00:11:10,06 --> 00:11:14,14
that stage we had no road to drive up to
our humble dwellings so we had to walk up

164
00:11:14,14 --> 00:11:16,61
a very steep hill across the
creek and up a very steep hill

165
00:11:17,50 --> 00:11:19,03
and in the heat of summer.

166
00:11:19,05 --> 00:11:24,31
John and i carried in his bags these took
a very quick to put chocks impatient

167
00:11:24,31 --> 00:11:27,02
but what about them you know
we carried them up the hill

168
00:11:27,02 --> 00:11:28,78
and finally got them up there and

169
00:11:28,78 --> 00:11:35,26
when we liberated them into their newly
created chook pen with beautiful he touches

170
00:11:35,26 --> 00:11:37,09
like you know gold doors
and things like that

171
00:11:37,79 --> 00:11:39,98
and rainbow rambo signs over the door.

172
00:11:39,98 --> 00:11:45,03
You know i mean we really wanted to welcome
our children. One of them had died.

173
00:11:46,13 --> 00:11:47,60
God what do you do with the chalk.

174
00:11:47,67 --> 00:11:52,90
Well this chick was perfectly alright
before we had begun our scent.

175
00:11:53,04 --> 00:11:55,89
So i trudged over to our
neighbours which you know probably

176
00:11:55,89 --> 00:11:57,99
that quarter of an hour to walk
over there or something like that

177
00:11:57,99 --> 00:12:00,48
and it flood what i do with a
truck that's. Do you think.

178
00:12:00,50 --> 00:12:03,81
Well it's alright you pluck it. Yes
i know but how do you pluck it.

179
00:12:05,79 --> 00:12:07,75
So she sort of told me how you plucked it

180
00:12:07,75 --> 00:12:14,11
and so i then tried to back up the hill and
five. Chalk with pliers we're pulling.

181
00:12:15,63 --> 00:12:21,75
Herself. Look at i'm thinking
this is a self-sufficient.

182
00:12:21,76 --> 00:12:25,46
She had a mission to tell me that
you plunge the chalk in hot water.

183
00:12:25,75 --> 00:12:27,31
She had assumed that i thought.

184
00:12:27,57 --> 00:12:31,93
This basic thing so eventually i
think i'd gone back to ask her again

185
00:12:31,93 --> 00:12:32,71
and so i'd learnt

186
00:12:32,71 --> 00:12:35,85
that yes you plunge the talk about water
because i'd put it in boiling hot water

187
00:12:35,85 --> 00:12:40,06
for too long so by the time the feathers
were plucked out this chook was peeling

188
00:12:40,06 --> 00:12:42,97
and battered.

189
00:12:43,93 --> 00:12:46,69
And then you know had to gut it which was
something i hadn't encountered before.

190
00:12:47,62 --> 00:12:53,27
I mean. I can remind john and i laughing
hilariously at the time at ourselves.

191
00:12:53,29 --> 00:12:57,63
But also there was a slight
element of despair you might.

192
00:12:57,65 --> 00:13:03,25
So we were very raw but very very
enthusiastic and we were quite determined

193
00:13:03,25 --> 00:13:09,89
that we were going to get there. When
it's cut that well i think about it.

194
00:13:12,51 --> 00:13:18,91
With a hard time living in than being hip
in the community members of course who

195
00:13:18,91 --> 00:13:19,37
are hard times.

196
00:13:22,24 --> 00:13:27,46
It's funny how things you know like you
tend to repress the unpleasant memories.

197
00:13:27,52 --> 00:13:28,20
I don't think i've done

198
00:13:28,20 --> 00:13:31,06
that i think i just put them into
a different kind of perspective.

199
00:13:32,24 --> 00:13:38,09
We lived community and the household
that harry in this and john

200
00:13:38,09 --> 00:13:40,75
and i built became the
community households many more

201
00:13:40,75 --> 00:13:44,26
and as people built their houses
many of them used our kitchen

202
00:13:44,26 --> 00:13:45,92
and bathroom as their kitchen

203
00:13:45,92 --> 00:13:48,40
and bathroom while they were
establishing their own and it was really

204
00:13:48,40 --> 00:13:52,50
that the community's main
house for many years.

205
00:13:52,52 --> 00:13:54,12
Everybody would pass in and out of it

206
00:13:54,12 --> 00:13:59,67
and it was nothing for
us to have 20 people.

207
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,59
Do you know it was a frequent event
and that was a very happy event

208
00:14:03,59 --> 00:14:08,58
but it was also a very energy
consuming event we had lots of kids.

209
00:14:08,77 --> 00:14:10,84
We had a very good ratio of adults to kids

210
00:14:10,84 --> 00:14:15,45
that is we had many more adults to kids
very healthy really relationship i think in

211
00:14:15,45 --> 00:14:19,18
that it meant there were usually.
Every kid always had some adult.

212
00:14:19,42 --> 00:14:23,35
Happy to be available to them you might
be getting on particularly well with your

213
00:14:23,35 --> 00:14:26,35
mum. Well you just could avoid her and go

214
00:14:26,35 --> 00:14:29,07
and spend some time with somebody
else who welcome you with open arms.

215
00:14:29,21 --> 00:14:34,29
So the kids had a good time of it and
i think we all i think i did too

216
00:14:34,29 --> 00:14:38,37
that the hard times were
working out the the stresses

217
00:14:38,37 --> 00:14:43,29
and the difficulties we were very
functional i think in terms of.

218
00:14:44,47 --> 00:14:49,29
Avoiding the sorts of stresses
that a lot of shared household

219
00:14:49,29 --> 00:14:51,85
or community households often encounter.

220
00:14:51,90 --> 00:14:55,03
I mean we just had guidelines
you know wasn't the rule.

221
00:14:55,09 --> 00:14:56,46
It was just how we accepted it.

222
00:14:56,52 --> 00:15:00,30
Each other's lives and how it come
to live together over many years and

223
00:15:00,31 --> 00:15:03,20
that was because we lived together
in a city many of us before that.

224
00:15:03,31 --> 00:15:06,69
You didn't leave you washing up
on the sink things like that.

225
00:15:06,78 --> 00:15:09,30
So you never we just had
that as sort of base.

226
00:15:10,15 --> 00:15:11,93
So we never had that kind of stress

227
00:15:11,93 --> 00:15:16,01
or who used to need to wash up there was a
it was a great spirit of generosity with

228
00:15:16,01 --> 00:15:18,23
the people that i did
with an early years and

229
00:15:18,24 --> 00:15:21,57
that spirit of generosity
was very important.

230
00:15:21,59 --> 00:15:25,33
The spirit of generosity towards each other
as adults spirit of generosity towards

231
00:15:25,33 --> 00:15:31,72
each other's kids spirit of generosity
towards each others friends and relatives.

232
00:15:31,74 --> 00:15:37,72
Some of the hard times i think for me
were not having enough space to take my

233
00:15:38,57 --> 00:15:42,48
space away my privacy and i don't necessarily
think that's anybody else's fault.

234
00:15:42,59 --> 00:15:45,78
Other than my own for not wanting to i don't
want to miss out on any of the action

235
00:15:45,78 --> 00:15:51,85
in a way and none of us did. We had lots
of issues to work out of the ground money.

236
00:15:52,35 --> 00:15:57,80
What's equal were some of us went out to
work in fairly highly paid jobs others

237
00:15:57,80 --> 00:15:59,84
others of us were staying
home and building.

238
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,73
Or being the home people what where is
the equity there we never really fully

239
00:16:03,73 --> 00:16:06,72
address those issues and they
were some fairly hard times

240
00:16:07,42 --> 00:16:10,50
when relationships altered
and many of them broke up.

241
00:16:12,05 --> 00:16:15,15
Which is not an honest unusual
event for any body in those eras

242
00:16:15,15 --> 00:16:18,25
or now even they of course you know if
you were in a personal relationship

243
00:16:18,25 --> 00:16:21,05
that was in crisis because
that affected everybody else

244
00:16:21,05 --> 00:16:24,90
and they were so very difficult
times for us as community members.

245
00:16:25,34 --> 00:16:29,90
It was hard building a you know physically
getting out there and building fences

246
00:16:29,91 --> 00:16:30,83
and bridges

247
00:16:30,83 --> 00:16:38,14
and houses from by a load of people
who basically be in academics.

248
00:16:38,16 --> 00:16:43,09
I think we were academics and continued
although we had our sort of activities

249
00:16:43,10 --> 00:16:46,64
that we did many of us have continued
to be in that sort of line

250
00:16:46,64 --> 00:16:49,75
that were there originally. So
you know they were had time.

251
00:16:50,16 --> 00:16:54,21
There was some very heated.

252
00:16:55,12 --> 00:16:59,17
Times around how do you
discipline children.

253
00:16:59,18 --> 00:17:00,09
And

254
00:17:00,09 --> 00:17:03,94
that was a very interesting thing about it
was hard at times it was a very again the

255
00:17:03,94 --> 00:17:05,28
spirit of generosity was there

256
00:17:05,28 --> 00:17:11,34
and a lot of people found it difficult to
have a non-biological parent for example

257
00:17:11,34 --> 00:17:15,06
interact with their young child
in the decent disciplinary

258
00:17:15,06 --> 00:17:19,83
or limit setting type of way and. I
mean i think i learned very quickly.

259
00:17:20,18 --> 00:17:23,67
I've had the privilege of living with
young children before i had my own

260
00:17:23,67 --> 00:17:27,94
and so i had been in that role of being
prepared to be committed to children in

261
00:17:27,94 --> 00:17:32,47
that way of setting limits because it is a
commitment to be prepared to go through

262
00:17:32,47 --> 00:17:34,24
the thick and the thin not just to think

263
00:17:34,24 --> 00:17:38,77
and not just to be nice friends all the
time so the time my kids came along i was

264
00:17:38,77 --> 00:17:42,97
more experience with that but to
watch somebody else disciplining

265
00:17:42,98 --> 00:17:47,70
or setting limits with your own child
which may be a raging battle between a

266
00:17:48,46 --> 00:17:53,34
stroppy 4 year old and a fairly
adamant adult and trust that process

267
00:17:53,34 --> 00:17:54,02
and to know

268
00:17:54,02 --> 00:17:57,88
that those two people had a commitment
particularly adult to the child commitment

269
00:17:57,88 --> 00:17:59,88
kids never had any
difficulty committing them.

270
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,47
Well to anybody that would love
them but to watch that and know

271
00:18:03,47 --> 00:18:05,27
that the adult was so
committed to the child

272
00:18:05,27 --> 00:18:08,40
that even if they were
in a stressful situation

273
00:18:08,40 --> 00:18:10,96
that they would with their
own space and time.

274
00:18:11,42 --> 00:18:16,03
Come back to being with that child
sitting that child on their knee loving

275
00:18:16,03 --> 00:18:19,27
that child and coming back
to the loving relationship

276
00:18:19,27 --> 00:18:22,88
and letting what had passed
be passed so that was.

277
00:18:23,47 --> 00:18:27,52
Although that could be seen as difficult
i saw some of our best growing times

278
00:18:28,37 --> 00:18:29,07
and in later years.

279
00:18:29,33 --> 00:18:32,83
Some people who came to the community
with older children who hadn't had

280
00:18:32,83 --> 00:18:37,16
that experience of having the kids
communards children from very from birth

281
00:18:37,16 --> 00:18:41,05
or from very early on i think found
that very difficult and i found

282
00:18:41,05 --> 00:18:45,68
that more stressful than anything that
ever occurred for me with my kids

283
00:18:46,94 --> 00:18:51,63
and it's really interesting to see how
social conditioning gets laid down very

284
00:18:51,63 --> 00:18:53,00
easily and very early.

285
00:18:53,84 --> 00:18:55,46
Like i think jonah's a very good example

286
00:18:56,37 --> 00:18:59,27
and sally's a very good example
of kids who were commune kids

287
00:19:00,10 --> 00:19:03,07
and really assumed that any adults

288
00:19:03,07 --> 00:19:07,55
that were around were available to them
they really weren't kids who went through

289
00:19:07,55 --> 00:19:09,84
that and now i want me
to get me at the drink

290
00:19:09,84 --> 00:19:13,18
or sort of phase if there was an adult

291
00:19:13,18 --> 00:19:17,53
or a taller pair of legs basically
around who can provide for them

292
00:19:17,53 --> 00:19:21,28
that particular need they
would ask for it and.

293
00:19:22,04 --> 00:19:25,80
So some of those difficulties of people
working out their relationships to children

294
00:19:25,80 --> 00:19:27,33
and things like that may
have been difficulties

295
00:19:27,33 --> 00:19:31,23
but the the long term effect was a
very positive and a very healthy one.

296
00:19:31,24 --> 00:19:45,26
I believe.

297
00:19:45,28 --> 00:19:52,24
So well for me i was prepared to
put pretty well everything up for

298
00:19:52,24 --> 00:19:55,76
grabs. Theoretically anyway.

299
00:19:55,78 --> 00:19:59,95
I think it's taken me a long time to even
consider some of the areas that i didn't.

300
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,03
It i think you needed analysis
of the time that still do.

301
00:20:04,31 --> 00:20:10,17
Yeah i mean just being i was an
urban dweller all of my life.

302
00:20:11,33 --> 00:20:14,61
And to move to the country was a
very expansive experience for me.

303
00:20:14,64 --> 00:20:16,71
You just the space the freedom that

304
00:20:16,71 --> 00:20:20,59
that gave me i could decide what to build
wherever i liked that was fantastic.

305
00:20:21,21 --> 00:20:25,93
So on those sorts of physical
parameters it was very new

306
00:20:25,94 --> 00:20:29,05
and i could make up anything i wanted
to i wanted to build a large house

307
00:20:29,05 --> 00:20:32,12
that sort of had separate units
to most of connected by walkways

308
00:20:32,12 --> 00:20:34,24
and lots of people could
happily ever after living it.

309
00:20:34,31 --> 00:20:38,72
So i decided to do it you know i mean i
was sort of fairly fearless in that way.

310
00:20:38,76 --> 00:20:41,71
I thought because we'll do it
now when we went to council

311
00:20:41,71 --> 00:20:44,18
and said you know these are our building
plans you know we're doing it the right

312
00:20:44,18 --> 00:20:46,30
way we're doing it by the
letter of the law and all that.

313
00:20:46,35 --> 00:20:48,96
So i think i said oh no you
can't do that and i said well

314
00:20:50,46 --> 00:20:55,19
but we're going to you know i mean i
was i wasn't being brash or nasty.

315
00:20:55,28 --> 00:20:58,00
I was just but you know
that's what i'm going to do.

316
00:20:58,02 --> 00:20:59,20
It's you know like

317
00:20:59,99 --> 00:21:04,35
and i sort of said all community health
inspector wally duckling was a real problem

318
00:21:04,35 --> 00:21:05,88
to him. So i learned very quickly.

319
00:21:06,18 --> 00:21:10,49
This man is very good at creating problems
to have the best thing i can do is offer

320
00:21:10,49 --> 00:21:14,53
him the opportunity to solve a problem for
me. So we presented it in that way and.

321
00:21:15,12 --> 00:21:18,08
After many many weeks of dialogue
and negotiation he told us

322
00:21:18,08 --> 00:21:20,30
that we could actually do
exactly what we had on paper.

323
00:21:20,53 --> 00:21:22,55
If we called it something else

324
00:21:22,55 --> 00:21:27,88
and so we had this thing called special
was special residency occupancy buildings

325
00:21:27,88 --> 00:21:29,73
shrubs as they became known.

326
00:21:29,92 --> 00:21:34,10
Thank you very much mr. kling we
said very politely we went away

327
00:21:34,10 --> 00:21:40,29
and what we wanted to do we thought we
were well i was new to create an extended

328
00:21:40,29 --> 00:21:44,62
family. Most of us had come from what we
considered to be dysfunctional families.

329
00:21:44,72 --> 00:21:48,87
But what i considered to
be dysfunctional families.

330
00:21:48,89 --> 00:21:53,28
And we really felt that we could
probably do it better together.

331
00:21:53,30 --> 00:21:54,24
I didn't seem

332
00:21:54,24 --> 00:21:58,93
that difficult a task to live with
people with generous spirit generosity

333
00:21:58,93 --> 00:22:01,59
and to love each other. To like each
other to love each other's kids

334
00:22:02,41 --> 00:22:07,29
and to give kids the opportunity. Instead
of having to be locked in that mum dad

335
00:22:07,29 --> 00:22:10,27
or mom or just dad or just mama

336
00:22:10,27 --> 00:22:14,09
or whatever you know sort of the nuclear
family even if was a single parent nuclear

337
00:22:14,09 --> 00:22:15,27
family rather than being locked in

338
00:22:15,27 --> 00:22:19,33
that to be giving our kids the
opportunity to have a much broader.

339
00:22:21,72 --> 00:22:24,19
Scope of people to choose
their relationships from

340
00:22:24,19 --> 00:22:28,56
and to form their own form in their own
selves from you know i mean i was really

341
00:22:28,56 --> 00:22:34,76
quite happy to have and still them to
have any adults put an input to the kids

342
00:22:34,76 --> 00:22:35,74
and i figured

343
00:22:35,74 --> 00:22:38,81
that they'd make the intelligent choices
along the way as to which were the best

344
00:22:38,81 --> 00:22:40,67
bits of everybody or everybody's attitude

345
00:22:40,67 --> 00:22:46,67
and as a result they probably come out to
be really wonderful people. It's true.

346
00:22:46,69 --> 00:22:47,89
I don't know what i answered

347
00:22:47,89 --> 00:22:56,15
that question driving.

348
00:22:58,86 --> 00:23:00,11
All can i take you up on that.

349
00:23:00,36 --> 00:23:04,10
The statement was that it put a
lot of strain on relationships.

350
00:23:04,46 --> 00:23:05,74
I don't know that that's true.

351
00:23:06,93 --> 00:23:13,58
I think living successfully
with any partner is quite an

352
00:23:13,58 --> 00:23:17,75
energy an emotion consuming experience.

353
00:23:18,82 --> 00:23:25,39
And i learned a lot from those times
because i not only was in a relationship.

354
00:23:25,40 --> 00:23:29,64
But i had the opportunity to view it
very close quarters other relationships.

355
00:23:29,79 --> 00:23:30,86
It's true

356
00:23:30,86 --> 00:23:34,61
that many of those relationships most
of those relationships no longer exist.

357
00:23:35,82 --> 00:23:36,16
But is

358
00:23:36,16 --> 00:23:40,27
that statistically different from anywhere
else at you know i don't think it is not

359
00:23:40,27 --> 00:23:45,87
my observation i can remember reading
statistics in the 70s where.

360
00:23:45,89 --> 00:23:52,69
From the north coast area which i think
said that 60 per cent of school students.

361
00:23:52,91 --> 00:23:57,21
I think it was early high school students
high school students 60 percent of the

362
00:23:57,21 --> 00:23:58,88
students came from separated families.

363
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:03,29
Now that was at a time that was in the
whole area this wasn't just me but

364
00:24:03,29 --> 00:24:06,99
that was at the time where
it was still considered.

365
00:24:07,01 --> 00:24:10,57
You've had a marital breakdown or
your relationships in that having.

366
00:24:11,04 --> 00:24:15,63
Do you from you from a separated family
are you or you pulled the you know

367
00:24:15,63 --> 00:24:19,32
that kind of attitude was still prevalent
even though the statistics were to the

368
00:24:19,32 --> 00:24:22,23
contrary. And i can remember i think
harry coming home with that statistic

369
00:24:22,23 --> 00:24:24,88
and that's discussing it and
having a good ole chuckle knowing

370
00:24:24,88 --> 00:24:28,98
that you know we had many friends and
selves who were in that category

371
00:24:28,98 --> 00:24:32,13
that we were actually in a majority
as distinct from minority when once

372
00:24:32,13 --> 00:24:36,12
that occurred. So the actual question
that it put a strain on relationships.

373
00:24:36,40 --> 00:24:39,20
Of course would put a
strain a you know a strain

374
00:24:39,20 --> 00:24:41,10
that nuclear families don't have

375
00:24:41,10 --> 00:24:44,14
but it also contributed so
much more to us as individuals

376
00:24:45,93 --> 00:24:50,05
and in a way i think it gave many of us
the freedom to move apart from each other

377
00:24:50,05 --> 00:24:55,09
and still try to start try to maintain
civil friendly relationships.

378
00:24:56,22 --> 00:25:01,10
You don't live with somebody for many
many years and then just suddenly stop

379
00:25:01,10 --> 00:25:03,72
and if you if you.

380
00:25:03,74 --> 00:25:06,89
Born children with somebody
you presumably i mean i'm

381
00:25:06,89 --> 00:25:11,66
and assuming everybody's fairly thoughtful
about their choices you presumably don't

382
00:25:11,66 --> 00:25:15,02
have kids with somebody who you think
that's a little bit more then shipped

383
00:25:15,02 --> 00:25:17,81
or not you know you actually
have some regard and love for

384
00:25:17,81 --> 00:25:20,48
that person at some stage
along the way and if

385
00:25:20,48 --> 00:25:23,26
that no longer is happening it doesn't
mean that you then have to hate

386
00:25:23,26 --> 00:25:26,17
that person or not not have regard
and respect for that person.

387
00:25:26,36 --> 00:25:29,06
So it may have may have
been a contributing factor.

388
00:25:29,45 --> 00:25:36,21
I don't i don't think so and contributing
factor in relationships ending.

389
00:25:36,22 --> 00:25:38,82
But i think it gave us the
opportunity to then go on

390
00:25:38,82 --> 00:25:42,80
and have respect for relationships with
our former partners who were often the

391
00:25:42,80 --> 00:25:49,62
parents of our children.

392
00:25:52,64 --> 00:25:56,99
Polygamy versus monogamy with
with those issues ever resolved.

393
00:25:57,01 --> 00:26:01,06
You know the answer to that that's a yes
and a no. I think for some individuals.

394
00:26:01,21 --> 00:26:04,30
We've been able to come to i mean to me.

395
00:26:04,32 --> 00:26:08,15
For example i have a fairly
clear attitude about my edit

396
00:26:08,15 --> 00:26:10,47
that my stance on it for others.

397
00:26:10,59 --> 00:26:12,28
I don't know whether
they've ever resolve them

398
00:26:12,28 --> 00:26:13,79
or whether it's even a problem for them

399
00:26:13,79 --> 00:26:18,28
and we certainly talked about as you
talk about incest within the snow.

400
00:26:18,30 --> 00:26:24,84
No not insist. Did not insist
that's another issue to talk about.

401
00:26:24,85 --> 00:26:29,03
We talk certainly we certainly encountered
as some of us had relationships with

402
00:26:29,03 --> 00:26:31,81
each other outside of our primary coupling

403
00:26:31,81 --> 00:26:35,26
and most of us were primarily
coupled i might say.

404
00:26:36,39 --> 00:26:40,47
And that created havoc and so there was
an agreement that that we would not do

405
00:26:40,47 --> 00:26:41,60
that.

406
00:26:41,61 --> 00:26:42,73
This is i'm talking about just

407
00:26:42,73 --> 00:26:46,10
that paradise valley i mean plenty of other
situations where people have done that.

408
00:26:46,23 --> 00:26:49,29
It just caused too much stress
and too much lack of trust

409
00:26:49,29 --> 00:26:51,86
and breaking down of too many of
the good things that occurred

410
00:26:51,86 --> 00:26:54,42
and some people never we
could never recovered.

411
00:26:54,45 --> 00:26:57,49
I don't think from some of those
events that the hurts were too great.

412
00:26:59,68 --> 00:27:03,17
And whether we didn't we talked
a lot about that. I mean.

413
00:27:03,18 --> 00:27:08,50
I think my attitude has always been.
I mean i'm a great. Imma go mahn.

414
00:27:08,51 --> 00:27:09,44
Fan

415
00:27:09,44 --> 00:27:13,24
and in the goldman was a feminist american
feminist from the early turn of the century

416
00:27:13,24 --> 00:27:14,53
but.

417
00:27:14,54 --> 00:27:20,10
Before that and century and into the
90s and she believed in free love

418
00:27:21,14 --> 00:27:22,87
and people to say you know
hippies and free love

419
00:27:22,87 --> 00:27:24,89
and i mean i think i do
believe in free love

420
00:27:24,89 --> 00:27:27,58
but i'd like to have the opportunity
to say what i mean by that.

421
00:27:27,73 --> 00:27:31,81
And by that i mean i think
people should be free to love

422
00:27:31,81 --> 00:27:35,80
and have intimate relationships including
sexually intimate relationships with

423
00:27:35,80 --> 00:27:40,97
anybody that they truly love as long
as it isn't hurtful to anybody else.

424
00:27:42,23 --> 00:27:43,18
And if that if

425
00:27:43,18 --> 00:27:47,06
that relationship is no longer truly loving
then it's presumably appropriate for

426
00:27:47,06 --> 00:27:48,80
that kind of intimacy to change.

427
00:27:49,03 --> 00:27:49,83
And if

428
00:27:49,83 --> 00:27:55,45
that person then forms another really close
bond with somebody else then they should

429
00:27:55,45 --> 00:27:59,64
be free to be able to exercise that or
live that relationship to its full.

430
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,08
Well if it which may also include
which may include sexual intimacy.

431
00:28:05,42 --> 00:28:07,28
So that's what i mean by free love.

432
00:28:07,41 --> 00:28:12,86
I don't really have any attachment to
people staying together for the kids for

433
00:28:12,86 --> 00:28:16,31
example i don't think that free love means

434
00:28:16,31 --> 00:28:19,85
that you don't make those choices
without a great deal of thought care

435
00:28:19,86 --> 00:28:26,50
and consideration. Building my own home.

436
00:28:26,52 --> 00:28:29,66
I'd like to tell you why
i built my own home.

437
00:28:31,25 --> 00:28:34,31
I'd started off my university
career as an architecture student

438
00:28:34,31 --> 00:28:38,39
and i decided i didn't want to be a
designer of ticky tacky little boxes

439
00:28:38,39 --> 00:28:43,13
and maybe putting pink or gray
color schemes rather than blue

440
00:28:43,13 --> 00:28:46,77
and brown into government
toilets and things like that.

441
00:28:46,85 --> 00:28:49,57
I mean i was an i was
raised in the era of watson

442
00:28:49,57 --> 00:28:52,85
and i realize i miss i was sick tech you
know i would just be a very ordinary

443
00:28:52,85 --> 00:28:57,40
architect. I didn't think i was really
spectacular in the architecture.

444
00:28:57,42 --> 00:29:01,25
So i decided not to continue with architecture
so i decided i'd really like to be a

445
00:29:01,25 --> 00:29:03,66
carpenter and i went along
applied to do carpentry

446
00:29:03,66 --> 00:29:07,78
and joinery through the
type system and was told

447
00:29:07,78 --> 00:29:14,34
that there weren't enough toilets which i
didn't exactly understand since part of

448
00:29:14,34 --> 00:29:15,94
that story is that they
thought i was missed.

449
00:29:15,97 --> 00:29:20,77
I thought they thought i was mrs. watson
coming along for my dutch speaking husband

450
00:29:20,77 --> 00:29:23,23
who couldn't understand
english when it became clear

451
00:29:23,23 --> 00:29:27,17
that i was actually jammed all
over and i wanted to do carpentry

452
00:29:27,17 --> 00:29:31,08
and joinery then i found out that they
were not enough to put it in the college

453
00:29:31,08 --> 00:29:32,19
and i didn't really think

454
00:29:32,19 --> 00:29:35,55
that this particular bureaucratic
problem had much to do with me

455
00:29:35,55 --> 00:29:37,82
and then i realised what the message was

456
00:29:37,82 --> 00:29:40,99
that we don't want women
girls doing architect.

457
00:29:41,02 --> 00:29:44,45
Doing carpentry enjoying we don't
want girls doing carpentry injuries.

458
00:29:44,60 --> 00:29:46,63
So i sort of.

459
00:29:46,65 --> 00:29:49,92
Was a bit overcome and i very sheepishly
sort of crawled away from that.

460
00:29:51,04 --> 00:29:51,81
So i guess you could say

461
00:29:51,81 --> 00:29:56,57
that i had this deep seated desire to be
involved with building from a very early

462
00:29:56,57 --> 00:29:59,93
age and when i moved to the.

463
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:01,56
Country it was an opportunity to fulfill

464
00:30:01,56 --> 00:30:04,68
that i went into industrial design
after that and psychiatric nursing

465
00:30:04,68 --> 00:30:08,58
and all sorts of things but
when i moved to the country.

466
00:30:08,59 --> 00:30:11,29
He was my opportunity to
become involved in buildings.

467
00:30:11,49 --> 00:30:13,41
So i was very passionately and

468
00:30:13,41 --> 00:30:17,24
and closely involved with the buildings
of our forces the building of our first

469
00:30:17,24 --> 00:30:19,93
house which was our large extended house

470
00:30:21,30 --> 00:30:24,29
and i found it very tiring

471
00:30:24,29 --> 00:30:28,77
and almost impossible to build physically
while i was pregnant with cell.

472
00:30:28,99 --> 00:30:32,62
I suffered a great deal of twenty
five hour day morning nausea surely

473
00:30:32,62 --> 00:30:34,51
and i'll turn.

474
00:30:35,22 --> 00:30:37,50
And i did a lot of the organization
a lot of decision making

475
00:30:37,50 --> 00:30:42,70
but i didn't do much hands on
stuff. When sally and john is dead.

476
00:30:42,85 --> 00:30:48,41
John and i decided to separate and
move further apart from each other.

477
00:30:49,56 --> 00:30:52,24
The obvious solution came
to me one day and that was

478
00:30:52,24 --> 00:30:53,51
that i should build my own space

479
00:30:54,29 --> 00:30:57,92
and i can relate to the community how
still as long as we had our own spices we

480
00:30:57,92 --> 00:31:03,51
were could co-parent the kids underneath
the same sort of. Under the same half.

481
00:31:03,69 --> 00:31:05,36
I mean you know under half but anyway.

482
00:31:05,40 --> 00:31:08,92
And so i decided to call myself a
house or announce to the family

483
00:31:09,72 --> 00:31:11,69
that that's what i was going
to do and everybody went home.

484
00:31:12,31 --> 00:31:14,85
So i did and i set myself a time limit.

485
00:31:16,28 --> 00:31:21,29
I decided i would build a house in 12 months
working three days a week which meant.

486
00:31:21,56 --> 00:31:24,89
I needed to arrange three days
child free time to do that.

487
00:31:24,98 --> 00:31:28,30
So i did so it was interesting for me
because lots of issues were involved.

488
00:31:28,74 --> 00:31:32,89
It was me as a young mother beginning
to negotiate child free time.

489
00:31:32,90 --> 00:31:38,10
Although we were very committed to the
notion of us all being equal i was

490
00:31:38,10 --> 00:31:39,85
discovering that once you had children.

491
00:31:40,84 --> 00:31:44,52
A lot of those ideas sort of
slipped out the door a bit.

492
00:31:44,55 --> 00:31:48,18
It was one of the issues for me
but i wanted to have that in

493
00:31:48,18 --> 00:31:49,51
that respect of equality.
