there until it cut out but it had not had

50
00:05:20,37 --> 00:05:25,15
a head and started somewhere
else and later on. I've gone

51
00:05:26,80 --> 00:05:31,80
concern with the work going on at the bridge
where there is to turn off right well

52
00:05:31,80 --> 00:05:36,94
we were well. And found out about mr.

53
00:05:36,94 --> 00:05:39,62
Sinclair's name on choir about

54
00:05:39,62 --> 00:05:46,08
a job and that later on of this got sound
and had how i started to work on the

55
00:05:46,08 --> 00:05:51,91
bridge. I went and seen him and he said
you can start in the morning next day and

56
00:05:51,91 --> 00:05:53,39
he sent into remission. Mr.

57
00:05:53,39 --> 00:05:56,63
Breen and i stopped there for quite

58
00:05:56,64 --> 00:06:03,37
a while until we come out on
strike and that he sent me

59
00:06:12,78 --> 00:06:19,66
out on i think that is correct.
Next morning i started called

60
00:06:19,66 --> 00:06:25,36
and jack brain and jack brain was
the man in the operation. It was

61
00:06:25,36 --> 00:06:32,28
a very much and and gent
my aunt do you know.

62
00:06:34,13 --> 00:06:39,63
Charlie finally he was in charge of the
rigors and i'd had ability to be injured

63
00:06:39,63 --> 00:06:43,57
and of reagan and they went around and.

64
00:06:46,84 --> 00:06:49,04
How other man. We were in

65
00:06:49,04 --> 00:06:55,05
a box where would you call and.

66
00:06:57,65 --> 00:06:57,93
Or like

67
00:06:57,93 --> 00:07:07,25
a cage biographical. And our
names although i believe

68
00:07:07,26 --> 00:07:10,32
black all came from tasmania.

69
00:07:16,03 --> 00:07:21,51
Bob david come from our summer away

70
00:07:24,65 --> 00:07:30,30
. Max

71
00:07:32,82 --> 00:07:38,22
and my show. Jack munro where did make
certain come from. Do they were free money

72
00:07:38,22 --> 00:07:44,53
come from england. I did worry it was
down and sydney i don't know that i would

73
00:07:44,53 --> 00:07:44,79
live in

74
00:07:44,79 --> 00:07:53,80
a crow's nest. Anyway. Was that where
your aunt lived and where and. I

75
00:07:53,81 --> 00:07:56,69
remained in that job for quite

76
00:07:56,70 --> 00:08:00,39
a while. So what do you did you start
you think about only twenty six or

77
00:08:00,39 --> 00:08:01,45
twenty seven was it due to

78
00:08:01,45 --> 00:08:07,79
a disease. How only twenty seven and

79
00:08:08,92 --> 00:08:14,75
what did you do actually do in the job. I
went straight end of the reagan. So what

80
00:08:14,75 --> 00:08:21,45
was the job. What you have to actually do
either general joe did but emotionally i

81
00:08:21,45 --> 00:08:28,38
was mostly look i'm after
the crane man with

82
00:08:28,38 --> 00:08:35,26
a bill. You know the

83
00:08:35,26 --> 00:08:40,21
cream driver's name and i'm trying
to think of it knowing very well.

84
00:08:44,22 --> 00:08:49,08
Was that the one that you said lift the the
stone off of the ships or was it one up

85
00:08:49,08 --> 00:08:52,63
on the top then he was
up top. I mean. Mostly

86
00:08:58,02 --> 00:09:04,33
charlie riche you've got your own charlie
riche and i remain with them and tell

87
00:09:05,32 --> 00:09:11,93
trust i am as i know i. Which came
to me give. When you actually

88
00:09:11,93 --> 00:09:16,29
used to act as dogman for that green driver
would you do you ride the load all the

89
00:09:16,29 --> 00:09:19,04
time. Oh wait. Mostly they have

90
00:09:19,04 --> 00:09:25,50
a lot. Tenant of em all the time and ride
their load or not. Did you right on top

91
00:09:25,50 --> 00:09:26,47
of the low. I stood on

92
00:09:26,47 --> 00:09:33,29
a loud no and waited up. Under the
supervision of charlie campbell and how high

93
00:09:34,36 --> 00:09:38,69
or whatever heights they were working on
here might be mantra for leadership the

94
00:09:38,69 --> 00:09:44,77
crane you see if you only take it in spasm.
That's on the on the on the approaches

95
00:09:44,77 --> 00:09:49,04
or on the lot itself when it
started to go up but not on

96
00:09:55,28 --> 00:09:56,77
what you call it there. I've got

97
00:09:56,77 --> 00:10:01,38
a photo of it in there and you want the
pylon is it. When you leave the pile of

98
00:10:01,38 --> 00:10:03,06
matter vag. I was

99
00:10:03,06 --> 00:10:08,65
a own help to screw up the nut
should i go to the pylon with

100
00:10:08,65 --> 00:10:13,75
a big big spanner i never forget
that day. And now i don't.

101
00:10:17,42 --> 00:10:21,44
And you were on the approach spends as
well. Working on the proto pens in sit in

102
00:10:21,44 --> 00:10:26,45
the city. Weren't you the side. I
started and doors point. Had we had

103
00:10:26,45 --> 00:10:33,40
a welcome. And we laid
every layer the rails for

104
00:10:33,40 --> 00:10:39,34
the for the for the crane
that drive the trolls on

105
00:10:41,19 --> 00:10:45,60
to do. Did the carpenters build up beforehand
you remember the carpenters working

106
00:10:45,60 --> 00:10:50,59
there and i knew them. I knew them
personally. Yeah that was false. Work it was

107
00:10:50,59 --> 00:10:54,33
taken away afterwards was not that a pull
it all down and actually had a build

108
00:10:54,33 --> 00:11:01,29
a bridge of hollywood could do the
steel work. Do you remember actually

109
00:11:01,29 --> 00:11:08,02
how they did that you member them doing
it. Did you. That tembo work. Yes well

110
00:11:08,02 --> 00:11:14,67
that was our special gang of more
or less but we helped. And overhead

111
00:11:14,68 --> 00:11:17,51
part of that. Nina never have

112
00:11:17,51 --> 00:11:22,39
a gantry along the side to walk along the
street because you don't get the other

113
00:11:22,39 --> 00:11:25,93
men were going to barbee a little what
we used to call a steelworkers at

114
00:11:25,93 --> 00:11:28,37
a river which was quite

115
00:11:28,37 --> 00:11:33,47
a lot. And i still remember once like
there's no matter of fact i don't know what

116
00:11:33,47 --> 00:11:39,08
he's gone. How many belonged really the
club and sydney where i. And afterwards.

117
00:11:40,01 --> 00:11:46,73
Where where i belong to this day is the
new shout way old room ladies club.

118
00:11:48,49 --> 00:11:55,19
So it was his name. Jim
you know i know i'm

119
00:11:55,19 --> 00:12:02,17
sure. Well you know no way

120
00:12:02,17 --> 00:12:04,54
to letting their i have

121
00:12:04,55 --> 00:12:10,61
a moan. I can't i can't think of something
else and durable did you know any of the

122
00:12:10,61 --> 00:12:14,56
other steel workers at all the metal workers
you member jack mccrae he worked on

123
00:12:14,56 --> 00:12:21,22
the pile on hand member him job
he did. Oh general. I mean.

124
00:12:22,13 --> 00:12:27,41
Well you can say well nearly all
labors were not when we had

125
00:12:27,41 --> 00:12:31,98
a go where directed but i'm i was i more
or less but then the one going all the

126
00:12:31,98 --> 00:12:38,40
time. And shorten and story are
up until the day all is down.

127
00:12:38,51 --> 00:12:44,28
Who's to come and elevators up and then
go on down into the abutment shortage of

128
00:12:44,28 --> 00:12:49,65
correct word. And that was pretty
fleet under the harbor and i took

129
00:12:49,65 --> 00:12:56,64
a hundred tons of concrete in there. And

130
00:12:57,39 --> 00:13:00,19
were you working at that time on
only out one day they were even

131
00:13:00,19 --> 00:13:04,00
a block and that was
tear and bags recommend

132
00:13:04,72 --> 00:13:10,86
a tremendous open that all i done. And
i recall this one once while i worked

133
00:13:11,92 --> 00:13:17,72
with it. Over the period of
time i got up to ninety nine

134
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:19,37
buckets

135
00:13:19,37 --> 00:13:26,29
a day of life. That's concrete and skips
you. And you can call it what you like

136
00:13:26,29 --> 00:13:33,09
our money trying to think you know
he is people we are now. And we

137
00:13:33,09 --> 00:13:39,68
come on about about three tana left
and i as they got was ninety nine

138
00:13:39,68 --> 00:13:46,37
lives of ships. You know
day she was surrounded and

139
00:13:46,37 --> 00:13:53,28
a lot. But they never got 100.
That was before they got off

140
00:13:53,29 --> 00:14:00,05
the ground level was this cuba acts.
Yeah cuba and they went down into the

141
00:14:00,05 --> 00:14:04,72
rock and rock solid
what you call strollers

142
00:14:09,37 --> 00:14:16,32
samson own. Do you remember them digging
the tunnels for the for the cables

143
00:14:16,32 --> 00:14:22,95
to the hell they're doing
their. Yes. Now adam there

144
00:14:22,95 --> 00:14:28,98
but need to describe them

145
00:14:30,17 --> 00:14:36,69
very hard and it's something
that he can't talk

146
00:14:36,69 --> 00:14:41,33
quick on drugs. You remember
it took a long time to build

147
00:14:41,33 --> 00:14:44,94
a bridge and you could only do
it and have it done against

148
00:14:44,94 --> 00:14:51,84
a day in lengthy work i reckon
they were pretty smart. You

149
00:14:51,85 --> 00:14:58,75
know that's only in in time. Yes
you know what else what else

150
00:14:58,75 --> 00:15:03,61
were you involved in do you think about
from the two you responsible for lifting up

151
00:15:04,58 --> 00:15:09,19
the steel worker. No i had nothing to
do with a steel nothing to do with

152
00:15:09,19 --> 00:15:13,49
a known. I stopped and that gang were all
of us together. What about this loan were

153
00:15:14,21 --> 00:15:21,11
the maria stern that used to come
off the ships involved with ed only

154
00:15:21,12 --> 00:15:27,85
and the senate types down there which
was sixteen ton in what we went up to.

155
00:15:27,87 --> 00:15:31,92
Selected and this was a main
part of our work. I thought it

156
00:15:31,92 --> 00:15:38,65
a great honor to take for men. I'd
put michelle the demand then of

157
00:15:38,65 --> 00:15:39,00
running

158
00:15:46,49 --> 00:15:53,37
to be our job or to lift the red block

159
00:15:54,94 --> 00:16:00,32
rig blocks and this would work came from
the from the mill and we had there by the

160
00:16:00,32 --> 00:16:07,32
carpenters correct the
block which was to live

161
00:16:07,32 --> 00:16:14,26
this main down was left we've all
get on it but the senate how

162
00:16:15,59 --> 00:16:21,16
they call today in my own place and mine
by sunni and we were sent up they are

163
00:16:21,16 --> 00:16:27,97
selected to do not for direct the
blocks which were to attempt ten ton

164
00:16:27,97 --> 00:16:34,43
blogs to live that. Up had lowered into
place. That's the all star and it's

165
00:16:35,13 --> 00:16:41,80
a big one. And to remove the
stonemason who was working with you. I

166
00:16:41,80 --> 00:16:46,94
don't know and they were all scotchwoman
