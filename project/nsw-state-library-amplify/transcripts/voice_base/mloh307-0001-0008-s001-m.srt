1
00:00:18,1 --> 00:00:29,9
We are aware of this station eight recorded in Sydney on Tuesday the twenty ninth of July nine hundred ninety seven

2
00:00:31,75 --> 00:00:49,6
and great talking to fate. Where up to. Yes we are indeed. So after the very liked night at the club.

3
00:00:51,29 --> 00:00:57,87
They told us that they wanted a couple of us to go out

4
00:00:57,87 --> 00:01:08,5
and fitted three children the orphans of the participants who fought. And so they called for us picked us up.

5
00:01:09,48 --> 00:01:23,92
And the first place. We stopped it was a cemetery. And not very far from the symmetry was. And these children were all.

6
00:01:23,94 --> 00:01:33,52
Five six year olds and they may have mentioned this before but in case I didn't.

7
00:01:33,55 --> 00:01:37,74
I'll just say that they took us to the symmetry of the children's fathers

8
00:01:39,17 --> 00:01:47,21
and told us how the Germans had cut their heads off and put their heads sticks.

9
00:01:47,86 --> 00:01:54,76
And asked to go on identify their husbands.

10
00:01:54,78 --> 00:02:04,75
And so they brought very close to all the children who were left with our parents where they have to file for us

11
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:13,72
and some of the mothers were came along and created us. I mean to pick up they too old to leave the children.

12
00:02:15,39 --> 00:02:31,16
And so we. Some time. You know all the children. With little bug. Waiting for us so we left we went to our pottery.

13
00:02:31,76 --> 00:02:44,38
And I'd always heard about pottery. And this was a place where people who were really known as peasants lived.

14
00:02:44,65 --> 00:02:57,67
They lived from the land and it was a very hard existence of course for them. But they had they killed. Hugh.

15
00:02:57,68 --> 00:03:14,4
And other Africans for food where they put their bread in so on. And that was about one hundred from.

16
00:03:14,92 --> 00:03:20,25
The first place which caught out and then told us or not been more

17
00:03:20,25 --> 00:03:32,51
but it was a very long long tricked over mountains and valleys and finally we got told us.

18
00:03:32,52 --> 00:03:40,52
How they were virtually untouched by the war because they were cut off from the cities. And.

19
00:03:40,54 --> 00:03:52,84
But were certainly very aware of. There in photographs and lift presents and i gave me a present.

20
00:03:58,37 --> 00:04:12,57
A sample of their pottery four beautiful cups and saucers and four very small four black coffee coffee a beautiful.

21
00:04:13,05 --> 00:04:32,55
Cocoa jug. It was. Well. And that was given to me. OPEC up nicely. There were other pieces in it as well. Anyhow.

22
00:04:32,57 --> 00:04:45,86
We had a very said it had been converted actually into a co-operative. And all of the fire this.

23
00:04:45,88 --> 00:04:56,49
Pool in the vegetables and fruit and I said I found that far more profitable than taking it to the markets in town.

24
00:04:57,21 --> 00:05:12,99
There was a lot of battering. So then we left and went to a government co-operative and that was a huge huge.

25
00:05:14,07 --> 00:05:24,67
Was the type of. A very very long table. And that I had made it.

26
00:05:24,73 --> 00:05:36,98
Kerry using the wonderful capsicums beautiful lot of Chile caps to my heart. Cucumber.

27
00:05:38,81 --> 00:05:43,39
And basically a vegetarian curry but huge huge bowls of hurt.

28
00:05:43,9 --> 00:05:50,39
Well put on the table brought in steaming coffee and huge beholds of potato.

29
00:05:52,07 --> 00:06:01,41
Boiled potatoes he said went with Terry and. We all sat down with the leaders of the co-op.

30
00:06:02,09 --> 00:06:09,09
And over here hanging answers of. Chile.

31
00:06:09,11 --> 00:06:16,7
They were dry the whole ceiling looked radiant green with these beautiful bunches of chilies and capsicum.

32
00:06:17,24 --> 00:06:23,00
Hanging the country for capsicums like Hungary Hungary and.

33
00:06:23,01 --> 00:06:30,06
We had a wonderful meal there and they brought in a bazooka.

34
00:06:32,17 --> 00:06:38,73
I say we sang with them we staying together we did a dance for them.

35
00:06:38,75 --> 00:06:48,08
It was just wonderful wonderful beautiful feeling of. Genuine comradeship.

36
00:06:48,59 --> 00:06:59,2
And as we really presented us once again there were many persons maybe prisons but in particular the bars.

37
00:06:59,25 --> 00:07:06,42
Blair House which had been hand. Of the most beautiful creams.

38
00:07:07,04 --> 00:07:17,9
And it was a traditional traditional as you know and they have not blackouts and that have you brought it sleeve for

39
00:07:17,91 --> 00:07:25,77
and. Just beautiful and they gave I was with an Australian free. And she was very fear.

40
00:07:26,32 --> 00:07:38,27
So they gave her the blouse with a pink and green tree and they gave me with the red and orange tree was a lovely.

41
00:07:38,29 --> 00:07:39,01
Just lovely.

42
00:07:39,24 --> 00:07:49,48
Well by then you know I could have gone on for hours on end we went through the fire and the women were very.

43
00:07:54,36 --> 00:07:59,28
Who and welcoming and they touched us they just wanted to touch us.

44
00:07:59,73 --> 00:08:06,75
We touched him and that was the exchange you know because the language was a great barrier.

45
00:08:06,98 --> 00:08:13,49
Although we had interpreters with language was a barrier with because of which are so many people

46
00:08:14,48 --> 00:08:21,8
and then we went back to the city. And then the next day they said to me. Well.

47
00:08:23,17 --> 00:08:36,17
We had a wonderful leader and his name was Judy Dimitroff. Well I had read a lot about your duty mantra. And he was.

48
00:08:37,32 --> 00:08:44,75
Wilfred Burchett the Australian journalist had a bit to do with him and was a great admirer of Demetra. Well.

49
00:08:45,21 --> 00:08:56,75
Dimeter of course was a Communist Party you know what he did was lift the people out of the terrible poverty they were

50
00:08:56,75 --> 00:09:01,94
in. Any had asked me if I would like to go and see the house he lived in a city.

51
00:09:02,52 --> 00:09:12,87
So we went off to see his house and it was. And what people try of had I mean Sion this because I want to remember.

52
00:09:13,41 --> 00:09:18,95
One of his great achievements was to banish the common bowl.

53
00:09:18,97 --> 00:09:24,69
And they're on the little table in his little eating room cottage the with so many bells

54
00:09:25,7 --> 00:09:30,6
and one bowl in the center saying that for us.

55
00:09:34,97 --> 00:09:45,6
How many if you went to bag area of the original delegation that for very small. Yes.

56
00:09:46,88 --> 00:09:57,64
So then we were put on the train for great celebrations again and the best local band was there to.

57
00:09:57,66 --> 00:10:00,39
Play us on the train.

58
00:10:00,41 --> 00:10:02,46
And one of things that interested me

59
00:10:03,31 --> 00:10:11,59
and consoled me somewhat that I was we traveled all the way from Bulgaria changing trains at different stations going

60
00:10:11,59 --> 00:10:20,29
right on to Paris. I noticed in the Eastern Bloc. I had three.

61
00:10:20,3 --> 00:10:23,81
Compartment three classes of travel

62
00:10:23,81 --> 00:10:29,36
and I thought oh mighty I thought it was all about banishing the class system you know.

63
00:10:29,71 --> 00:10:39,9
And so there were three Army offices in the beautiful plush first US and then we were also in first class

64
00:10:39,9 --> 00:10:43,95
but not quite as plush and then the hearse.

65
00:10:44,93 --> 00:10:50,27
I suppose what we did I would call economy where business people appeared to be travelling.

66
00:10:50,52 --> 00:11:02,21
You know they had briefcases and out in the corridor packed packed the corridors where the poor people.

67
00:11:03,04 --> 00:11:16,43
And they would you're sitting on top of their bags of wheat or whatever it was sitting on the. Blankets.

68
00:11:16,45 --> 00:11:29,17
Everyone had a huge round loaf of bread tacked under their arms which away from you and I looked desperately.

69
00:11:29,19 --> 00:11:42,55
Not hungry but had put had put. So I thought well you know I'm not of you sure about this. Classless society.

70
00:11:42,56 --> 00:11:50,48
So we went back through the his beautiful country. Beautiful country. Went to Paris.

71
00:11:50,49 --> 00:11:58,21
I stayed on in Paris for a little while. Mainly because I couldn't pay myself away from it.

72
00:11:59,23 --> 00:12:13,95
Just booking the streets just loving it. And finally I got on the train who went to Cali and after. Those two.

73
00:12:15,09 --> 00:12:20,14
And then I went up to London. And joined up with the rest of the delegation in London.

74
00:12:20,68 --> 00:12:30,15
And they were all living in cheap dives because money was running out of paper you know why for. Nearly six months.

75
00:12:30,17 --> 00:12:42,99
And I was cheap if I had nothing else I wanted. Because winter was coming on. And finally I put myself into it.

76
00:12:44,16 --> 00:12:56,94
In Bloomsbury. It was such a thought nothing flashy of course but you know. Nineteen fifty one.

77
00:12:57,06 --> 00:13:01,98
It was and sure you still had to walk in the passage way to the Danny and so forth

78
00:13:01,98 --> 00:13:07,05
but that was luxury compared with what my other friends were living in.

79
00:13:07,74 --> 00:13:11,72
And some were social some of had flights and as many as seven

80
00:13:11,72 --> 00:13:17,29
and I had all opted just to wait until a boat was to leave you. So you know it wasn't leaving until December.

81
00:13:17,77 --> 00:13:26,31
Midwinter. Anyhow I was in this lovely comfortable in Bloomsbury.

82
00:13:26,33 --> 00:13:34,59
And once again I made with my engineering friend from Whole been told you about.

83
00:13:35,76 --> 00:13:40,94
The cold call it caught who had been coming over to London.

84
00:13:40,95 --> 00:13:50,85
And his wife Beth had come to join him she'd gone off somewhere I think she went to Moscow before she went on to London.

85
00:13:50,87 --> 00:14:02,4
And there was a journalist acquaintance of his by the name of Mark. And I met the three of them. And they said to me.

86
00:14:02,71 --> 00:14:14,38
Listen if I did. We're going to buy a car. And you. In a day or two we're going up to Bedford to get it.

87
00:14:14,4 --> 00:14:23,06
And these cars were just on the market. British javelin and they pooled the money they had could get.

88
00:14:24,02 --> 00:14:27,2
And now having gone through the east we're going through that waste.

89
00:14:27,67 --> 00:14:33,5
If you throw in for food and petrol and pay here and accommodation when we left.

90
00:14:33,51 --> 00:14:44,05
Accommodation will come with us so that won't happen got the car like came back and we went to the markets.

91
00:14:45,3 --> 00:14:56,54
To buy food in London or so cheap leaving cheap like thousands of keepers and sardines all that stuff

92
00:14:56,54 --> 00:15:01,43
and that was just what we wanted and New Zealand care and better.

93
00:15:03,7 --> 00:15:10,57
So we went to the markets and we filled the boxes boat a Primus

94
00:15:11,61 --> 00:15:25,56
and methylated kerosene all those things you need to get the promise caring for. And then I said well we were.

95
00:15:27,68 --> 00:15:28,17
Under the Stars.

96
00:15:30,13 --> 00:15:39,45
And sure enough so that I had been to a disposal shop I don't know who you're too young to remember the disposal shops

97
00:15:39,45 --> 00:15:44,34
but after the war we had big disposal shops that were selling for stuff.

98
00:15:44,83 --> 00:15:53,33
And people voted because you know particularly people who were building houses because they came over the hill to see

99
00:15:53,33 --> 00:16:01,2
so and they had both a parachute number one. They would ready.

100
00:16:01,33 --> 00:16:12,85
We all had sleeping bags and various pieces of canvas and what if you and I said they have it.

101
00:16:12,87 --> 00:16:22,34
So we got into this brand new javelin and we set our. It was so beautiful I will never forget it.

102
00:16:22,47 --> 00:16:29,59
I had to pinch myself to tell me it was true. First stop was. Paris.

103
00:16:31,47 --> 00:16:40,39
And we were going to that occasionally we'd have a me an evening meal a cheap evening meal while best French was very

104
00:16:40,39 --> 00:16:51,6
good. So we went looking for an evening meal and we went over a structure which was on the list.

105
00:16:51,61 --> 00:17:04,65
And it had a very limited menu. And it had. Made which was cooked in WA. And Rice wasn't anything else.

106
00:17:06,21 --> 00:17:15,7
So we all got stuck into this and eating meat you know it was still rationed in England and so on. Great luxury.

107
00:17:15,72 --> 00:17:22,28
So we got stuck into this rice and meat. And we paid. And we left.

108
00:17:22,43 --> 00:17:30,73
Well this business of tipping where it is in Australia is relatively new to people of my age.

109
00:17:30,74 --> 00:17:36,55
Because there was a time when you wouldn't dream of tipping only that people who were into the Australian

110
00:17:36,55 --> 00:17:45,41
and princes and Ramallah. Believed in tipping. And I have to say that Hanson I agreed. We're never going to tip again.

111
00:17:45,43 --> 00:17:58,25
And we didn't last night. So of course we didn't. And we saw Paris. I wanted to live. And we it was like.

112
00:17:58,89 --> 00:18:01,4
I thought it was the most beautiful city on it.

113
00:18:02,22 --> 00:18:11,63
So then we said we're getting hungry so let's go back to our restaurant again and we are sure that wouldn't serve us.

114
00:18:12,74 --> 00:18:15,7
Now that's it. And this is where our.

115
00:18:17,09 --> 00:18:26,8
No that's not no I did it was a vote even though she said I would give you a little bit will give you a little bit

116
00:18:26,8 --> 00:18:30,4
about an inch. But.

117
00:18:30,42 --> 00:18:45,89
So we had to go and buy food into the markets and bought food on the players and got the promise it had started.

118
00:18:45,91 --> 00:18:53,19
Cooking the potato is when the cops and I was making the baby it's you know put it. You put them.

119
00:18:53,21 --> 00:19:04,99
Parachute proof and we idea was to lie on some rocks then hop in your sleeping bag and you're right.

120
00:19:07,43 --> 00:19:16,47
The cops should not torture. And this is now you can stay here. This is a public park it can't come.

121
00:19:16,49 --> 00:19:25,00
So we said we're moving hard Could we stay for that night and. They looked at us and. We told them we're not English.

122
00:19:25,24 --> 00:19:27,83
We were not American but Australian

123
00:19:27,83 --> 00:19:33,93
and they were rather fascinated with this for us trillions camping in whatever asked cities.

124
00:19:34,79 --> 00:19:37,53
You know you can stay there.

125
00:19:37,57 --> 00:19:43,88
No Ari but go early in the morning when we're all of us left early in the morning because it was said.

126
00:19:43,94 --> 00:19:46,2
Lovely to see the place in the early hours.

127
00:19:46,58 --> 00:19:56,66
So we've potatoes at night and tin of herrings or whatever it was the next morning we pushed off

128
00:19:56,66 --> 00:20:05,58
but we muster stayed I think about leaving a week just seeing as much as we could and then we drove down from there.

129
00:20:11,17 --> 00:20:17,04
We went through he says to me. And over to Austria again.

130
00:20:18,3 --> 00:20:25,11
And we just stayed one night camping in the hand and went on to Salzburg.

131
00:20:25,13 --> 00:20:29,88
And we were sitting up camp on the outskirts of selves.

132
00:20:30,62 --> 00:20:39,28
You know my job was always make that we just put the Big Gram covering down

133
00:20:39,28 --> 00:20:45,7
and then we'd all just lie on it because it prevented the cull come from coming through hopping to us splitting the

134
00:20:45,7 --> 00:20:52,76
eggs and we would just have to get it to behave. When the cops came. And I said.

135
00:20:52,77 --> 00:21:07,85
And but you haven't wasn't too bad they are now on television. And they said Now you come. This is just not so nice it.

136
00:21:09,66 --> 00:21:20,28
Will go very very early in the morning or I said but don't think you know it's been very quiet. Good night.

137
00:21:20,3 --> 00:21:29,49
Then we had a life with a radio with no use and we'd sleep in a sleeping bag.

138
00:21:29,51 --> 00:21:33,53
Just for you to for it to rain while we threw the Macintosh over also.

139
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:40,15
So we stayed in cells but and didn't like it for some reason or other.

140
00:21:40,58 --> 00:21:49,83
You know there was still a strong smell of the Nazis. And of course a were very.

141
00:21:51,33 --> 00:22:01,5
Very much in lanes to sell spur that's why this is in the area of Hitler's beginnings.

142
00:22:02,08 --> 00:22:07,39
So we didn't stay awfully long there was summer another place and feeling about it all.

143
00:22:07,42 --> 00:22:14,86
I must say it was had to leave the beauty of it but then we said we'll go over the last climb Gloucester up

144
00:22:14,86 --> 00:22:19,94
and go right over and come down. And we did just.

145
00:22:20,51 --> 00:22:29,18
So we set off from the roof to leave in the morning and we took all the bedding we had with us in the car.

146
00:22:30,71 --> 00:22:43,28
Because the car didn't have heat. And. It was practically a food. Right up to the very peak you were in the next day.

147
00:22:43,6 --> 00:22:51,26
Well when we reached the peak of the Alps. We couldn't get half for Tarika at all.

148
00:22:51,4 --> 00:23:03,91
We just had to look out and there were many. Snow. Coverage snow clearing the roads.

149
00:23:04,28 --> 00:23:13,35
So we had to take it slowly of course. And we said to the workman. Cafes.

150
00:23:13,36 --> 00:23:17,94
And they said no you don't have to go to the bottom of the helps.

151
00:23:18,15 --> 00:23:23,94
And there is a resupply and we think you can get some nice hot soup there.

152
00:23:23,95 --> 00:23:30,1
So all the while he was there I think for the hot soup and family were in Iraq.

153
00:23:30,39 --> 00:23:41,16
And there was a little cafe right at the gate on the border and when she said can you have soup pancakes we suggest.

154
00:23:42,55 --> 00:23:52,87
There were fire pancakes filled with potato. Why do you do it is that it was the last crumb of this.

155
00:23:52,9 --> 00:24:03,06
I mean if we were under if now coffee I'm not heard of heard of milk cows there

156
00:24:03,06 --> 00:24:08,83
and they could have it's much milk with its would like to drink.

157
00:24:08,85 --> 00:24:30,9
We have just got stuck in the heat in the milk and that was a. So we're at the bottom of the mountain.

158
00:24:30,92 --> 00:24:45,04
So we were pleased to cross into Italy. And. It was a little more. Because it had. I'm sorry.

159
00:24:45,18 --> 00:24:47,59
I've just got to come back in case I forget this.

160
00:24:47,9 --> 00:25:00,67
I want to say that when we lift France and we were traveling through western Germany. We spent some time in Western.

161
00:25:00,68 --> 00:25:10,29
And color. We went and saw the destruction to the cathedral which was a magnificent thing.

162
00:25:11,79 --> 00:25:22,7
But I recall going to the group still works. Which were in either cologne and I'll have to check that out.

163
00:25:24,64 --> 00:25:34,16
And we went as the workers were finished the shift was finishing for the day this was in the month of early November.

164
00:25:34,17 --> 00:25:44,8
And the cold had started very much. And the workers were coming out from the the works. Dragging the souls of the.

165
00:25:45,56 --> 00:25:57,27
And the hymn of their trousers. Poverty stricken. Looking so desperately beaten beaten. And.

166
00:25:58,72 --> 00:26:06,26
We stopped outside to stop a car outside of the gate. One man was on. Said to him.

167
00:26:06,27 --> 00:26:18,06
Do you work here now and he said yes and this is the crop who are still works. Do they pay you well. Is that good.

168
00:26:19,69 --> 00:26:30,41
It's very bad and I had some cigarettes in his pocket. Put a cigarette in his math and offered it to the. Work.

169
00:26:31,91 --> 00:26:44,8
And the work. Reluctantly to could but graceful. You know cigarettes a cigarette would have been quite a luxury quite.

170
00:26:45,79 --> 00:27:03,47
And it was going through. And then we went to.

171
00:27:03,49 --> 00:27:11,07
And going to Heidelberg was quite an experience because it still somehow or other retained a lot of its beauty.

172
00:27:11,21 --> 00:27:15,21
It didn't seem to me to be as devastated as the other city.

173
00:27:15,6 --> 00:27:21,87
It could well have been but the surroundings were very very beautiful very beautiful.

174
00:27:22,53 --> 00:27:28,56
And then we said well we must go through the Black Forest always has the Black Forest

175
00:27:29,49 --> 00:27:36,68
and I guess that was the only uncomfortable night we had on the whole trip. We didn't realise it would be so cold.

176
00:27:36,92 --> 00:27:42,34
We found. Hunters hat with the hunters.

177
00:27:43,18 --> 00:27:51,3
And we were able to make a fire but that was totally inadequate to keep ourselves.

178
00:27:53,41 --> 00:28:06,53
We left very early the next morning from their travel and then we went to the. Edge of the rock for quite some time.

179
00:28:09,92 --> 00:28:22,01
I remember looking and seeing the lower. She looked. And then of course who went over to Austria.

180
00:28:22,16 --> 00:28:26,85
But I just wanted to remember having gone to the cripple.

181
00:28:28,45 --> 00:28:38,87
They were working already in valley and you might remember that it was croup who made the poisonous gas gas.

182
00:28:39,78 --> 00:28:48,44
So we arrived in Italy and it was an entirely different atmosphere. I've already seen an awful lot of Italy growing up.

183
00:28:49,68 --> 00:28:55,32
And I knew it pretty well and I was sort of a Scot in the atlas on this trip.

184
00:28:56,92 --> 00:29:04,44
So the first place we went to were general. And I knew the mayor had met the mayor of China where you see.

185
00:29:04,52 --> 00:29:11,43
So it was nice. He took us into the dock and told us what they were doing and then he said.

186
00:29:12,81 --> 00:29:24,52
The North was always known to be the late as you know initially at that time and for many years after he took us.

187
00:29:25,23 --> 00:29:31,02
And then he said at the end of the day after giving us a while under full meal of spaghetti bowl

188
00:29:31,02 --> 00:29:37,17
and he says would you like to come to a Marxist class tonight and we will suggest we'll have to.

189
00:29:38,66 --> 00:29:50,19
I'll send you an interpreter. And she will bring you. So the interpreter and her name was franca. A medical student.

190
00:29:50,21 --> 00:30:01,03
Who carried her to and from university. So that the letter would know where. And her English was perfect.

191
00:30:01,26 --> 00:30:06,52
So we had Franco who took us to the Marxist class

192
00:30:07,76 --> 00:30:13,17
and I have wondered what it would be like it was you know huge hole they were hanging from the rafters

193
00:30:14,34 --> 00:30:27,09
and that it's just. Loaded Frank has sat next to be madly interpretating get it to print. And I thought. This is life.

194
00:30:27,38 --> 00:30:32,91
Thank God hope for the future late throw my happen out of.

195
00:30:33,69 --> 00:30:40,67
And here with the telly and partisans back in their marxist classes again.
