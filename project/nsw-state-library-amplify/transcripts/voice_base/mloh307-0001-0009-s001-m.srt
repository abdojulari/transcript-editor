1
00:00:15,74 --> 00:00:19,92
Identification.

2
00:00:21,27 --> 00:00:25,47
Station nine recorded with faith and love and care

3
00:00:25,47 --> 00:00:35,53
and cry on Tuesday the fifth of August one thousand nine hundred seven and identification. Identification.

4
00:00:35,75 --> 00:00:37,97
This is Station. Eight.

5
00:00:39,64 --> 00:00:41,28
Karen Craig speaking to faith based band

6
00:00:41,28 --> 00:00:51,3
and it's recorded on Tuesday the fifth of August one thousand nine hundred seventy tape coming up.

7
00:00:51,32 --> 00:01:05,79
So we went back to Germany. And I made for we left and I didn't know that he concentration care.

8
00:01:07,44 --> 00:01:16,26
That was when the Germans went into you know. And persecuted the Jews.

9
00:01:16,28 --> 00:01:33,68
And I just want to linger on that because that persecution of the very nice. People. Was so degrading to their.

10
00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:45,78
To kneel on the streets scrap the streets. When the Nazis went to the university to throw the Jews out of the window.

11
00:01:48,36 --> 00:01:54,84
And that's when Hunt's was arrested and put into trying to duck. Now.

12
00:01:57,52 --> 00:02:05,31
So you see now I had met and it was at a time when a Shiite he was not speaking about that terrible period

13
00:02:06,36 --> 00:02:09,41
but it came to me through another Viennese person.

14
00:02:09,63 --> 00:02:15,36
Lily will use that hunting pain in the dark how concentration camp the name of the concentration.

15
00:02:15,74 --> 00:02:19,27
Came to mean to me that.

16
00:02:21,05 --> 00:02:36,74
We were more familiar with the big names of the big Europe black belts and so on but so too much.

17
00:02:38,8 --> 00:02:44,82
Trying to think of the city which was I mean I think it was I have to check this on the get close.

18
00:02:44,94 --> 00:02:53,61
I think it was in Mannheim own unique one of the other which wasn't so far from the dock.

19
00:02:55,23 --> 00:03:02,77
And it's strange that when we hear that you automatically think of a concentration camp.

20
00:03:03,26 --> 00:03:10,96
We tend to forget that it was a town where ordinary people like us lived and.

21
00:03:10,98 --> 00:03:15,09
That these ordinary people close their eyes to what was going on.

22
00:03:15,47 --> 00:03:30,92
In the big it was one of the biggest camps in fact in Europe. And so we got in the car and we drove to.

23
00:03:31,76 --> 00:03:42,93
Do small and cold. And there was still.

24
00:03:42,95 --> 00:03:51,26
And also the way because towards the end of the war they were burning the party where guns were traveling to the

25
00:03:51,26 --> 00:03:58,58
concentration camps for those killed because they couldn't cope with the date and that you

26
00:03:59,97 --> 00:04:12,59
and anyone you know just said they'd been the way. And the way. And there was also the hanging tree.

27
00:04:12,61 --> 00:04:24,9
The train with people. Punishment and this place. Had been converted into a misplaced persons camp.

28
00:04:24,92 --> 00:04:35,32
And so missed placed people from Eastern Europe and many of whom prefer to go and live in these camps and to be true.

29
00:04:36,35 --> 00:04:48,18
And so we went. Where the people were living. There was no heating of any of the lighting.

30
00:04:49,24 --> 00:05:01,13
People were making time a little far. Clicked around the place. And we spoke to a woman who was from.

31
00:05:01,15 --> 00:05:11,91
Poland and she was with three children living in. And she.

32
00:05:11,92 --> 00:05:18,1
But we have nothing virtually nothing and the people who were in these camps.

33
00:05:19,51 --> 00:05:33,53
It was that they couldn't suffer any more. And the fact that thousands have just been living just a few years ago.

34
00:05:34,12 --> 00:05:40,15
Before they. Didn't have any effect. Because they were too.

35
00:05:40,81 --> 00:05:53,5
They had to be fully occupied with looking after their own life there. And that was a battle.

36
00:05:53,52 --> 00:06:07,71
Well the Americans and the British. At that time and America.

37
00:06:09,8 --> 00:06:15,61
Still grateful that the American Western Germany because they gained.

38
00:06:15,74 --> 00:06:28,01
Food and they treated the Germans badly enough that we could muster any sympathy at that time but.

39
00:06:30,62 --> 00:06:44,23
Throw them stuff truckloads a few luxuries. And on the way back from that day. I felt.

40
00:06:48,3 --> 00:07:02,28
The bodies of all those thousands. Terrible.

41
00:07:03,76 --> 00:07:13,07
And driving on and it was a vast cabbage patch because the Germans if they grew nothing.

42
00:07:13,91 --> 00:07:27,21
And the Americans were training. In one of the fields just. Tanks so it couldn't. And sure it had very much to do.

43
00:07:27,29 --> 00:07:32,14
With their anger against the Germans. They didn't want to be there.

44
00:07:33,41 --> 00:07:36,91
And they would never be you know the Germans in the.

45
00:07:38,95 --> 00:07:41,86
You know I could understand the attitude of the Americans

46
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:51,98
and I could also understand the attitude of the Germans because they wanted to rebuild no doubt.

47
00:07:51,99 --> 00:07:58,3
But these people who considered themselves the most superior of all human.

48
00:07:59,29 --> 00:08:09,44
Was ground under the heels of foreigners and like one man who said we are paying a price for something.

49
00:08:10,75 --> 00:08:32,79
We didn't contribute to the bat. I knew. That. The Germans knew all about the concentration camps.

50
00:08:32,81 --> 00:08:45,79
And it was easier to go to Hitler. Than to. So now. And I thought.

51
00:08:45,81 --> 00:08:58,8
These bastards have given us to world almost And this last war has taken. Fifty thousand Australian. Anyhow.

52
00:08:58,93 --> 00:09:08,13
That was that it was a time of bitterness. It was not a time of reconciliation and I can tell you.

53
00:09:08,15 --> 00:09:25,88
I thought our plan at least. We stayed in Paris for a while and I told you about it and so then we sort of put the.

54
00:09:26,83 --> 00:09:36,1
Ferry and go back to London.

55
00:09:36,12 --> 00:09:40,8
So we put the car on the ferry back to London

56
00:09:41,53 --> 00:09:47,33
and I have to say that going back to London boys you know where I like going home.

57
00:09:47,95 --> 00:09:57,78
I've been away for so long and not thinking some languages. I had a fair bit of.

58
00:09:57,8 --> 00:09:59,79
And then I'd picked up a bit of detail.

59
00:10:00,48 --> 00:10:11,52
But what I mean is it was nice to go to a place where I could communicate with anyone at all or went back to London.

60
00:10:12,16 --> 00:10:15,34
And I had some.

61
00:10:15,74 --> 00:10:22,29
I had more money than most of the delegates I mean they're just great to get the votes no doubt about that

62
00:10:23,17 --> 00:10:33,07
and I had enough money to stay in a very comfortable hotel. In Bloomsbury. Have are told you this.

63
00:10:34,27 --> 00:10:39,06
You mentioned this in the last tape because you were helping other people who had any money.

64
00:10:39,24 --> 00:10:49,5
Yes and I was lending money to these delegates you know but those days London had the law and restaurants.

65
00:10:52,74 --> 00:10:54,00
Did you grew up in London.

66
00:10:55,41 --> 00:11:02,8
I remember them from my very as a very little girl you did you Will you could carry my first.

67
00:11:02,82 --> 00:11:13,51
Well London was one of the cheapest places to live in. That's not to say that the cities in Europe. Italy was dirty.

68
00:11:13,83 --> 00:11:21,09
That. But a so you know we'd all meet up in the Lions where you could get.

69
00:11:22,76 --> 00:11:31,68
The worst food on earth but there was plenty of it and it was cheap half dreadful and it was dangerous.

70
00:11:32,09 --> 00:11:39,3
I think I mentioned it. Was unsafe to stand still in the streets of London because a coup would immediately for you.

71
00:11:40,19 --> 00:11:50,77
But I was able to go to some concerts. And the cold had not started yet. And there was.

72
00:11:51,83 --> 00:11:56,07
I'm not sure if this is correct but it was the friendships.

73
00:11:56,79 --> 00:12:08,43
Of England and the Soviet Union and Festival Hall had just been completed and. They brought a surprise.

74
00:12:09,84 --> 00:12:17,71
From what forces Soviet Union and that was the first concert are going to land. I was very impressed.

75
00:12:19,48 --> 00:12:28,17
Because people there were far more relaxed with people who came from the Eastern European bloc than we were here in

76
00:12:28,17 --> 00:12:50,5
Australia. And I think we turned off. At this point to come back and I came back. Which was a very big.

77
00:12:53,74 --> 00:13:03,23
It had no comfort that I went over on. But when I arrived and came into Sydney.

78
00:13:04,7 --> 00:13:11,09
I had a couple of to die in a night in Melbourne and then we settled up to Sydney came in through the Hades.

79
00:13:11,37 --> 00:13:20,86
And I had given to me when I was in Sofia. About twelve records which I'd packed and brought all away.

80
00:13:21,9 --> 00:13:32,64
I had no idea what I was. And I were. The speeches of Stalin not to be surprised that in the first place.

81
00:13:32,65 --> 00:13:45,49
I was already a figure to watch. So first of all coming into Fremantle.

82
00:13:45,51 --> 00:13:57,59
We had to prove to be a stand and when my mom planned up. The security sitting at the table.

83
00:13:57,61 --> 00:14:09,2
Through an old stamp through. So we were all virtually with. A passport all passports were confiscated.

84
00:14:09,21 --> 00:14:19,3
Was this over to like you know delicate escaped but not all that but it. Others who got the same treatment. And so.

85
00:14:19,34 --> 00:14:26,42
Incidentally for ten years without a passport so were the others. And that was the very.

86
00:14:26,44 --> 00:14:37,34
It was it was the cold war had started to see for Australia. Before England why things were more relaxed in England.

87
00:14:39,04 --> 00:14:52,19
People welcomed others who came in from the Eastern Bloc. But not so not. And we Americans and the Americans.

88
00:14:52,72 --> 00:14:58,12
Ahead on American Committee when people like Howard.

89
00:15:00,17 --> 00:15:07,68
Bell for a huge ropes were all called up Milan were all called aft before the American Committee

90
00:15:08,44 --> 00:15:17,18
and many were deported. Many were deported. Anyhow my passport was taken from me and I came in.

91
00:15:20,01 --> 00:15:29,91
And they were the security cops on the office where customs were going through my suitcase

92
00:15:29,91 --> 00:15:41,88
and I confiscated all is records. Starlin speeches in Russian. I didn't even know what was on the records.

93
00:15:41,9 --> 00:15:49,49
There were also a couple of pool rooms they were taken to the bigger ones he was a red aspirant they were concerned.

94
00:15:49,51 --> 00:15:58,79
And all the beautiful books that I had given to me for instance a very beautiful one given to me have certain graphs of

95
00:15:58,79 --> 00:16:07,41
interest and after a few of these things and I thought well how my going to get them back.

96
00:16:09,89 --> 00:16:15,6
I became very involved in the peace movement and then finally I.

97
00:16:15,74 --> 00:16:25,14
I had a note from security telling me if I wanted I could go pick up those things at number forty Market Street was the

98
00:16:25,14 --> 00:16:35,05
Communist Party headquarters. So there were always.

99
00:16:36,05 --> 00:16:46,38
There were a couple of people whom I knew in the peace movement who spoke Russian. And I think that was Betty block.

100
00:16:46,82 --> 00:16:52,7
And Peter block but I'm quite sure they certainly spoke Polish spoken a bit of Russian

101
00:16:53,4 --> 00:17:03,76
and Jack Black who had a lot of Russian so I said Would you like to face it must have been a terribly a terrible shock

102
00:17:03,76 --> 00:17:09,36
and a rude awakening after this extraordinary nine months that you've had to come back to Australia must have felt like

103
00:17:09,36 --> 00:17:13,42
he was going backwards or something when he came back he says quote right.

104
00:17:13,61 --> 00:17:24,1
I felt I was going into an extremely backward country because before I went to Bama Communist Party was introduced into

105
00:17:24,1 --> 00:17:30,59
Parliament and the Campaign to Prevent the banning of the party.

106
00:17:31,56 --> 00:17:34,53
I had started and it was taken before the High Court eventually

107
00:17:35,3 --> 00:17:45,62
but it was in the leadership against this lack of what was taking away the rights of the citizens

108
00:17:46,64 --> 00:17:57,16
and of course as much written about his particular role in that great campaign and it was when I was in.

109
00:17:57,18 --> 00:18:05,56
In the month of September or October Adventists and Vienna several times on the trip passing through lack

110
00:18:05,56 --> 00:18:09,8
and that we were waiting for the results to come through.

111
00:18:09,94 --> 00:18:15,39
And finally they came through and said the referendum was lost.

112
00:18:17,25 --> 00:18:23,54
And although the referendum was lost didn't make any difference if you were involved in the peace movement we were

113
00:18:23,54 --> 00:18:32,00
going to have peace with anybody that was yet to just have peace with the Queen and all their followers you know.

114
00:18:32,01 --> 00:18:34,33
I tell you it was a terrible time.

115
00:18:34,86 --> 00:18:46,13
And too little is written about the Cold War in Australia far too little people lost their jobs.

116
00:18:46,22 --> 00:18:58,32
Scientists had to get out of the country. And transponder jobs overseas in Britain.

117
00:18:58,34 --> 00:19:05,19
All kinds of people were losing their jobs more so. Among the professions within the profession.

118
00:19:05,21 --> 00:19:11,88
I mean seizing many had to go and work on the wharf so they could pick up a job.

119
00:19:11,9 --> 00:19:19,16
So too little has been written about that terrible. And I'm reminded of it very much.

120
00:19:19,31 --> 00:19:31,48
Now since the Howard Government came to power. Very much. Mainly because of the rise for instance of the. Group.

121
00:19:31,7 --> 00:19:41,38
And Howard Latins to put it. Said to me a lot of many things that brought back.

122
00:19:41,39 --> 00:19:50,84
The situation in pre-war Germany and our saw that. Here recently. Could easily happen.

123
00:19:51,53 --> 00:20:02,00
And someone said to me or face aren't you being extreme and I don't think being extreme at all. Could have just moved.

124
00:20:02,02 --> 00:20:15,62
Before I went away I left working for David. Making the tresses. The.

125
00:20:15,74 --> 00:20:22,86
And the foreman said Well I hope you have wonderful time come back we'll see you in so many months.

126
00:20:22,88 --> 00:20:36,42
So when I came back I went up from and he said I'm sorry faith but. I'm not permitted to employ you. What did you do.

127
00:20:37,95 --> 00:20:46,79
And so I got it. In and I have a place. William Street. I think it was a forgotten.

128
00:20:47,44 --> 00:20:55,2
I've got to really brush my memory happen that. But then I came back and got very involved in the peace movement.

129
00:20:55,22 --> 00:21:01,28
And the peace movement was something that if you didn't have got to didn't get involved in it because you could lose

130
00:21:01,28 --> 00:21:09,13
your job. But the terror of strength within that movement was the street.

131
00:21:10,58 --> 00:21:17,88
And she couldn't care less what people said about her didn't worry.

132
00:21:18,81 --> 00:21:25,02
She'd if she believed in something she went to and nothing would stop it

133
00:21:25,02 --> 00:21:38,66
and she believed we had to build a strong movement to break the barriers that divided between the Eastern European

134
00:21:38,66 --> 00:21:47,82
people and the West. When did you first meet Jesse ST Was it after you came back you know I met her before I went away.

135
00:21:47,84 --> 00:21:59,11
Because I remember seeing her when I was in London. I met her in one hundred forty nine in Melbourne.

136
00:21:59,13 --> 00:22:07,87
Can you describe your first impression. Well I did of her for you. Of course.

137
00:22:07,89 --> 00:22:15,65
And during the you know I shouldn't say I made her. I actually made her. During her came.

138
00:22:15,74 --> 00:22:25,6
Pain to stand for a federal seat the seat of what was known as what I think of all clues

139
00:22:25,6 --> 00:22:28,25
and what it took very very early in.

140
00:22:28,61 --> 00:22:39,35
And she almost Guardian as an independent and I can recall either I will leave all the most.

141
00:22:39,37 --> 00:22:49,71
That I can check that are helping to letterbox out in that area for her. And then I made.

142
00:22:51,3 --> 00:22:58,44
When she founded together with other women the United Association of Women and she said I should go in

143
00:22:58,44 --> 00:23:09,44
and you know that I should be around with progressive women and. These women were no ordinary people.

144
00:23:10,13 --> 00:23:17,2
They were all middle class upper middle class came to the meetings wrapped in full. And pearls.

145
00:23:17,41 --> 00:23:27,74
But they knew what feminism was about. And what their rights workers women and they said they are. And they surrounded.

146
00:23:29,3 --> 00:23:31,02
And supported.

147
00:23:32,11 --> 00:23:38,8
And I knew about this and if I wasn't actually going to one of their meetings at some time or other I just knew.

148
00:23:39,43 --> 00:23:46,46
But I became very much closer to. When the Dean of Canterbury visited Australia or in forty.

149
00:23:47,11 --> 00:23:51,25
For the international moment convention on pace.

150
00:23:52,4 --> 00:24:03,18
And Hugh that that convention would never have had the representation had it not been for J.C.

151
00:24:03,18 --> 00:24:10,98
She had these contacts and like it was like I do said Xander having having lunch.

152
00:24:11,00 --> 00:24:34,28
We start talking about this measure of peace and war and. And she'd say. Now look. I said to naru. Or told me.

153
00:24:34,3 --> 00:24:49,43
That it is really. Just wonderful. She more than any other person on this on this earth influenced my life.

154
00:24:50,71 --> 00:25:03,01
And she said to me one. I'll tell you what face. If one puts their mind to what they want. Well get it.

155
00:25:05,11 --> 00:25:13,34
And she was thinking of preventing another world war and more of feeding hungry people.

156
00:25:13,35 --> 00:25:28,21
And more doing things the best women's rights. So I but I better come back when you came back.

157
00:25:28,42 --> 00:25:29,37
Yes

158
00:25:29,37 --> 00:25:35,52
when you came back she must have been very fascinated about how she was overseas it was already overseas because

159
00:25:35,52 --> 00:25:47,13
when I was in London I was seeing. And she was coming and going to Europe. But when I came back.

160
00:25:50,19 --> 00:25:54,79
I was to be what was no carnival for peace.

161
00:25:54,85 --> 00:26:03,61
I think kind of off piece of just forgotten what that title was but it was being organized by left wing.

162
00:26:03,63 --> 00:26:13,38
And the Communist Party and I couldn't get a place in Sydney to hold it. And that was overseas delegations coming.

163
00:26:15,11 --> 00:26:25,5
And those. It's great embarrassment because nobody no council would permit this festival to be held in the area.

164
00:26:28,26 --> 00:26:39,32
I mean believable. There was only one who the peace movement could raid in the whole of Sydney and that was St.

165
00:26:41,54 --> 00:26:48,54
And there was a Church same Thomases church in North Sydney. That permitted meetings to be held.

166
00:26:50,97 --> 00:26:57,25
And I think another Unitarian Church in Sydney had a little. But you couldn't.

167
00:26:57,27 --> 00:27:03,81
Like the town or anything like that heard of anybody involved in the peace movement

168
00:27:04,77 --> 00:27:10,85
and mediately suspected of being a member of the Communist Party. Yes absolutely.

169
00:27:11,59 --> 00:27:15,13
You didn't have to have a card to Brendan.

170
00:27:15,15 --> 00:27:24,38
And we were told all of those raids working in the movement should be driven underground. Driven out of the country.

171
00:27:25,81 --> 00:27:33,03
No well. Others were involved in the peace movement because the devastation in Europe.

172
00:27:33,92 --> 00:27:39,78
I couldn't bloody well what happened to me and I was determined to go out

173
00:27:39,78 --> 00:27:47,79
and regrettably I didn't have we didn't have video of course no television but I did my best to describe.

174
00:27:48,33 --> 00:27:59,67
What I was sore into Europe the devastation of the great city. But when I arrived back Iraq.

175
00:27:59,73 --> 00:28:05,07
Back when Sydney was preparing for this carnival.

176
00:28:06,08 --> 00:28:14,57
And I think I came back in the month of the end of January and the carnival was to be fifty fifty two. Yes.

177
00:28:15,74 --> 00:28:25,21
And the only council that would permit the festival to get it in was failed so everyone had to get out of city

178
00:28:25,21 --> 00:28:31,52
and go all the way to face field to hold the carnival unbelievable. Truly it was dreadful.

179
00:28:31,89 --> 00:28:36,33
And we got there because they had.

180
00:28:36,35 --> 00:28:41,28
And what what the current of all who was at the carnival

181
00:28:41,28 --> 00:28:45,18
and what happened you know it's all kind of all had people from different countries.

182
00:28:47,13 --> 00:28:54,09
Some people from the Eastern Bloc who were able to get in and a very big contingent from.

183
00:28:55,13 --> 00:29:03,15
New Zealand and of course many people came into state and the book you write it was true.

184
00:29:03,16 --> 00:29:12,05
First of all people brought their dances and and they were. And the artists had a very big movement for peace.

185
00:29:13,13 --> 00:29:22,06
What had I to lose but not only that they were politically conscious. Very much so. And.

186
00:29:22,08 --> 00:29:34,98
I had a great Arctic submission. And it was almost to see some of Australia's leading art artists contributing to the.

187
00:29:34,99 --> 00:29:36,13
Exhibition.

188
00:29:36,52 --> 00:29:44,62
But we couldn't hold that exhibition anywhere because all the places were banned except at the same George Street.

189
00:29:45,07 --> 00:29:54,91
Now with that exception of included people like Nancy bowling and Albert and Roy Del gone S. All those people.

190
00:29:54,93 --> 00:29:59,86
Yes I want to I will say this now. So I make sure that I do that.

191
00:30:00,13 --> 00:30:05,26
I want to go and see Linfox he was involved in organizing the Arctic separation.

192
00:30:05,46 --> 00:30:12,22
So I can remember some of the artists who contributed but they were big shots so once more for me

193
00:30:12,23 --> 00:30:26,42
and we also had people I. This is it was a very important part of my life that cold or. Did some terrible things to.

194
00:30:26,89 --> 00:30:33,57
So many people. And I want to remember it.
