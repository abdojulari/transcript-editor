1
00:00:14,19 --> 00:00:14,98
Identification.

2
00:00:15,15 --> 00:00:18,48
This is station twelve with faith bend

3
00:00:18,48 --> 00:00:24,79
and Karen Craig recorded on Friday sixteenth of August one thousand nine hundred seven tape begins in a few seconds.

4
00:00:25,22 --> 00:00:29,3
And if identification.

5
00:00:29,32 --> 00:00:38,88
If you're going to talk about Tran be shortly after the family should push forward we're holding a meeting rooms of the

6
00:00:38,88 --> 00:00:49,5
fellowship of Australian writers. Which were in Clarence street. Fascinating. Portraits of.

7
00:00:50,11 --> 00:01:03,22
A couple of famous writers like looked at him. I think it was the other a photograph or. I'm not quite sure.

8
00:01:03,24 --> 00:01:18,97
And people of that time. It was a lovely place to me it was very central. And at that meeting your father played.

9
00:01:19,6 --> 00:01:31,44
And he was an Anglican priest very excited about the formation of the fellowship because he really wanted to get away

10
00:01:31,44 --> 00:01:44,32
from charities and you know a very political elf very political. And he wanted to. Get Hawaii from.

11
00:01:44,73 --> 00:01:55,16
What the churches had been doing up to date. Brainwashing children and.

12
00:01:55,17 --> 00:02:01,6
And also could see that was need for an organisation that had Aboriginal people in the leadership and.

13
00:02:03,58 --> 00:02:12,65
So he came in and we met. Now this could have been the beginning of fifty.

14
00:02:14,89 --> 00:02:23,29
And he introduced himself to me and he said we have to get together and I think that's a good idea

15
00:02:23,29 --> 00:02:32,89
but I was rather shy about getting together with the past and I've had enough of a charity. And they ruthless.

16
00:02:34,93 --> 00:02:48,8
People who are concerned. That they did what they believed was the right thing to do at the time and of course.

17
00:02:49,74 --> 00:02:55,51
Picked up whatever social services they could for those children and used. At their own discretion.

18
00:02:56,09 --> 00:03:06,05
And with the color of their money. I was a bit wary about this.

19
00:03:06,07 --> 00:03:14,29
But it belonged to the Anglican Church and where other people who belong to the Anglican Church.

20
00:03:15,03 --> 00:03:25,83
Getting together are not overly interested and well. Shortly after that rang me up and I thought about you know.

21
00:03:26,34 --> 00:03:40,78
He belonged to a Union WU. But he was no priest for that.

22
00:03:43,1 --> 00:03:48,55
He was out at that time to get co-operative for Aboriginal people

23
00:03:48,55 --> 00:04:00,61
and by then he already had one established out in the north Queensland shortly after that I think it was he established

24
00:04:00,61 --> 00:04:09,49
another one which is on the north coast of Yousef wilds. And he saw a car getting into the problem.

25
00:04:09,86 --> 00:04:20,44
That Aboriginal people were confronted with. I think it sounds nice guy. So I said. Well it's like this.

26
00:04:20,48 --> 00:04:26,36
I've got a little and it's difficult for me to get into. Would you like to come to dinner.

27
00:04:27,43 --> 00:04:41,23
And he said yes he would Can I bring up my tiny kitchen. And those days you know. Do you know mainly working.

28
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:52,00
And I think for many many people it would come to work out some political issue.

29
00:04:52,3 --> 00:05:05,29
And that black would have a chop and that would be. If you had to pay to you know you would do well. And why.

30
00:05:05,31 --> 00:05:24,03
But we set a date and. And he brought someone who was the treasurer for the co-op. And he came and he had her back.

31
00:05:24,05 --> 00:05:27,2
Well we couldn't believe it was true.

32
00:05:27,22 --> 00:05:34,21
It was just one more so then and Australians were really you know one hundred at that.

33
00:05:35,4 --> 00:05:44,78
But we got in the little kitchen it chops and drank that one. And then I said Well.

34
00:05:44,8 --> 00:05:56,01
It was possible that there would be a place. To the co-op.

35
00:05:56,02 --> 00:05:59,24
Training College a place for a training college

36
00:06:00,48 --> 00:06:12,94
and then was preparing to follow the launch of the foundations of the college. I shan't go into great detail so.

37
00:06:13,02 --> 00:06:20,16
The beginning of this college train the I will have to check up with one of the founding members who is far more

38
00:06:20,16 --> 00:06:21,83
involved.

39
00:06:21,85 --> 00:06:31,02
But somehow I went along to the founding of Trampy which was held in the whole of the Anglican Church

40
00:06:31,02 --> 00:06:37,66
and the Town Hall is I think the interests. Center interests. So we went along. You know all us heathens.

41
00:06:38,25 --> 00:06:39,97
And said yeah.

42
00:06:40,63 --> 00:06:43,38
All of fellowship executive for there

43
00:06:44,42 --> 00:06:50,7
and I was talking with someone you know from before the meeting actually opened

44
00:06:50,7 --> 00:06:59,26
and our secretary of the Fellowship secretary said Come on fights way fellowship a formal sit together case is a vote

45
00:06:59,26 --> 00:07:07,01
and when all of the same why is this lovely.

46
00:07:07,02 --> 00:07:13,19
When I could remember quite a few passages from a couple of politicians like a politician.

47
00:07:13,21 --> 00:07:23,84
And that was the beginning of Trinity. Now. ELPH was a person who very rigidly opposed.

48
00:07:24,36 --> 00:07:30,05
Anything that put this politically.

49
00:07:30,07 --> 00:07:35,24
And so he wouldn't take a grant from the federal government from the state government.

50
00:07:35,82 --> 00:07:42,7
Well I said to him to get the bloody money from. You bring students into this house.

51
00:07:42,89 --> 00:07:50,19
You've got to feed them make sure they are washed and they were washing is dumb. What kind of thing you did mummy.

52
00:07:50,2 --> 00:07:57,27
He said. We'll get it. We'll get it now I want you to fight to organize it.

53
00:07:57,29 --> 00:08:05,65
And I'll get permission and one how did they only pointer headed.

54
00:08:05,67 --> 00:08:11,93
And I could see that he wanted to get me involved in getting this college. Absolutely absolutely.

55
00:08:13,02 --> 00:08:17,56
But I said I'll tell you what. I'll give you a hand to turn a dinner on.

56
00:08:17,97 --> 00:08:23,27
By invitation and we'll charge people five pounds.

57
00:08:24,8 --> 00:08:29,16
That's a good idea and we'll try and get everything then I hated I said

58
00:08:29,16 --> 00:08:34,94
when you arrived in bases I don't know what would refer.

59
00:08:34,95 --> 00:08:45,89
He went down to fish markets and told them they had to do you see today. And what have you. He went to the.

60
00:08:45,91 --> 00:09:02,92
What was the hotel club and restaurant Union. And said to Harry. They can have to check that. It was a share.

61
00:09:04,02 --> 00:09:20,92
And he said Look fundraiser. Trampy Will you come with me. Of course. Danny hadn't seen the kitchen in this. Kitchen.

62
00:09:20,94 --> 00:09:29,09
And we had to we had to put it back. So that it wouldn't put the gas.

63
00:09:31,04 --> 00:09:42,72
Well we had this and it fell fast always from the union. To Trampy and all his life going. Labor party night.

64
00:09:43,25 --> 00:09:53,44
Well by the time they all coughed up their five pounds each. We made a good cop. And I come to see.

65
00:09:53,46 --> 00:09:57,41
Well day after to recess and what about the fight.

66
00:09:57,58 --> 00:10:05,18
I said Now I'll know why but they forced it didn't turn out that way he hadn't very winning way about him

67
00:10:05,98 --> 00:10:23,15
and I found myself to gather with three fellowship women. Yes Rigby the wife of a parliamentarian state. And myself.

68
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:31,18
They are on the streets trying to sell these old. And I thought.

69
00:10:31,19 --> 00:10:38,07
Look I've got to learn how to say no I'm not for this White. So we made a car.

70
00:10:38,58 --> 00:10:45,85
But when that was all suggested we should have another one and sell it to some of the stalls.

71
00:10:46,6 --> 00:10:47,87
So you got someone to do that.

72
00:10:50,48 --> 00:10:57,97
But I was very involved in tramp he in those first few years very involved in raising funds.

73
00:10:58,58 --> 00:11:08,9
And if he whoever was the manager wanted to die off on Saturday to go to the races or have a fling at Taboo. You know.

74
00:11:08,92 --> 00:11:22,02
I'd go over and cook for the day and look after who were there at the place it was very quite dilapidated thing.

75
00:11:22,91 --> 00:11:24,81
There were some strange happenings.

76
00:11:25,17 --> 00:11:37,4
Like I had very good teachers that and one morning lecture time there was a student missing.

77
00:11:37,69 --> 00:11:45,2
So I went in and I said I happened to be there that day into his office and I said Look.

78
00:11:45,22 --> 00:11:51,6
So it hasn't turned out that he's a boda hero he's a live. STUDENT.

79
00:11:51,74 --> 00:12:01,67
Oh well they're all led out people didn't like to intrude into the bedrooms very quickly.

80
00:12:02,58 --> 00:12:17,25
And they were sent to invade with. The students come from. Where did the Kurdish draw them. Drew them from the island.

81
00:12:18,32 --> 00:12:30,58
It will always include. Chang The last prime minister of PE and she was a student there for a while.

82
00:12:31,5 --> 00:12:45,26
And the priest John my mouse who was I think a member of Parliament for one of the places electorates. Adjourning.

83
00:12:46,4 --> 00:12:57,72
My mouse my mouse I think it is was a student of training base out had these contacts. And we had one today.

84
00:12:58,47 --> 00:13:06,78
Long before there was a Fijian migration to Australia and. They came from the tourist trade.

85
00:13:08,05 --> 00:13:11,2
The two people who came from the tourist trade.

86
00:13:11,22 --> 00:13:17,67
Took very good courses and saw them through one for butchery and the other for bankers.

87
00:13:18,32 --> 00:13:25,84
And he was turned out to be a very good buy. And I came from Queensland.

88
00:13:25,85 --> 00:13:33,34
So the origins of trendy were not really a cultural truly multicultural truly multicultural indeed.

89
00:13:37,2 --> 00:13:43,83
Now I'll just come back to the man who did it because he was such a success.

90
00:13:43,89 --> 00:13:51,64
The waterside workers raised the money to get has been established at Tara Strait Islands.

91
00:13:51,69 --> 00:13:59,92
So you'd like to think it was functioning with that any government sources and

92
00:14:00,8 --> 00:14:07,47
and what else would do you in the afternoon before five o'clock you do the rounds of the pub where all the union

93
00:14:07,47 --> 00:14:12,54
leaders drink. And then you just love to.

94
00:14:13,87 --> 00:14:26,6
And the general secretary telling it to me one face for twenty thousand dollars pounds I think it was.

95
00:14:29,1 --> 00:14:43,04
Give it all to our fellowship. And the right. Morale and unity between the fellowship and trembly.

96
00:14:47,73 --> 00:15:31,04
Not coming back to try and be another. It had a wonderful beginning break. Having a coffee now. Sorry Carol. OK.

97
00:15:33,91 --> 00:15:44,5
Well in the early years of travel. I guess I became quite a big part of it. And. We drew other people.

98
00:15:45,37 --> 00:16:03,63
But in those days. Crates of. And trendy was a place where the matter of what you.

99
00:16:06,76 --> 00:16:16,25
Emerged as a problem or anything else. But you see. Now I remember I was cooking over there.

100
00:16:16,26 --> 00:16:22,31
I told At The Races on the Saturday.

101
00:16:22,32 --> 00:16:34,41
Well I didn't go to the races but he arrived back and he had the Federal Member for Bruce Manfred cross. To see to.

102
00:16:35,12 --> 00:16:47,82
He had a senator. Who was very involved in the rights of people. And.

103
00:16:47,84 --> 00:16:58,98
Who I think he was actually one of the directors of trampy and did we exploited him. And his name was Bill Rigby here.

104
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:12,97
Now. The four of them came in. And the head fit brought beer and stuff. And I can recall.

105
00:17:12,99 --> 00:17:19,67
Potatoes in camp and I got stuck into it. Of all places in the church.

106
00:17:21,19 --> 00:17:27,71
I think I mentioned earlier but you see train we had a chapel and by having the chapel they didn't have to pay right.

107
00:17:27,73 --> 00:17:39,68
Well one of the talks about politics and what have you and it was teeming with rain and the rain was coming in

108
00:17:39,68 --> 00:17:50,46
and I was running around. Dishes to catch the droppings. The place wasn't flooded. They always given me.

109
00:17:51,95 --> 00:17:56,05
Was a great spirit. It was tough. It was.

110
00:17:56,87 --> 00:18:01,39
You know there was never any money if you work for train but you work because you believed it.

111
00:18:03,64 --> 00:18:12,25
And the only person who was paid. I think Secretary who lived here. But like the other.

112
00:18:13,02 --> 00:18:25,22
The money raised from the union. And that my family went for the teachers. It was a place of great gathering.

113
00:18:25,23 --> 00:18:36,29
You could always rely on a great welcome overseas. Trampy Trampy would welcome people who have.

114
00:18:36,31 --> 00:19:01,19
Elf was a great leader for people. One couldn't help but harden our spirit. Because he was out. He was totally without.

115
00:19:01,21 --> 00:19:13,35
He believed that we should work together for the good of the people. Our place became a bit of a gathering place.

116
00:19:13,37 --> 00:19:33,75
And I want to true in the fight. We had a way to have one roof. We had done my. Co-op. What to call it.

117
00:19:34,28 --> 00:19:46,45
Anyhow he was very dedicated to the rights of the rich and you went to jail went to jail with.

118
00:19:48,52 --> 00:19:56,82
Dollars over here for a big meeting we're having in that little room we had that was from the waist.

119
00:19:56,84 --> 00:20:09,95
The street from the world. And I am through probably from Sydney University who was. And with comparison. Of.

120
00:20:13,02 --> 00:20:42,55
I lay that out. And now. Harold come up from. Oh yes. Now what. The author and poet. Who wrote Quincy and.

121
00:20:42,57 --> 00:20:43,6
Dorothy Hewett

122
00:20:44,32 --> 00:20:53,42
and Dorothy had come mainly because of dogs because Dorothy was very involved in that great struggle for a decent way

123
00:20:53,42 --> 00:21:05,17
of the pastoral work. That was. And it was the stranger's assembly of people.

124
00:21:05,19 --> 00:21:12,78
And then it was all said Diagne he was a Christian church pastor. And he'd come up from Mount.

125
00:21:13,22 --> 00:21:31,34
But he didn't want to sit in the same room as the street because he said she was a communist what. Quick smart.

126
00:21:34,27 --> 00:21:41,22
Trade we had a great collection of people from different walks of life

127
00:21:42,1 --> 00:21:52,1
and most people who were there were there because of. Where we built our house the trenches.

128
00:21:52,12 --> 00:22:01,14
There were people like Jesse and of who shed crocodile tears because it was too inconvenient to get up different.

129
00:22:01,16 --> 00:22:06,99
Like it was just happens from the city on her tray and your room in our flat

130
00:22:08,03 --> 00:22:14,65
and many a thing was cooked up in that flat I can tell you many things. And when. French's forest.

131
00:22:15,52 --> 00:22:22,36
They weren't overly happy about that but it didn't take long to find someone who became a regular show for

132
00:22:22,36 --> 00:22:27,77
and this was a bloke who had to look at tests and they are not the only way to this.

133
00:22:28,3 --> 00:22:37,39
And it was why I'm wonderful cheeses. So I offered often get this. To drive him first to the shop.

134
00:22:38,82 --> 00:22:43,7
So it make a few donations like cheese and grog and braid bread

135
00:22:44,51 --> 00:22:52,05
and then he will go on to French's forest around through the spade two and three in the morning

136
00:22:52,05 --> 00:22:59,3
when I'd be throwing these blokes. Would have to go to work. You see.

137
00:22:59,32 --> 00:23:11,13
If you try and be through some extraordinary people. And I'd like to talk about some of the writers. One day.

138
00:23:12,47 --> 00:23:17,44
We had already moved to forest and it may have been around nineteen fifty eight.

139
00:23:17,48 --> 00:23:31,99
I think that my friend rang me up and she said come down. The someone coming here might like you to meet.

140
00:23:32,91 --> 00:23:40,56
And I said All right a high point. And there was a tiny little woman who had an extraordinary.

141
00:23:40,58 --> 00:23:45,2
It was plastered in the place for far and almost like a cross.

142
00:23:46,71 --> 00:23:53,87
Too big for this tiny little figure I thought and she was wearing a red and white striped cotton frock.

143
00:23:54,37 --> 00:24:08,33
Tiny little white you know we all had Carolyn Martin gone by the way. But he how she was and it happened.

144
00:24:09,48 --> 00:24:19,84
And we were sitting down having one of us. Lunch is usually little bits and pieces brought in from the brain.

145
00:24:21,24 --> 00:24:30,88
What have you got. Do you mean you say you know I started telling the stories about my childhood.

146
00:24:33,32 --> 00:24:48,56
Going to school on what it was like during the Depression in a country. And faith you have to write it.

147
00:24:48,58 --> 00:24:55,55
And it was like saying to me this bottle of whiskey polish it off or you know or whatever I could never write.

148
00:24:55,74 --> 00:25:03,88
I thought so I said Oh yes yes she says you have to write it and it was there backing her out.

149
00:25:04,77 --> 00:25:11,6
And she says that wonderful stories for if you really got to put it down. They were wonderful those two women to me.

150
00:25:12,66 --> 00:25:21,71
Then you finished that. And then badgering me and said look I'm such and such a night.

151
00:25:21,72 --> 00:25:36,77
I'm going to visit a friend who lives up on the Hill right. There appealing.

152
00:25:36,79 --> 00:25:47,41
And we had a lot of friends looking up on the very plateau. And I noticed the Ridge Hill because they were all lefty.

153
00:25:47,42 --> 00:26:00,6
You know the way. And they're sure the bra. All living up there and they most of it built their own houses on the tree.

154
00:26:01,85 --> 00:26:20,93
But she was taking me to a man by the name of Joe. And beautiful overlooking. Absolutely beautiful. George still very.

155
00:26:20,95 --> 00:26:28,57
And he produced. Had a beautiful grand piano.

156
00:26:28,89 --> 00:26:38,07
And what had happened to his wife had left him with a child and he was bringing that child up himself.

157
00:26:38,09 --> 00:26:48,01
And when we'd have supper he'd take him to the little boy. And he was very proud to be bringing that child.

158
00:26:48,03 --> 00:26:52,06
So we were sitting at the supper table.

159
00:26:52,08 --> 00:27:02,02
With a lot of hunger and bread and sauerkraut what have you and I was telling you the story.

160
00:27:02,04 --> 00:27:11,11
I think I've always I think I've already mentioned to you about having to do the family which was in primary school.

161
00:27:11,57 --> 00:27:22,21
And the sole of my shoe was coming off of my school shoe. And my mother. That night and back on with.

162
00:27:22,23 --> 00:27:31,57
And very thick straighten and then she put a black shoe polish to the string so that I get could.

00:27:34,11 --> 00:27:50,78
Have turned ON THE STORY. Expensive. Now over the salami and playing in the back.

164
00:27:50,8 --> 00:27:55,7
And I can remember that he the old record he would always play.

165
00:27:56,21 --> 00:28:14,00
In the times I went after that first meeting and they'd Africa very famous. Soprano. He didn't like her.

166
00:28:15,25 --> 00:28:32,66
You know another one but it was to be sung on the water. Float just Absolutely. So. He said to me you must write it.

167
00:28:32,9 --> 00:28:45,15
You faith and when you write it. I'm telling you. Michael that one day you are going to be a great leader.

168
00:28:46,56 --> 00:28:49,21
And you will write books.

169
00:28:49,23 --> 00:28:56,4
But begin by writing those stories and he had a will of you and you know if he said something he wanted one.

170
00:28:56,68 --> 00:29:05,27
To take notes. Didn't mean a thing to me. I used to let those things just go out the window thinking me right.

171
00:29:05,3 --> 00:29:12,8
You know. But I shall always place because she made sure.

172
00:29:12,82 --> 00:29:18,42
That I would have contacts with people who were prepared to listen and give me.

173
00:29:19,00 --> 00:29:30,81
Encouragement and this terrible which I had started. And the writer on a national level.

174
00:29:30,83 --> 00:29:42,58
Decided that they would have a conference here in Sydney. And it was held in a house in Castle Craig. And I said to my.

175
00:29:42,6 --> 00:29:50,08
Look do you think it would help pay for food. Because you're going to going to be fed.

176
00:29:50,19 --> 00:29:57,55
In the house and she said Oh yes said to be wonderful and I can remember making this.

And taking it to this conference of Australia and right there. You know. De Blasio.

Who had just published the book Graham and Coca-Cola my. You must read some of his work. Sometime.

179
00:30:15,57 --> 00:30:22,68
And Stephen Mary Smith who was about to get off the ground.

180
00:30:23,91 --> 00:30:31,96
John Manno for whom I had already made I meet John in nine hundred forty nine in Melbourne.

181
00:30:32,37 --> 00:30:35,00

183
00:30:43,15 --> 00:30:45,18
and died before his time.

184
00:30:45,74 --> 00:30:54,43
But Hanson I became very close friends with John and Katie never manifolds the early settlers in Victoria.

185
00:30:54,54 --> 00:31:07,4
You might recall how they built the Bluestone castle. They were scores of people but they were Melbourne people.

186
00:31:07,61 --> 00:31:14,01
And he became his uncle. So chased him and became very famous with race horses.

187
00:31:14,48 --> 00:31:24,56
