00:00:13,77 --> 00:00:20,8
Identification. This is session five. Interview with faith.

2
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:30,06
Bandler and Carolyn Craig recorded in Sydney on Friday the twentieth of June one nine hundred ninety seven.

3
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:53,64
The interview begins in approximately ten seconds time and if identification. Faith. When did you come to Sydney.

4
00:00:55,38 --> 00:01:06,75
I came to Sydney in nineteen forty. And the war. Was already long. That Australia was not.

5
00:01:06,77 --> 00:01:25,08
Heavily involved with the war because the Japanese had not yet. The American base. Anyhow. Now I had a fairy godmother.

6
00:01:25,7 --> 00:01:38,54
And her name was Lucy. Lucy came from a very wealthy family in the north okaying growers now Lucy.

7
00:01:38,56 --> 00:01:44,88
I had a family of four all grown up a little older than me. And she needed help.

8
00:01:46,58 --> 00:01:55,15
Because she lived most of the time in Sydney. In a beautiful beautiful magnificent place.

9
00:01:55,64 --> 00:02:08,5
On a cliff to gardens and so we had an agreement. As it were that. I would help in the house and help.

10
00:02:08,51 --> 00:02:15,38
And she would give me certain. It wasn't didn't dream and it just happened.

11
00:02:18,73 --> 00:02:23,96
She absolutely insisted that I go back and do piano which I did.

12
00:02:24,53 --> 00:02:31,97
And she absolutely insisted that I practiced every afternoon. And I did sometimes from twelve in the day.

13
00:02:32,46 --> 00:02:48,6
Right through until seven or eight or whatever at night and. She just. Made me do things to sing.

14
00:02:50,39 --> 00:03:06,04
And she had a sister in law his name was Lady. Again the mother of little. Who was a very good pianist.

15
00:03:06,48 --> 00:03:11,38
She actually lived at the spit and she would come over on a Sunday.

16
00:03:12,77 --> 00:03:26,05
And Mrs Walker would absolutely insist that all my music. And sing. Sister in law put accompany me.

17
00:03:28,85 --> 00:03:34,58
Well for the Japanese and there were other things she didn't like.

18
00:03:34,6 --> 00:03:38,43
And she'd help me fitted dress and all this kind of thing.

19
00:03:39,79 --> 00:03:45,99
She was a woman with an amazing how well most beautiful people I've ever met.

20
00:03:46,36 --> 00:03:50,36
You know where it was sort of a mother for me

21
00:03:50,36 --> 00:03:57,19
and she you see I go out in the morning pick up the Sydney Morning Herald make her a cup of tea put it on her tray

22
00:03:57,19 --> 00:04:06,4
little book. And take it. Upstate. And she loved it just loved it but she was a wonderful person.

23
00:04:06,71 --> 00:04:15,72
It was the second time she'd been through. She'd lost her brothers in the first world. And now.

24
00:04:15,74 --> 00:04:27,07
With one brother a prisoner of war. Prisoner of war in Germany another. In the now. And after series of.

25
00:04:29,43 --> 00:04:36,1
What year was this and that you came to Sydney and we did you. We were you living at this time when you knew her.

26
00:04:37,8 --> 00:04:43,65
I was living in verse. Actually when I first had met her.

27
00:04:43,7 --> 00:04:49,13
But and she was on her Why to Sydney after she was staying in prison for a bit but.

28
00:04:52,62 --> 00:04:58,91
What was your other question it was a good one where you're talking about taking breakfast up to her I was like a way

29
00:04:58,91 --> 00:05:00,51
where we were living at that time.

30
00:05:00,55 --> 00:05:08,8
Oh well you see it was a huge house and our head it was as it were a little apartment of those houses.

31
00:05:09,47 --> 00:05:20,83
And Clifton gardens. Yes and I had my own bathroom and a little lounge through and through an absolutely beautiful.

32
00:05:21,33 --> 00:05:27,96
And the distortions of growth the window encrypted through the right wing's was heavenly.

33
00:05:28,09 --> 00:05:36,15
And I travel to and from of course on the. And that's how it was that I happened to be going.

34
00:05:36,86 --> 00:05:44,58
When the Japanese the not the Japanese submarines came into the. Well now infant or not.

35
00:05:46,81 --> 00:05:52,68
Perhaps I would never have been able to do a lot of the things I have done in my life.

36
00:05:52,8 --> 00:06:03,32
She always looked on me as though I could do anything. It wouldn't matter what it was can do it as it were. And.

37
00:06:03,33 --> 00:06:19,53
She instilled a lot of pride in me and some have made me value. Integrity almost and beautiful.

38
00:06:20,5 --> 00:06:25,58
And so then one day I said Look I really would like to join the land. I mean you do that.

39
00:06:25,84 --> 00:06:28,28
Well I've told you about the land.

40
00:06:28,74 --> 00:06:38,84
But what I would come only she would come to the central why in her little car and me.

41
00:06:38,86 --> 00:06:43,37
I would be there in my brother would come and stay with me or both.

42
00:06:43,47 --> 00:06:52,6
My sister and I would stay there and she could never do. And that's how I felt about her in the car.

43
00:06:52,77 --> 00:07:06,27
So it was I think made me feel that I should develop musically. Although she didn't have a great appreciation for the.

44
00:07:06,63 --> 00:07:16,9
Classics as such but she enjoyed listening listening to good singing and to good music. And already they knew C.

45
00:07:16,9 --> 00:07:19,64
I was already going to the concerts.

46
00:07:21,35 --> 00:07:32,45
I want to talk today about this part of my life when she insisted that I take piano lessons. If I had a teacher.

47
00:07:33,77 --> 00:07:43,51
And she was very good teacher by the name of Margaret Coburn. Who had a house in Jersey.

48
00:07:43,53 --> 00:07:49,01
And she lived there with her parents she had a beautiful big studio.

49
00:07:49,03 --> 00:08:05,77
Beautiful teacher just marvelous I went to a couple of years. She then said well look after their. And I have to go.

50
00:08:08,19 --> 00:08:18,71
And here's my season ticket. You simply. Concerts and used it until I come back and I just came back.

51
00:08:18,73 --> 00:08:26,07
I think she stayed over there because I didn't hear any more about what happened. I began the ticket.

52
00:08:26,09 --> 00:08:40,4
I renewed it for a little while. And you know I was bitten by one truly. So then I took a nap for myself so.

53
00:08:41,86 --> 00:08:47,32
I talked about my views of before and after the war of course I came back to Sydney

54
00:08:48,57 --> 00:08:56,77
and I found the wasn't awfully much to live for after. Getting to those concerts in the town hall.

55
00:08:58,04 --> 00:09:09,95
I wasn't particularly I was twenty six twenty seven maybe and I wasn't particularly interested in me

56
00:09:09,96 --> 00:09:24,04
but they used to chase me like Christmas which I kept you never had a minute's peace. And some awful.

57
00:09:24,06 --> 00:09:33,57
Wouldn't give you tuppence for you. You made hands at a concert didn't you. But that was that was a bit like.

58
00:09:33,58 --> 00:09:42,59
Like when I came home that was the end of ninety and forty five. Came back to Sydney and went back to Mrs Walker.

59
00:09:42,61 --> 00:09:59,25
And it was like just being at home. I want to grow wings. I felt restricted. So within a short time.

60
00:09:59,96 --> 00:10:12,56
I felt conscious of packing a suitcase and going off and I found a room. They're arming Street Kings Cross or a.

61
00:10:12,65 --> 00:10:23,1
That unlike Downing Yes Downing. It was an awful place.

62
00:10:23,38 --> 00:10:30,21
I cannot tell you how awful it was it was one huge and in that there was a gas ring in the corner.

63
00:10:31,38 --> 00:10:37,1
Where you could heat your water. For about half and you would have washed down it wouldn't.

64
00:10:37,11 --> 00:10:45,45
There was no showers in the place. There was nothing virtually just.

65
00:10:46,61 --> 00:10:52,22
So I had a great big tub and the water up on the ring

66
00:10:53,44 --> 00:11:05,17
and my sister shared this with me because it was so big we could share. I think we're paying. And.

67
00:11:08,28 --> 00:11:11,78
And then I thought well I must get back to my music.

68
00:11:12,55 --> 00:11:19,57
Because at this time during the war extensively and I want to keep this.

69
00:11:21,33 --> 00:11:32,93
So I began singing around a cross and they had crossed. And it was held. I think once a month in a local theater.

70
00:11:33,43 --> 00:11:47,43
And you won by acclamation. So they organized. Something Mo He had a fair bit to do with radio and.

71
00:11:47,45 --> 00:11:52,14
He said or didn't you come face and enter.

72
00:11:53,13 --> 00:12:02,47
And I think it was ten pounds was the first prize and it would be held on a Sunday night and all across.

73
00:12:03,83 --> 00:12:08,42
There were better singers and make the work better trained singers than me.

74
00:12:08,43 --> 00:12:14,45
There was no question about it but they didn't value. The quality.

75
00:12:14,47 --> 00:12:23,36
You need movement just good training and I hope that even though I didn't quite know how to use it and.

76
00:12:24,53 --> 00:12:26,01
I went up this night

77
00:12:26,01 --> 00:12:34,99
and I was backed by a few of the blokes like I kind of had a very close friendship they knew the man.

78
00:12:35,01 --> 00:12:45,05
And he's rotten and there was another Blanco's a barrister. They all said Paul come off ice let's get up there.

79
00:12:45,24 --> 00:12:53,43
We'll clack clack. Well I think I have one more because I had no friends in the audience.

80
00:12:53,44 --> 00:13:01,34
That had that on merit because there really was a singer who knew how to use her voice

81
00:13:01,34 --> 00:13:09,18
but her top couldn't reach the top notes that I could try and as I was maybe up the long

82
00:13:09,18 --> 00:13:18,07
or short of this is I wanted to have ten pounds richer. And ten. It was like a thousand today.

83
00:13:19,52 --> 00:13:21,7
Do you remember the name of the feature of the street.

84
00:13:22,82 --> 00:13:31,84
Oh it was right in Darling her strode I remember that was a few doors from where to Mary. Right in the heart.

85
00:13:31,86 --> 00:13:39,04
There was the Arabian coffee shop and it was almost opposite.

86
00:13:39,05 --> 00:13:42,6
And I talk about Iraq even coffee shop as you would know it

87
00:13:42,6 --> 00:13:50,19
but you see before one did anything you know the crafts you had to go to the Arabian coffee shop.

88
00:13:50,41 --> 00:14:00,09
There was upstairs there was a little over and. There. And treated customers like kings and queens.

89
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:11,09
You could sit there all night over one cup of coffee and I wouldn't view it had very much a touch of the old.

90
00:14:12,65 --> 00:14:20,97
Where you didn't go for coffee. You went to meet your might read the newspapers and no one would disturb you.

91
00:14:22,27 --> 00:14:24,13
And that's what the Arabian horse about.

92
00:14:24,33 --> 00:14:28,64
Well I would go up there with this trick of me talking up the steps without me

93
00:14:28,64 --> 00:14:38,18
and we are on the other end of the Arabian and you look down to learning this. And we drink coffee.

94
00:14:38,38 --> 00:14:42,75
They hadn't blue crawfish caps and saucers

95
00:14:42,75 --> 00:14:54,78
and little blue Jack said Hilda Crean did have milk with coffee with coffee and. You didn't D.C.

96
00:14:54,78 --> 00:15:05,84
Just drink this black stuff. Just so happened twelve o'clock would get the hint you know.

97
00:15:05,86 --> 00:15:18,77
I've walked into Downing Street now living in this room in Downing Street was the man who lived in the room below me

98
00:15:19,55 --> 00:15:31,04
had to flow from the ground floor. And he was a great Gilbert and Sullivan.

99
00:15:31,05 --> 00:15:37,24
Funny looking black and what he did for a living but he is just God knows what

100
00:15:38,16 --> 00:15:46,6
and he had a teacher by the name of God He and Italian teacher who lived opposite on the corner of Downing Street

101
00:15:46,6 --> 00:15:53,5
and King's Cross and he and his wife lived on the top floor and he that was his teacher.

102
00:15:53,89 --> 00:16:02,16
And he said to me look at any charges I published and what. I see if you look you know I'm only getting a quid a week.

103
00:16:02,18 --> 00:16:15,94
This is what you. Go every fortnight or so I did and that I went to got he got he was. Impatient to get me on the road.

104
00:16:15,96 --> 00:16:26,92
He he didn't I had to work out my technique. And I had a clue. You know I only ALWAYS AND BEAUTIFUL know.

105
00:16:28,58 --> 00:16:36,28
And I thought well I'll go to guy and he will tell me how to use my much.

106
00:16:36,3 --> 00:16:42,4
My whole body but it didn't work at that way because he was very interested get me. Singing.

107
00:16:43,3 --> 00:16:56,45
Well you know he was a great bloke I thought with personality and. He he had this studio.

108
00:16:56,47 --> 00:17:05,3
With his grand piano and that you walked out onto that overlook.

109
00:17:05,32 --> 00:17:17,14
And he would send me out on to the friend to the house. And he would play much from Tosca he loved the Arias of course.

110
00:17:17,52 --> 00:17:26,66
And he made me. And he says go on to the water. I go to the water now.

111
00:17:26,68 --> 00:17:32,75
I was singing a duet after the sale of part of the.

112
00:17:32,76 --> 00:17:45,71
From task forgotten the title and this bloke who was in the room below me across the room began to sing the tenor Oh.

113
00:17:45,73 --> 00:18:04,75
And across Downing Street. We would do it going. And I rather like this bloke can think about his name.

114
00:18:04,77 --> 00:18:12,17
But you know why he was he protected me and my sister. He kept an eye on us fairly.

115
00:18:13,85 --> 00:18:19,11
Not that I felt I needed protecting but there were awful lot of blokes who used to come and hang around

116
00:18:19,11 --> 00:18:21,3
and you know some would bring me always sisters

117
00:18:21,3 --> 00:18:31,51
and some would bring me you know what marmalade Linfox would bring me his planning. And they'd come at all hours.

118
00:18:31,53 --> 00:18:37,2
And this bloke Antony would keep an eye out. You know if there was a knock on the door.

119
00:18:37,2 --> 00:18:40,89
He'd make sure he'd make sure I was all right.

120
00:18:44,13 --> 00:18:49,25
But there was a scientist from the water boat who made it terrible nuisance of himself

121
00:18:50,29 --> 00:18:55,98
and so my friend the singer Billy. Sit would you like me to speak to you.

122
00:18:56,1 --> 00:19:04,5
I said just a matter of fact and he did it in no uncertain and I was given some peace. Anyhow.

123
00:19:04,52 --> 00:19:08,67
And they began and I rather enjoyed that part of my life.

124
00:19:08,91 --> 00:19:16,32
You know going across the road and singing to the harbor waters and all that and the thing and then the bloke

125
00:19:16,32 --> 00:19:24,35
and I remember Larry said to me. Now he says look he doesn't teach us how to breathe. And if you like.

126
00:19:25,26 --> 00:19:33,36
If you ask your own great. So he did so we would exchange. And I would tell him how to get up. OK.

127
00:19:33,38 --> 00:19:40,86
And where it should be there. Oh there. What have you. Well.

128
00:19:40,88 --> 00:19:46,11
Things changed a bit and what all these men who hunger and I will own

129
00:19:46,11 --> 00:19:54,27
and if not to the communist party they belong to label. And I began to become very political.

130
00:19:54,29 --> 00:20:04,86
And I would join them like New Year's Eve night in the cross was what. Of cross point.

131
00:20:05,73 --> 00:20:18,03
Rush cut is by not put gas in the cross. Normal circumstances. Every Sunday night. You want a citizen of the cross.

132
00:20:18,05 --> 00:20:25,02
If you didn't go out on the street and look for your group. And you'd find on one corner the. Labor.

133
00:20:25,44 --> 00:20:33,23
Right at the corner Labor left another corner of the trust a corner of the communists and so it would go on

134
00:20:33,23 --> 00:20:36,2
and so you'd kind of find your niche.

135
00:20:36,22 --> 00:20:42,36
They wouldn't you know Sunday night and but somehow when you see night would come.

136
00:20:42,74 --> 00:20:51,65
The political differences would be banished and people would just drove but back and greeting each other.

137
00:20:54,12 --> 00:21:06,62
It was just wonderful. And then at midnight. We there. Just the street and the cross had a big place in my.

138
00:21:06,64 --> 00:21:22,25
My whole body. You mentioned a merry Gilmore. I didn't make Dame Mary until a better ninety. Fifty.

139
00:21:22,68 --> 00:21:28,75
And she lived there and one other things I remember saying I can't remember how I first met her

140
00:21:28,75 --> 00:21:30,55
but she invited me up for a cup of tea.

141
00:21:32,08 --> 00:21:35,81
And I sent a little note asking her if I could go on a certain day

142
00:21:35,81 --> 00:21:43,71
and she sent a little note back saying yes of course do come child.

143
00:21:43,73 --> 00:21:56,15
And she had a door it's true on the inside but always remember this. You know.

144
00:21:56,17 --> 00:22:08,9
They say it's not safe to walk our streets meaning they need trouble. She would have been say ninety there.

145
00:22:10,61 --> 00:22:17,97
Had any trouble at all. And I thought that was just beautiful. Yes.

146
00:22:17,98 --> 00:22:24,82
Did you mean I mean it was such a hey me and community in those days and political community did you meet people like.

147
00:22:25,5 --> 00:22:39,24
Douglas Steele and Margaret Cullen and people like that. Well. Douglas Stewart. Cohen. But I did.

148
00:22:39,75 --> 00:22:54,12
Already know they artist. And that. And I met. I think it was my brow lift. In part which was Potts Point you know.

149
00:22:54,43 --> 00:23:08,23
In my play St Di mayor was there. Of course but I suppose the most important people of all who were there.

150
00:23:08,24 --> 00:23:18,68
Paul Williams and his wife Bobbie. And I lived in Tuscan I'm straight. They had a flat they had a one bedroom flat.

151
00:23:18,69 --> 00:23:23,53
And then I had the lounge and a kitchenette you couldn't swing a cat

152
00:23:24,28 --> 00:23:34,39
and prepare me for some food in the kitchen it shall never forget it that when I met Bobby and Paul.

153
00:23:34,65 --> 00:23:40,39
They had only just married. I had already had made Paul's previous wife. Lily.

154
00:23:42,41 --> 00:23:50,7
And Lily just want to talk about Lily for a moment leaves a beautiful woman.

155
00:23:54,93 --> 00:24:06,8
That she was a dedicated member of the Communist Party. She lived. In a pocket units that are very independent.

156
00:24:10,34 --> 00:24:12,48
And she lived and she had the plague.

157
00:24:12,65 --> 00:24:19,1
Because it was very doubt that she realized she was very fortunate because those days you couldn't get a place to live

158
00:24:19,1 --> 00:24:26,97
not for the love of not even for a million dollars There was nothing after just nothing that I had this room

159
00:24:26,97 --> 00:24:30,22
and darling stage I thought I was among one of the most fortunate of all people.

160
00:24:31,53 --> 00:24:41,06
Well lived there and it was a self-contained good in good condition and she had a lot of men friends who were.

161
00:24:41,52 --> 00:24:53,53
Very political extremely political lived for their parties the Labor Party or Conyers Pat. And some kind of adopted me.

162
00:24:53,55 --> 00:25:02,04
It's hard to explain. She wanted me to do great things.

163
00:25:03,72 --> 00:25:15,55
And I just wanted to be bloody lazy and sing around the place and. You know knock about a bit. And she took to be back.

164
00:25:15,57 --> 00:25:24,4
Marx and Engels and I thought I couldn't care less. I couldn't care less so.

165
00:25:25,56 --> 00:25:31,76
Then one day she said to me you know if you should join the party.

166
00:25:31,78 --> 00:25:38,16
And I say for a moment I thought during the party of all her friends.

167
00:25:38,18 --> 00:25:46,75
And I said which party she says there is only one party. There is nothing else.

168
00:25:46,76 --> 00:25:52,74
A lot of the laughter probably ought to be good. This was the Communist Party.

169
00:25:53,01 --> 00:26:02,04
Yes yes that we agreed to be afraid this in spite of the fact that our joining any cause any party after all

170
00:26:02,8 --> 00:26:12,32
and we went to concerts together that was what I enjoy it immensely. And she had to be played in the Christian.

171
00:26:12,65 --> 00:26:20,43
Who would get tickets. For special concerts and what have you and she always took me one.

172
00:26:20,45 --> 00:26:25,8
She had contacts there was no question about it and she knew everyone who played in the local stores

173
00:26:25,8 --> 00:26:32,29
but there's no doubt about that but she was also afraid of being in a good ski.

174
00:26:32,7 --> 00:26:38,4
Now do you know if that one means anything to you Carol. But he was a very he was a spy.

175
00:26:39,74 --> 00:26:51,08
And he became rather prominent during the Petrov commission. And he played the violin in your Christer.

176
00:26:54,26 --> 00:26:57,27
I won't go into details or bad people or go skiing.

177
00:26:57,32 --> 00:27:05,35
Having mentioned its name in the commission if ever I write this up I will certainly in large because it was a very

178
00:27:05,35 --> 00:27:12,85
terrible time it was a dreadful. So if you come back to Paul.

179
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:21,57
Lee made a bloody nuisance of herself because she and Paul had divorced and Paul had married.

180
00:27:21,59 --> 00:27:34,14
Paul fell on his feet hear voices singing teacher marrying this magnificent young just thirty he is here.

181
00:27:36,62 --> 00:27:48,48
And she would accompany all his stars. I mean he couldn't have had a better. But. Tremendous impact on her life.

182
00:27:49,08 --> 00:28:01,14
It was quite unbelievable I look back on it now. That's right. Lily said to me look.

183
00:28:01,16 --> 00:28:06,94
You give that he tell you know why he's not teaching you how to sing that all he's just enjoying you.

184
00:28:07,33 --> 00:28:13,69
You give him away. And you go to a pole. I did precisely that.

185
00:28:14,25 --> 00:28:20,16
And I realized then but they were happy happy times with gaiety the Italian teacher

186
00:28:20,16 --> 00:28:29,83
and I had no regrets it took me nothing. He just made me keep to keep singing high notes and to sink to the water.

187
00:28:29,84 --> 00:28:30,97
Well cannot happen after that.

188
00:28:31,3 --> 00:28:34,34
So I thought it was time to get down to serious business

189
00:28:34,34 --> 00:28:44,23
and at least if you go to poor old school had Lillian Paul immigrated from Europe or they stray and. Born.

190
00:28:44,5 --> 00:28:48,91
They both come out in one thousand nine hundred thirty nine hundred thirty. You know.

191
00:28:49,41 --> 00:28:54,19
After the Nazis walked into the here and both.

192
00:28:55,18 --> 00:29:02,15
Paul had a very interesting life but they couldn't live under the same roof and would also of their own.

193
00:29:02,54 --> 00:29:06,24
So they're divorced out here. They were married when I came out.

194
00:29:07,68 --> 00:29:16,04
Anyhow I found that going to Paul's and obvious place was more than going for a music listener also

195
00:29:17,09 --> 00:29:31,9
but the music lesson was conducted very professional very. And for the first half hour. I would do the scales.

196
00:29:31,92 --> 00:29:42,33
And then he showed me how to develop and develop the. Way to hold the breath and normalize it and.

197
00:29:45,01 --> 00:29:54,15
He was very very particular and nobody in a student of his would he encouraged to sing. Hubert in English.

198
00:29:54,49 --> 00:30:00,63
So I began to take German license from him for some reason or other a new bit of German for that.

199
00:30:01,58 --> 00:30:11,84
And so forth and awfully difficult to. I would go for a German lesson. And that.

200
00:30:12,65 --> 00:30:18,14
I had practically a pair for my rent there was nothing left in that thing.

201
00:30:19,01 --> 00:30:28,08
You know I don't do old clothes and remake them and only kind of think. How were you in your living at that point.

202
00:30:28,1 --> 00:30:31,4
That was when I was infected in a shirt factory.

203
00:30:33,5 --> 00:30:36,87
That day and it wasn't tough

204
00:30:37,6 --> 00:30:45,6
and the person who owned it was a family with whom I had beautiful friendship with his daughters.

205
00:30:47,17 --> 00:30:57,21
And it was a regular money and I was tough and strong. You know me and they paid me well.

206
00:30:57,23 --> 00:31:02,89
And it was enough to make the cost of my music lessons and to pay the rent.

207
00:31:02,91 --> 00:31:11,1
And the blacks would bring me food and this kind of thing. But.
