1
00:00:33,89 --> 00:00:43,96
I did. This is session ten with a spender and Karen and Craig. And we're just about to begin the session.

2
00:00:44,27 --> 00:00:47,82
And if identification.

3
00:00:47,84 --> 00:00:51,82
We ended last session with you talking about your lovely house

4
00:00:51,82 --> 00:01:00,96
and time at French's forest all the years you spent there and maybe you want to start there. All all somewhere else.

5
00:01:02,74 --> 00:01:09,59
I want to go back from the forest house. In actual fact after we moved to French's forest.

6
00:01:10,04 --> 00:01:18,48
It was half a time when accommodation for still so awfully awfully. To get anywhere.

7
00:01:18,49 --> 00:01:26,2
And we had a free the author John Clarke who was very anxious to live to find a place to live in.

8
00:01:27,16 --> 00:01:34,51
So we let her into the flat we had me and told her to pay the Internet.

9
00:01:35,47 --> 00:01:40,12
Well this worked for a while but then let you stay on it anyhow.

10
00:01:40,94 --> 00:01:49,73
Well I wanted to leave the house of the forest and go back to the flattered North Sydney. When I returned from Europe.

11
00:01:49,98 --> 00:02:06,42
This person per woman from. And so me. And she said. Well we've got to get something.

12
00:02:07,2 --> 00:02:11,09
And we don't for any of those churches you know who are really those trade unions

13
00:02:11,09 --> 00:02:21,65
or Liberal party communist party party we've got to keep them all out. But it will be a fellowship of black and white.

14
00:02:22,73 --> 00:02:26,48
Well. Nothing in actual fact. And.

15
00:02:26,49 --> 00:02:37,48
For two years because Pearl vanished again and went back to the bush and I was involved in many other things

16
00:02:40,72 --> 00:02:50,19
when she appeared. And she called at seven o'clock one morning. And wondered what ever had happened.

17
00:02:50,25 --> 00:02:55,85
I mean you just didn't go visiting people in Riyadh heard seven o'clock in the morning.

18
00:02:57,3 --> 00:02:59,39
But here in Pillow hit it off beautifully

19
00:02:59,39 --> 00:03:04,46
and she said with him in a little kitchen it while he had these conflicts before he went off to work

20
00:03:04,46 --> 00:03:12,67
and then she said to me put the building on. And we said Hey just some tea and she said we've got to.

21
00:03:12,69 --> 00:03:22,25
And this is how I wanted to play and one of the goals of the organization would be to abolish the Aboriginal welfare.

22
00:03:23,07 --> 00:03:31,35
Now she was in fact a member of that board and if it were anyone else black or white they would want to continue.

23
00:03:31,37 --> 00:03:38,56
But she was a woman who thought a better. Other people.

24
00:03:38,57 --> 00:03:42,92
So I said well you know I was awfully reluctant to tell you the truth.

25
00:03:43,14 --> 00:03:51,62
I couldn't see why I would have to be involved in the rights of anyone else other than the rights of all Australians

26
00:03:51,62 --> 00:03:54,74
all the people of the world and it was at a time

27
00:03:54,74 --> 00:03:59,47
when the African Americans were having a great struggle for their rights

28
00:04:00,48 --> 00:04:07,56
and the people in the African states were fighting for independence and I sort of felt well you know around the world.

29
00:04:07,75 --> 00:04:12,73
Why should I get involved in a local thing. It's the people of the world who need their rights.

30
00:04:12,75 --> 00:04:13,93
Well who is Arcade ing

31
00:04:15,04 --> 00:04:28,3
and he said I was being told that I could play a part on the international stage for human rights. Well you know.

32
00:04:28,31 --> 00:04:41,57
Little me so. Pearl was very very persistent. And she came. That morning and she went away.

33
00:04:42,19 --> 00:04:47,9
And I didn't even think about it then she came a few mornings later to settle the tea

34
00:04:47,9 --> 00:04:57,08
and in the meantime she'd had some words with the street and a woman by the name of Rosie in good. A remarkable woman.

35
00:04:57,39 --> 00:05:02,58
One of the very early female graduate graduates of Sydney University

36
00:05:04,24 --> 00:05:09,43
and I think she graduated in May have been social work

37
00:05:09,43 --> 00:05:15,23
but I have an idea it had to do with literature I'm not quite sure about that but anyhow.

38
00:05:17,63 --> 00:05:24,93
We think it's time that a good organisation should be formed it was given a lot of encouragement from these two women

39
00:05:25,78 --> 00:05:33,84
and they'd she came back to me and it was Jessie who said to her you must get Fife you simply must get by

40
00:05:35,33 --> 00:05:37,25
and pokÃ©mon told me this.

41
00:05:37,94 --> 00:05:46,94
Now I had two very very good friends which I think I've mentioned earlier or perhaps I haven't by the name of March.

42
00:05:49,06 --> 00:05:54,94
Both poets Muir of considerable size as the poet

43
00:05:56,25 --> 00:06:02,98
and they were very good to me that helped me in fact with accommodation at one stage

44
00:06:06,02 --> 00:06:15,48
and I talked to who was a public servant. I had in his capacity.

45
00:06:15,5 --> 00:06:25,49
In the capacity of his work had to visit country towns from time to time. And he became very concerned about the.

46
00:06:25,56 --> 00:06:33,05
Situation of the people because what he observed now.

47
00:06:35,19 --> 00:06:41,69
I talked to me you are about things that poor Pearl had been suggesting to me.

48
00:06:42,7 --> 00:06:51,18
And he was so enthusiastic just stick he came from quite a comfortable background.

49
00:06:51,58 --> 00:07:00,08
He was a political person he thought about things that were political that he was also a gentle loving

50
00:07:01,58 --> 00:07:11,18
and compassionate person beautiful powered anyhow that he will live in that boat house incurably in Kerry bill of St

51
00:07:11,18 --> 00:07:16,23
Kira Billy and it was a huge house great old rambling house

52
00:07:17,23 --> 00:07:26,11
and I said Miller said Our place is available if you want to have a meeting and I just told him I had been pushed back.

53
00:07:26,13 --> 00:07:36,85
And said the meeting was cool in house. And I just ask was that managed by SEE THE POET. Marge price or the poet.

54
00:07:36,87 --> 00:07:49,00
Yes that's right. And she used her maiden name parser after. He died at the age of thirty.

55
00:07:49,86 --> 00:07:53,64
But we got down there into this lovely old house

56
00:07:54,34 --> 00:08:04,71
and I always recall the first meeting was right in one of her books the book.

57
00:08:04,73 --> 00:08:14,00
And she had Helen Thomas they were in the kitchen because Helen was checking the proofs with Madge.

58
00:08:14,14 --> 00:08:33,9
But the rest of us got into the arms through and at that meeting the pearl. My sister massing. Grace badly.

59
00:08:36,23 --> 00:08:50,66
Rose in Ghouta MN and her sister a person an architect by the name of John Walker.

60
00:08:50,68 --> 00:08:55,98
And I think that was it that may have been a couple more. I think about that later.

61
00:08:57,54 --> 00:09:05,32
And so I have the minutes of that meeting in Mirror's handwriting.

62
00:09:06,29 --> 00:09:12,36
I had a copy made recently to a court and I thought it likely. Anyhow.

63
00:09:12,38 --> 00:09:25,18
The meeting got on to what he and it was agreed that we would form an organization and to work for the limitation of.

64
00:09:26,43 --> 00:09:32,23
Legislation that discriminated against the Aboriginal people of New South Wales.

65
00:09:34,11 --> 00:09:43,56
Always remember saying and that will include abolishing the boat the Aboriginal welfare of. Well we had a cup of tea.

66
00:09:44,57 --> 00:09:50,65
We all came and went home happy that an organization formed and this was the evolution of fellowship.

67
00:09:51,99 --> 00:10:00,52
Well at that stage it didn't have an as yet so. There was a woman by the name of Lucy woodcock.

68
00:10:01,6 --> 00:10:08,68
She was the president of the Teachers Federation. And also I think President of one of the street.

69
00:10:08,69 --> 00:10:13,43
Organizations for feminism. The United Association of Women.

70
00:10:13,75 --> 00:10:25,48
Lucy lived in George Street where the Regent Hotel is now she was on the first floor there. Huge flat. Lovely.

71
00:10:25,56 --> 00:10:34,53
Big rooms and you'd look down onto the key. Well at that stage I guess she was in her sixty's.

72
00:10:34,56 --> 00:10:46,31
She was a woman who knew how to conduct a meeting and. And she would rule with him and Rod anyhow.

73
00:10:47,81 --> 00:10:51,85
Pearl went to see now Pearl knew a lot of these old famous.

74
00:10:52,4 --> 00:10:55,03
Because Purnell been around Sydney coming

75
00:10:55,03 --> 00:11:01,55
and going for a long time she knew what feminism horse about on one occasion she said to me.

76
00:11:01,6 --> 00:11:07,73
My sister Kathy said Oh I'm not going to vote tomorrow. The elections were on and people said you go and vote.

77
00:11:07,9 --> 00:11:12,41
Some women went to jail. So that you would have that right.

78
00:11:12,42 --> 00:11:19,32
So Perl you lose a pill knew Lucy very well and Lucy offered who fly out for a meeting for the fellowship.

79
00:11:19,95 --> 00:11:24,09
Because Lucy said look if you could look at the station have to give it a name.

80
00:11:24,11 --> 00:11:29,7
So we all got into Lucy's flat now by this time the apparatus people had come good.

81
00:11:29,93 --> 00:11:36,67
I was working on her lap or is people who is working on the rate for people to get them to come to the meeting.

82
00:11:36,68 --> 00:11:44,43
Well Paul didn't have as much of success as I did because there is a lot of people who are very forward thinking people

83
00:11:45,45 --> 00:12:00,53
and some of the cruises care. That was say or any of people they have now and. The stewards. And truly long bottom.

84
00:12:00,55 --> 00:12:03,17
Marian Jackson.

85
00:12:03,19 --> 00:12:13,16
Magnificent painful wonderful people so they came to Lucy's flat and from Redfern a bloke by the name of Ted

86
00:12:13,16 --> 00:12:24,63
and came Ted was one of the very few days who worked in industries and he was a train. I try I am driver In fact I.

87
00:12:26,29 --> 00:12:29,89
I should look him off and I believe he's still living. Now.

88
00:12:33,89 --> 00:12:37,91
And people actually only able to muster three people from Redfern.

89
00:12:38,35 --> 00:12:42,6
And she was a bit ashamed of it she says you can get more of those black.

90
00:12:47,95 --> 00:13:00,68
Anyhow said Lucy Sara chair this meeting most undemocratic I say so. She said all that place all that.

91
00:13:01,6 --> 00:13:10,32
And there was silence and she said well the first things we have to do is get someone to take the minutes. Now I.

92
00:13:10,33 --> 00:13:23,48
Cajoled a friend of mine by the name of Irene Michael. She had an office in Sydney and she ran a typing business and.

93
00:13:23,5 --> 00:13:37,28
A name was Freeman. She had escaped. And that was a price on fact because she was very active duty.

94
00:13:38,72 --> 00:13:45,82
And she came when I asked her to. Because she said one of the first question she asked when she came to Sydney.

95
00:13:46,37 --> 00:13:53,56
But we must try again and it was a bit of a mystery to that none were to be seen.

96
00:13:56,15 --> 00:14:04,34
So when I told her we were involved in it. She said. All right. Face How come.

97
00:14:04,35 --> 00:14:09,46
Funny woman in a way but she came along and she was a very good shorthand typist

98
00:14:10,95 --> 00:14:14,83
and so we said Well aren't you take the minute she said. All right.

99
00:14:14,86 --> 00:14:24,75
But you people remember this is my living and I'm doing going to do this for nothing. Yes we said well thank you Ira.

100
00:14:24,86 --> 00:14:29,58
In fact you do. If we hadn't a cracker of course needless to say.

101
00:14:29,96 --> 00:14:42,55
Now the extraordinary thing about it was that it seemed the Aboriginal people were waiting for this to happen.

102
00:14:43,09 --> 00:14:50,42
Just waiting for it to happen because Pearl had said to them which what if any church.

103
00:14:50,44 --> 00:14:58,82
And we don't want any political parties. And that nobody's going to dominate this organization.

104
00:14:59,79 --> 00:15:08,52
Well that thought this was code they didn't want to be told what to do. They wanted to make the decision.

105
00:15:08,99 --> 00:15:12,3
That was very clear to me. Carol very early.

106
00:15:13,94 --> 00:15:20,26
Well one of the first things on the agenda was that we should fund the organization

107
00:15:21,02 --> 00:15:25,97
and this is fresh in my memory it all happened yesterday.

108
00:15:27,26 --> 00:15:38,7
Someone said let's call it he said Oh I have been thinking about this and I thought we should include the words.

109
00:15:38,71 --> 00:15:43,91
And it went on to speak about the founder of the.

110
00:15:43,92 --> 00:15:50,68
Fellowship of Australian writers and have fellowship brought people together and we want to bring the black

111
00:15:50,68 --> 00:15:56,77
and white people together and let's call it fellowship. Well it was agreement that that word could be.

112
00:15:56,78 --> 00:16:11,5
And then we all went on and. I would suggest that we call it the Aboriginal Australian. And the tram driver said.

113
00:16:11,52 --> 00:16:25,48
Don't use that word. And Lucy. Which word use if you're referring to. He said that word. She said He said her.

114
00:16:25,56 --> 00:16:39,91
Strongly and he said the other one. He said what we'll get he said is some callers. We've had enough of that.

115
00:16:41,74 --> 00:16:43,79
That the people from lapper are said.

116
00:16:47,05 --> 00:16:54,17
And what's wrong with that you know put up a battle and said Ted saw the light and accepted it.

117
00:16:55,73 --> 00:17:00,95
And it's my opinion that that organization. To think.

118
00:17:01,07 --> 00:17:11,16
And have a title that I think Lou that there were good Aboriginal gave contributed to the dignity of the hip ritual

119
00:17:11,16 --> 00:17:22,44
people of New South Wales. More and more people began to come out and say you know. I found that meeting.

120
00:17:23,29 --> 00:17:35,77
Very moving because I had never in fact fully realised what it was like to be an Aboriginal person.

121
00:17:36,91 --> 00:17:51,34
And it made me feel I valued my. My freedom. That no one could come. And to our house and take me away.

122
00:17:52,52 --> 00:17:56,92
That wasn't quite as much as no one could come and say you can't.

123
00:17:58,27 --> 00:18:08,58
Or you're not entitled to it or you can't come to this school is a special school for you. You can only live there.

124
00:18:10,16 --> 00:18:16,41
That is area that the gap and said you could Lizzie. And if you want to go across the border.

125
00:18:16,85 --> 00:18:24,56
You have to come and get permission from us all of these things and the people set around and talked about the.

126
00:18:26,28 --> 00:18:40,01
Restrictions on their lives and per the fact that the organization that was carrying out

127
00:18:40,93 --> 00:18:50,48
and supervising these restrictions was the Habersham welfare. And if we didn't do nothing. We had to get rid of that.

128
00:18:52,03 --> 00:18:59,66
And let the people the people the rules and laws of the state government.

129
00:18:59,68 --> 00:19:08,95
Now issues a very politically advanced woman talking. And she had many years of experience behind her like me.

130
00:19:10,54 --> 00:19:23,94
In her own people. So for us. The main meeting didn't end until we agreed that we'd have a function to raise money.

131
00:19:26,98 --> 00:19:28,42
For the kitty.

132
00:19:28,44 --> 00:19:35,16
And Irene kept saying look I've got an office and you can use Martellus and providing you pay the bill for your call.

133
00:19:36,27 --> 00:19:41,45
And she is now I say you know but she held us together in a way.

134
00:19:41,76 --> 00:19:49,78
And said and you can come in and out of the office whenever you want to. You can come after five o'clock.

135
00:19:49,8 --> 00:19:56,09
And the office was you know wonderful situation writing to mention and very nice

136
00:19:56,09 --> 00:20:01,24
and it filled with sunshine during the winter. And that was very nice.

137
00:20:02,92 --> 00:20:12,05
And we're grateful we behave ourselves and we didn't abuse her office and was overjoyed and saluted.

138
00:20:12,07 --> 00:20:19,8
She was brewing with excitement. So after it was all open Lucy made a cup of tea which cetera.

139
00:20:20,03 --> 00:20:25,01
And I had taken a big packet of Arnott's biscuits and biscuits and a cup of tea.

140
00:20:25,56 --> 00:20:33,68
And we thought we'd done well for the evening. And they left it to me to find out how we could find F.

141
00:20:33,68 --> 00:20:43,73
Where we could have a public. To raise some money. Well I had one time the friendship of my landlady of mine.

142
00:20:45,12 --> 00:20:50,16
And her husband had just completed a huge house.

143
00:20:50,79 --> 00:20:59,95
For the family at Golden on the no sure he'd built it out of the local pinks he was a stonemason.

144
00:21:00,16 --> 00:21:05,89
And she said Oh my house is there I went and saw her and said simple.

145
00:21:06,47 --> 00:21:11,74
We have to raise some money for the fellowship and she says oh I want to be in the Phillips ship

146
00:21:11,74 --> 00:21:15,21
and you could help us and we can have.

147
00:21:16,38 --> 00:21:19,41
A musical leave me because she was a friend of poverty

148
00:21:19,41 --> 00:21:25,18
and Paul Williams You can have a musical evening at our house the piano too.

149
00:21:25,77 --> 00:21:31,68
And we don't have to have a bag and we'll take up a collection. And it was.

150
00:21:32,91 --> 00:21:44,36
So the evening was organized with Paul coming along and a singer by then I have Mary McClintock.

151
00:21:45,95 --> 00:22:03,27
And Mary was a student of Paul Williams. And I had become friendly with an Aboriginal person who was on a scholarship.

152
00:22:03,29 --> 00:22:11,18
To have her voice trained and she'd come to Sydney looking for a teacher and I took her to a pool.

153
00:22:12,59 --> 00:22:16,85
She was a very advanced sing about the name of Nancy. ALICE.

154
00:22:18,25 --> 00:22:25,33
And as Paul said at first her voice was all over the place but he soon got it together and it was held very.

155
00:22:25,56 --> 00:22:37,36
Tightly and she had a magnificent control. She was very advanced musically. She came along.

156
00:22:37,38 --> 00:22:42,18
She didn't sing that evening she just sat there because she wanted to support the fellowship.

157
00:22:42,76 --> 00:22:46,95
And then later she said Well I'll give her a cycle to raise some funds

158
00:22:47,77 --> 00:22:51,55
and that came later they were wonderful evenings

159
00:22:51,55 --> 00:23:02,41
and we had the music of the very base for the fellowship nothing less with Paul and Bob But you know forefront.

160
00:23:03,18 --> 00:23:17,36
So we raised over two hundred pounds which was quite considerable. Then we said we had to that's right.

161
00:23:18,65 --> 00:23:26,64
We raised this money and we had the money in the kitty which was held by.

162
00:23:26,65 --> 00:23:34,77
I think Irene activists are in great treasure and she knew how to be careful believe you me.

163
00:23:34,79 --> 00:23:40,84
For a little while until we got a treasure but then we said we had to have a public meeting.

164
00:23:40,86 --> 00:23:48,03
So that we could at least more people to support us so we sent invitations out to the unions

165
00:23:48,03 --> 00:23:54,62
and the churches who wouldn't have a thing to mention. Jesse.

166
00:23:54,64 --> 00:24:03,46
She would arrange that we could have the United Association of Women. Free afraid.

167
00:24:03,48 --> 00:24:06,58
That she and Lucy were involved that they said we could.

168
00:24:06,59 --> 00:24:13,7
So we got invitations asked for people to come to a public meeting. And the meeting was held in the place was packed.

169
00:24:14,9 --> 00:24:21,05
And schoolteachers came at him. And I just ask you where that was where the meeting was held.

170
00:24:22,18 --> 00:24:30,55
So the meeting was held there in the room so that you know it. Association who women sixty one Market Street Sydney.

171
00:24:31,5 --> 00:24:32,86
Very well known to the famous.

172
00:24:36,05 --> 00:24:43,99
And so we called we only had a sort of temporary executive to say there was president he was president

173
00:24:43,99 --> 00:24:48,62
and secretary treasurer.

174
00:24:48,66 --> 00:25:00,02
So the main thing was open to elect an executive and people nominated and among the nominees was Pearl

175
00:25:00,89 --> 00:25:11,23
and a great Aboriginal leader who was very involved with that social reform. William Ferguson.

176
00:25:12,08 --> 00:25:20,6
And it was a nominated and there was ten people still lean towards my.

177
00:25:21,41 --> 00:25:28,58
Presidents of organisations women could be secretaries and get on with the work.

178
00:25:31,59 --> 00:25:44,49
The election for president and the day after that which it was for quite some years. She had initiated the groundwork.

179
00:25:44,51 --> 00:25:56,53
And I wouldn't electors prison. And vanished. But we got the organization go in and we kept it.

180
00:25:57,57 --> 00:26:06,15
So I could understand why people warned us against political parties wanting to take it over

181
00:26:06,15 --> 00:26:14,8
and so forth because there was a strong move by the Labor Party members of the Labor Party to move

182
00:26:15,61 --> 00:26:21,22
and dominate there was a strong move by member of the Liberal Party to do the same thing.

183
00:26:21,41 --> 00:26:25,47
To say nothing of the Communist Party over there in a big.

184
00:26:26,01 --> 00:26:33,54
And this went on that we were the whole time we were able to keep it fairly straight these people did it

185
00:26:33,55 --> 00:26:45,87
and I were always very vocal. And I'm sure that during the call it was considered. A raid organization.

186
00:26:45,89 --> 00:26:55,91
But it was it was not. Now short while after a couple of years. That was in nineteen fifty six.

187
00:26:56,81 --> 00:27:08,25
Well it was in nineteen fifty seven. That Jesse one called me in to town to meet her on the Saturday afternoon.

188
00:27:09,63 --> 00:27:11,96
And I went into town and we met.

189
00:27:15,19 --> 00:27:28,64
The that was the lawyer for the fellowship an honorary I might mention bad the name of Christian jolly Smith one of the

190
00:27:28,64 --> 00:27:39,66
if. Women to graduate but certainly the first woman to establish her own legal company in Sydney.

191
00:27:41,08 --> 00:27:47,91
And she looked after us kept us out of jail half the time because we were prepared to gamble

192
00:27:47,91 --> 00:28:01,68
and do all kinds of things to raise money. Anyhow. And she helped. The constitution. But. Yes that's right.

193
00:28:01,85 --> 00:28:10,21
So yes he called me and he was a very good friend of the Christian church. And we met in Christian's office afternoon.

194
00:28:10,65 --> 00:28:13,8
And yes he had also called.

195
00:28:13,82 --> 00:28:15,97
As president of the fellowship

196
00:28:16,94 --> 00:28:25,4
and the four of us now Jesse previously had been talking to me about the need for a federal body. And the need.

197
00:28:26,6 --> 00:28:37,45
Very leary mentions I think a better referendum but he went over my continent. And that afternoon she came in.

198
00:28:37,47 --> 00:28:47,57
And she was wearing a pink dress that had little black. And she'd just taken her hat off and had running the.

199
00:28:48,24 --> 00:28:59,73
Through which was now spinning. And she sat there and when I came in she said. Thank you for coming.

200
00:29:03,11 --> 00:29:14,55
She took over immediately and she said. Now here is. Petition.

201
00:29:15,86 --> 00:29:21,25
And I would like to know that fellowship she was already a patron of the fellowship.

202
00:29:21,27 --> 00:29:27,39
And she said I would like the Fellowship would. Approve the petition and circulate it.

203
00:29:29,01 --> 00:29:34,52
And I asked her what the petition was for and she said didn't explain

204
00:29:34,52 --> 00:29:42,2
and it was for the federal government to call a referendum to change the federal Constitution.

205
00:29:42,21 --> 00:29:54,13
And I thought of all of us poverty stricken organisms How do you do it. With a membership of about twenty.

206
00:29:54,96 --> 00:30:00,57
Who's going to change the country was going to change the federal Constitution and I let it.

207
00:30:00,63 --> 00:30:09,75
I put it out of my mind it was too big to comprehend. And she'd already sent that copy.

208
00:30:10,41 --> 00:30:14,98
And he had his and it was pretty crumpled and had.

209
00:30:14,99 --> 00:30:22,63
Plumber's finger marks on it because he'd been showing it around Parliament House where he pointed to supply.

210
00:30:22,65 --> 00:30:36,58
In parliament. It's she thanked me again for coming in. And she said you know I put my money on new meaning.

211
00:30:37,16 --> 00:30:43,58
She'd back me. But that didn't mean much when I went out and hopped in the car and. It was lovely.

212
00:30:46,22 --> 00:30:51,81
I got home and went back to the garden which I'd left that morning I was putting submenu around the place.

213
00:30:52,3 --> 00:31:03,03
Went back and finished off in the afternoon. And I didn't think much more about that petition. I turned it off.

214
00:31:03,07 --> 00:31:03,69
We'll have coffee.
