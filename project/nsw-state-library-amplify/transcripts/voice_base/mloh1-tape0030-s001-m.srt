1
00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:05,19
Sydney harbour bridge builders frank miller
green carpenter. Do you member those

2
00:00:05,19 --> 00:00:11,64
times do you mr belligerent over you. Well
there in january nineteen. That he and i

3
00:00:11,64 --> 00:00:18,26
finished about september 1932 and was about
eight months after it opened. What was

4
00:00:18,26 --> 00:00:20,04
your job. Exactly. I was a carpenter

5
00:00:20,04 --> 00:00:26,97
a construction work. Form work during all
of rome work for the bridge approach. All

6
00:00:26,97 --> 00:00:31,95
the concrete roads and the
parapet walls. They were made in

7
00:00:31,95 --> 00:00:38,80
a factory underneath the bridge
on the north side. In the inner

8
00:00:38,80 --> 00:00:45,56
workshop and they were sent there. I was
up in sections and we are erected on the

9
00:00:45,57 --> 00:00:51,15
road where or wherever they had to go.
Was it hard work very hard work as way

10
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:55,84
things were very hard and those days because
the depression was all over. Well on

11
00:00:56,71 --> 00:01:02,60
and everybody up the end of days. Worked.
And there was no life and then i can say

12
00:01:02,60 --> 00:01:06,94
there's that for all the years
we were there was never

13
00:01:06,94 --> 00:01:12,57
a strike or ever in the industrial double
except for those that work for doing one

14
00:01:12,57 --> 00:01:17,23
longs they struck the little while the
high money which they got i think they got

15
00:01:17,23 --> 00:01:23,40
six times. On our money. How many carpenters
were you working on the approaches at

16
00:01:23,40 --> 00:01:28,02
the north side. Well i can't imagine i can't
tell you really but they were only in

17
00:01:28,02 --> 00:01:34,92
the hundreds hundreds of them our
engineer headman and i'll supervisor.

18
00:01:35,05 --> 00:01:35,76
Say it was mr.

19
00:01:35,76 --> 00:01:42,50
Roper. I think you enjoy pretty was named
and foreman and there was ted ledbury

20
00:01:43,59 --> 00:01:44,00
and then of course

21
00:01:44,00 --> 00:01:49,51
a couple awaiting him in charge of different
gangs. We were all in sections. I

22
00:01:49,51 --> 00:01:55,30
worked on the north side exclusively on the
ground then from the station more and.

23
00:01:56,39 --> 00:02:01,04
No certainly staged and then mills and bowen
station which was known as cura billy

24
00:02:01,04 --> 00:02:07,14
station on them. Those then that
james do you remember you had

25
00:02:07,14 --> 00:02:12,96
a in one gang. How many countries where
then how many labourers be about twenty and

26
00:02:13,96 --> 00:02:19,21
some time one number of libraries because
i know i have to be handled manually.

27
00:02:20,19 --> 00:02:22,68
There were any crimes ending like

28
00:02:22,68 --> 00:02:26,19
a lift anything is that we
really just manhandled in

29
00:02:27,12 --> 00:02:33,01
a truck something like that and barrows
but and all the work was done by him. It

30
00:02:33,01 --> 00:02:39,54
was no machine. Experience even when the
current great was probably there was no

31
00:02:39,54 --> 00:02:46,26
ready mix concrete and days it was all done
by big mixes concrete mixers which held

32
00:02:46,26 --> 00:02:47,29
a cubic yard

33
00:02:47,29 --> 00:02:52,44
a concrete they were big ones i think there
were about twelve of them and they were

34
00:02:52,44 --> 00:02:59,13
down at the bottom on the ground level
and the concrete was mixed there.

35
00:02:59,15 --> 00:02:59,72
Make there's

36
00:02:59,72 --> 00:03:06,28
a through you know by the
papers that the crushed spoil

37
00:03:07,04 --> 00:03:12,35
from mariah carey was crushed in the current
grate and that comprise the metal part

38
00:03:12,35 --> 00:03:16,89
of the concrete they were mixed and
they were put in a vehicle called

39
00:03:16,89 --> 00:03:18,59
a rickshaw which was

40
00:03:18,59 --> 00:03:24,49
a v-shaped truck with big world
as they were soon as a send up by

41
00:03:24,49 --> 00:03:29,80
a lift up onto the landing and that
was run along on the track barges

42
00:03:29,80 --> 00:03:34,77
a two men push of the long and that's how
the concrete was bought with our buy

43
00:03:34,77 --> 00:03:40,76
everything was done by him with all those
work. How many country can do you think

44
00:03:40,76 --> 00:03:45,60
there were ten. Yes there would
be ten then things. It was

45
00:03:45,60 --> 00:03:51,62
a continual more as it kept going until
of thing was poor. They didn't write the

46
00:03:51,62 --> 00:03:58,16
columns of the buttresses that held the
road where. They were built. First of

47
00:03:58,16 --> 00:04:04,98
course and. They had some sailboats
and them which were used for

48
00:04:06,01 --> 00:04:11,76
lifting us scaffold up. That's our
framework was in and then we they were in

49
00:04:13,43 --> 00:04:20,22
cardboard container tubes and they
were pulled out when the. How

50
00:04:20,22 --> 00:04:26,23
was on and when they when the lift of
our they were taken out and how the

51
00:04:27,11 --> 00:04:33,86
timber frame where of the foam worked.
They were they were put in the game to out

52
00:04:33,86 --> 00:04:39,90
the framework together and that's out the
thing was build up so it was more or less

53
00:04:39,90 --> 00:04:45,50
at its. Ascending. Type
of scaffolding that was

54
00:04:45,50 --> 00:04:49,77
a modern sort of idea for those days when
it was years because they used everybody

55
00:04:49,77 --> 00:04:53,44
is there a big braces and
traps and things but this was

56
00:04:53,44 --> 00:04:58,82
a very good idea and those marks are still
on the brown they would but if someone

57
00:04:58,82 --> 00:05:05,66
went to look we have the house
were there with the tube and

58
00:05:05,67 --> 00:05:12,22
the long brown through as they are about
three feet now about three. And they print

59
00:05:12,22 --> 00:05:18,77
projected so far some more timber up
there. Well if they have the mills and the

60
00:05:18,77 --> 00:05:21,76
rain where got. There's

61
00:05:21,76 --> 00:05:26,29
a very neat you know who was responsible
for that system. Now i don't because it

62
00:05:26,29 --> 00:05:32,70
started when i got air but i don't know
i was in charge of it but mr wright was

63
00:05:32,70 --> 00:05:37,66
like the engineer in charge of
construction i'm over there and he was

64
00:05:37,66 --> 00:05:44,49
a rather clever man and that may have been
his or their do you remember the overall

65
00:05:44,49 --> 00:05:50,27
form and their. Our overall warming of our
games. You know it was them generally

66
00:05:50,27 --> 00:05:52,56
but with ted ledbury he was

67
00:05:52,56 --> 00:05:56,44
a great big that of alan. I'm very
content you do. By the way very stern

68
00:05:57,38 --> 00:06:03,60
a very strict we did and he did it at all
although many years after i met him in

69
00:06:03,60 --> 00:06:08,88
the public works where i work from twenty
one years later on and we become the best

70
00:06:08,88 --> 00:06:15,02
of friends. He's dead now. For exactly.
Do you remember the general public works

71
00:06:15,02 --> 00:06:20,78
for him and then the shepherd.
Here's there and he was

72
00:06:20,78 --> 00:06:21,95
a little chap

73
00:06:21,95 --> 00:06:28,68
a small very small mountain
stages but he was very

74
00:06:28,69 --> 00:06:33,96
well very popular among the
people there don't try

75
00:06:33,96 --> 00:06:39,05
a side or as some of them and you got the
sack straightaway. Who. What about him

76
00:06:39,05 --> 00:06:42,64
did what stories were there to
tell about him was he was he

77
00:06:42,64 --> 00:06:47,92
a hard man. Well it was very very strict
and if he didn't like the look in your

78
00:06:47,92 --> 00:06:54,81
face if you went. That was all i can say
about him i wouldn't say any more. That's

79
00:06:54,81 --> 00:06:57,54
a pity. And there was

80
00:06:57,54 --> 00:07:03,91
a couple of accusations made on the approaches
of. Blokes in authority asking for.

81
00:07:05,13 --> 00:07:09,20
For something at the fella's wages of the
firm. You never hear anything like that.

82
00:07:10,20 --> 00:07:15,42
Yes i did hear that was one of them but
because i know want to speak about the

83
00:07:15,42 --> 00:07:19,00
people probably a bit but.
There was a lot of tories

84
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:24,06
a groom one of very pleasant valley. We'll

85
00:07:27,65 --> 00:07:28,95
remember how you first got the job as

86
00:07:28,95 --> 00:07:34,80
a cup draw the approaches to. Yes well
things were very bad at that time and we

87
00:07:34,80 --> 00:07:39,82
were on. On the dole as a no and there was

88
00:07:39,82 --> 00:07:45,77
a call up in the pipe of no some none
when twelve hundred carpenters wanted

89
00:07:46,80 --> 00:07:53,52
and we got the report of the key labor
bureau station at circular quay.

90
00:07:54,77 --> 00:07:58,16
I went down my number was
fourteen hundred. But making

91
00:07:58,16 --> 00:08:01,23
a return so yeah we had
we were supposed to have

92
00:08:01,23 --> 00:08:06,99
a look. Preppers that went down there at
about eleven o'clock after the riots and

93
00:08:06,99 --> 00:08:12,74
trouble and all that was over. And i saw
the chap on the counter and i gave him

94
00:08:12,74 --> 00:08:16,86
a card and said can you do anything
with this. He's a liar you're a bit of

95
00:08:16,86 --> 00:08:19,90
a no he said but when i mean it is

96
00:08:19,90 --> 00:08:26,60
a neural digger i said you first were bigger
these are coming. So i took me in the

97
00:08:26,60 --> 00:08:29,67
weather room where the dead man was it was

98
00:08:29,67 --> 00:08:35,87
a very hard man to deal with to get his
name and he looked me up and down these

99
00:08:35,87 --> 00:08:38,13
were sort of a garden and i was

100
00:08:38,13 --> 00:08:43,62
a mobile you good guy and now he said
what's all the work you do i think if you

101
00:08:43,62 --> 00:08:50,38
want to work like i said fixing work
journey where roofing current great.

102
00:08:50,40 --> 00:08:54,95
Anything you want i can do it and
he said can you work up against

103
00:08:54,95 --> 00:09:00,28
a man on the bridge on the bench. I said
yes. Journey work. I said yeah i know all

104
00:09:00,28 --> 00:09:07,17
about it. And he said well
they weren't joiners over the

105
00:09:07,17 --> 00:09:12,96
bridge. I know he found it because because
that was the job of jobs. So he gave me

106
00:09:12,96 --> 00:09:18,53
a ticket to go over there and i went home
and the ferry makes mining the great big

107
00:09:18,53 --> 00:09:23,30
box of true joiners. And worked about half

108
00:09:23,30 --> 00:09:28,47
a mile to the headquarters where they
joined the shop whereas i asked for the

109
00:09:29,90 --> 00:09:34,44
foreman join in and i said i've
been told to come in for a job is

110
00:09:34,45 --> 00:09:38,69
a lie don't want to me during these alarms
all of them now is packed and they eyes

111
00:09:38,69 --> 00:09:44,67
but i'm. I want to make 100 men. Why didn't
they tell me i think that's when i am

112
00:09:44,67 --> 00:09:49,92
like you can't read word. I just finished
three years with power hours where i was

113
00:09:49,92 --> 00:09:50,62
as

114
00:09:50,62 --> 00:09:57,27
a carpenter out there that was all trump
great work so he set me up to the. Ted

115
00:09:57,27 --> 00:10:01,95
ledbury was a foreman and that's
how i started i only died with

116
00:10:01,95 --> 00:10:08,55
a pose that they didn't want joiners job
gone. So i would have very pleased to get

117
00:10:08,55 --> 00:10:12,72
out there and we were very grateful for
that job but i was lucky enough to last.

118
00:10:13,03 --> 00:10:17,83
Just on three years on the job. So that
was relief work here. Was it always that

119
00:10:17,83 --> 00:10:23,11
full time work. We're russian that
time i just started the rationing days

120
00:10:23,11 --> 00:10:25,04
a week we worked for four days

121
00:10:25,04 --> 00:10:30,99
a week and i think my money was about
four pound and twopence a week for

122
00:10:30,99 --> 00:10:36,93
a day's work. They did that to. Spread
the work out and give more people work.

123
00:10:38,48 --> 00:10:44,76
There was a good idea. Well yes i did i
think the home. Leave and everybody having

124
00:10:44,76 --> 00:10:48,65
a share of the cake and i gave them

125
00:10:48,65 --> 00:10:55,48
a few more people some work i was able
to keep two families going then and. You

126
00:10:55,48 --> 00:11:00,42
know keep us in food and well what
have you and that for a pound

127
00:11:00,42 --> 00:11:03,52
a week covered as on there
is days. Things are

128
00:11:03,52 --> 00:11:08,26
a lot cheaper and them though they are now
keeping two families going. You wouldn't

129
00:11:08,26 --> 00:11:14,47
have to was that you know i my brother and
i was out of work when his girl baby and

130
00:11:14,48 --> 00:11:20,91
we had one and my baby only little kiddies
and i don't mind do it was only two year

131
00:11:20,91 --> 00:11:22,63
old and i don't. And she well as

132
00:11:22,63 --> 00:11:28,52
a bridge and. We were labeled i was
able to provide for both of us

133
00:11:29,49 --> 00:11:34,30
three years. This is quite something
before that we were on the delta how long.

134
00:11:35,11 --> 00:11:40,59
Well grateful that i was lucky i had been
working at sort of steady counsel had

135
00:11:40,60 --> 00:11:47,42
done wrong paras i was there for three years
for nineteen the end of 1929 and then

136
00:11:47,42 --> 00:11:53,08
in january thirty one thirty. I got the
job on the bridge. So i never felt the

137
00:11:53,08 --> 00:11:59,14
depression really until the end of the
thirty two but i really felt that after that

138
00:11:59,14 --> 00:12:00,31
. Thirty four. It was

139
00:12:00,31 --> 00:12:06,83
a very grim. When the dole and we're right
on the dole yes they were very hard. We

140
00:12:06,83 --> 00:12:12,86
finished up being put on relief work on
live on hurstville and not as that my place

141
00:12:12,86 --> 00:12:13,13
is

142
00:12:13,13 --> 00:12:18,97
a big storm or the channel and they made
us work for our money then we work so many

143
00:12:18,97 --> 00:12:19,22
hours

144
00:12:19,22 --> 00:12:25,83
a week on great work over there and. I was
you know again i'm trying to write what

145
00:12:25,83 --> 00:12:31,75
i was there till 1934. But it didn't amount
to much of the amount of dough about

146
00:12:31,75 --> 00:12:38,49
sixteen shillings a week as what we got and
it was called relief work was that was

147
00:12:38,49 --> 00:12:43,57
a relief work they started that everybody
was you know it bank managers and clerks

148
00:12:43,57 --> 00:12:48,10
and everything british people as they some
of the poor fellows trying to shovel mud

149
00:12:48,10 --> 00:12:54,60
out of these slimy. Snow more
that you know not canals

150
00:12:55,43 --> 00:13:01,29
and went right from pinned down to beverly
hills where i lived there and in fact

151
00:13:01,29 --> 00:13:07,37
the passes my door. The storm or the
canal. There were many of those jobs going

152
00:13:07,37 --> 00:13:13,31
where there. Well the every district had
it all gender barrier and no other part of

153
00:13:13,31 --> 00:13:18,07
it. They call muddy creek and

154
00:13:20,12 --> 00:13:22,52
down down the ground. There's

155
00:13:22,52 --> 00:13:27,19
a big wide one down there and over to
it's canterbury and there's a big one

156
00:13:27,19 --> 00:13:32,36
a very wide one over there and it spreads
all over the metropolitan area as the

157
00:13:32,36 --> 00:13:37,41
liberal party were in power at that
time that they got rid of jack land and

158
00:13:37,42 --> 00:13:43,80
unfortunately and they. They started to put
that stuff on to make it work for your

159
00:13:43,80 --> 00:13:49,83
money but. Webs our things were done.
While you were working on the bridge you

160
00:13:49,83 --> 00:13:54,68
remember any accidents that happened down
there. Well not personally not near me

161
00:13:54,68 --> 00:14:01,64
and not on the plane approaches they were
many many of their odd ones. Dressed

162
00:14:01,64 --> 00:14:03,65
a bank or something like
that where a slip with

163
00:14:03,65 --> 00:14:08,76
a barrow. But i saw the one the
one when i nearly saw i saw

164
00:14:08,76 --> 00:14:14,05
a near or part of it at the jap that
recovered from an accident. I think his name

165
00:14:14,05 --> 00:14:15,51
was kili. It was

166
00:14:15,51 --> 00:14:21,26
a reagan and he fell off the deck which
is one hundred ninety nine feet above sea

167
00:14:21,26 --> 00:14:27,32
level. And they're about that and i'd say
out of the tops about one hundred four

168
00:14:27,32 --> 00:14:32,83
hundred two feet above sea level. I live
fell off the level of the deck but being

169
00:14:32,83 --> 00:14:35,36
you know. I'm experienced
swimmer and either

170
00:14:36,07 --> 00:14:40,77
a new out of all in the world. I mean
certainly you know the prelims all round to

171
00:14:40,77 --> 00:14:45,61
go for it. Held exams over the
years ahead which i yesterday was

172
00:14:45,61 --> 00:14:51,76
a day over there myself and the end of the
water was strong and honest. And there

173
00:14:52,56 --> 00:14:57,99
he came down. He came up these went to
about nearby and they want to go back to

174
00:14:57,99 --> 00:15:02,75
work. They wouldn't let him go back there
made it go home at the aftershock my

175
00:15:02,75 --> 00:15:07,58
lappets upset him however he was one of
the very few that recovered from that

176
00:15:07,58 --> 00:15:12,30
accident. There was one carpenter killed
on the approaches in the fitzroy she went

177
00:15:12,30 --> 00:15:18,52
there then. No i didn't. Now that that's
why i was that north sydney. Yes there was

178
00:15:18,52 --> 00:15:21,57
a collapse there shattering collapsed and

179
00:15:21,57 --> 00:15:26,32
a car went down and killed. That's right.
I can remember that i'd only meant that

180
00:15:26,32 --> 00:15:32,49
jap get and i could have remembered it
was just now is my problem. My memory. I

181
00:15:32,49 --> 00:15:37,52
used to when they were putting the shutters
on the road which is three foot thick.

182
00:15:38,51 --> 00:15:44,99
I always had the job. Of being on the
scaffold under me with an oilskin and

183
00:15:45,94 --> 00:15:47,74
sou'wester hat on and

184
00:15:47,74 --> 00:15:54,38
a big spanner looking at the door of the
concrete and making sure that nothing

185
00:15:54,38 --> 00:15:59,36
collapsed and nothing went wrong and
i had to collapse and i had a i had

186
00:15:59,36 --> 00:16:06,27
a bell. I can ring. If anything happened
during that bell and we used to stop

187
00:16:06,27 --> 00:16:12,27
the poor come and fix the fault but there
was never any fall while i was doing it.

188
00:16:12,99 --> 00:16:18,66
I done that tactically every problem that
i was worked on. I work there is to get

189
00:16:19,36 --> 00:16:25,16
an hour extra for wet money for doing
that and i hope that what your as

190
00:16:25,16 --> 00:16:32,00
a crime prove that there was no collapse
or damage done to the storm where some of

191
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:35,51
those arches there know sydney particularly
fitzroy street and levon the street

192
00:16:35,51 --> 00:16:42,21
which are going to go arches they were they
were they were big big slabs. They were

193
00:16:42,21 --> 00:16:48,97
well constructed. Because the
reinforcing of those roads. Are as j's

194
00:16:48,97 --> 00:16:55,40
right around steel joists and their
two foot six high wide and long

195
00:16:56,75 --> 00:17:02,37
and twelve inches wide and they were placed
three inches apart from each other and

196
00:17:03,25 --> 00:17:07,73
they were three inches up from the bottom
and three inches down from the top and

197
00:17:07,73 --> 00:17:12,69
all the rest was pure concrete went into
them and that's what all along that road

198
00:17:12,69 --> 00:17:18,70
where bill got right. Because i was there
while they were doing it. That was an

199
00:17:18,70 --> 00:17:19,51
expensive way to build

200
00:17:19,51 --> 00:17:26,25
a road. It's it may be but now we're just
ordinary reinforcing its solid royals

201
00:17:26,25 --> 00:17:32,27
round steel joists and there we have forever
that road will never go impossible.

202
00:17:32,47 --> 00:17:37,76
There are about thirty odd feet wide. I
think between each buttress. And they were

203
00:17:37,76 --> 00:17:42,14
arresting them they were about two feet at
the top and about three or four feet at

204
00:17:42,14 --> 00:17:49,12
the bottom type but then after the bridge
was finished rebuild shops under them and

205
00:17:49,13 --> 00:17:49,84
lined i haven't of

206
00:17:49,84 --> 00:17:55,45
a road side. We built shops and the
government got it. The least amount

207
00:17:56,95 --> 00:18:02,22
due to member. The day that they've got the
record for pouring the lavender street

208
00:18:02,22 --> 00:18:05,71
shrink 500 cubic yards in
the one day where there was

209
00:18:05,71 --> 00:18:10,43
a well that was done. You know i may have
been part of it. I don't know whether i

210
00:18:10,43 --> 00:18:17,13
was in that gang but we were all separate
gang were mixed around. But i remember i

211
00:18:17,13 --> 00:18:20,02
was there that day one when
that was done that was

212
00:18:20,02 --> 00:18:25,74
a very good. They were late to get it all
down. Never stop the poor ones those

213
00:18:25,74 --> 00:18:32,63
don't know that those they kept would
go on and. The parapets of course

214
00:18:32,63 --> 00:18:37,14
were built after the floor was there
were the road workers there and that was

215
00:18:37,14 --> 00:18:43,91
another set of. For my work. That's all.
And that pattern continues right through

216
00:18:43,91 --> 00:18:49,48
the bridge from the north to those outside
that was owned by going to plaster isn't

217
00:18:49,48 --> 00:18:55,89
it will go and buy carpenters first with
form work and then they would it was

218
00:18:55,89 --> 00:19:02,69
rendered over by plasters and each in
its batteries has got an expansion

219
00:19:02,69 --> 00:19:09,67
joint of three inches of pitch
and cork mixed together and as

220
00:19:09,67 --> 00:19:10,27
we put

221
00:19:10,27 --> 00:19:17,08
a slab in one section. We take the end
section off from work and then nail this

222
00:19:18,07 --> 00:19:24,31
section of the bitumen do it and that was
an expansion you know and i've seen it in

223
00:19:24,31 --> 00:19:30,80
the summertime about an inch wide and then
the wintertime three inches wide. That's

224
00:19:30,80 --> 00:19:36,54
the expanse of concrete. That was done
right through the bridge. That there's

225
00:19:36,54 --> 00:19:40,01
northern approaches were done in just
over two years when they didn't take

226
00:19:40,01 --> 00:19:46,42
a long time now but two years i was there
the rest of that time we built the

227
00:19:46,42 --> 00:19:52,69
station i worked on nelson torrens station.
Used to be killer billy station and i

228
00:19:52,69 --> 00:19:57,03
think. The rich people out there didn't
like the name and they made them change it

229
00:19:57,03 --> 00:20:03,94
. My companion my mate and i and we
fixed out the station like putting the

230
00:20:03,94 --> 00:20:10,65
doors and windows in the states and those
they are they the same set of doors

231
00:20:10,65 --> 00:20:13,41
and windows because i had a look at them

232
00:20:13,41 --> 00:20:18,50
a little while ago and went by accident to
cross the bridge on the train. And they

233
00:20:18,50 --> 00:20:18,62
had

234
00:20:18,62 --> 00:20:24,23
a look at my own work and it was still there
still working the doors and windows are

235
00:20:24,23 --> 00:20:30,87
still over fifty years ago. That's good
work. You know you can't quite remember how

236
00:20:30,87 --> 00:20:36,36
many gangs of carpenters they were now i
don't i didn't take much notice and them

237
00:20:36,36 --> 00:20:41,62
david we're only concerned with our own
little group and we were in mirror i

238
00:20:41,62 --> 00:20:45,31
wouldn't know our money they were as i
know there were hundreds hundreds of men

239
00:20:45,31 --> 00:20:51,45
working on it and you think there was about
ten concrete mixers. Yes at least ten

240
00:20:51,45 --> 00:20:56,99
great mixers ten or twelve grand great
mixers up to the northern end up near

241
00:20:58,81 --> 00:21:02,55
north sydney station and they were all
their group there and they used to have

242
00:21:02,55 --> 00:21:05,46
a hoist take about the
top and then the men

243
00:21:05,46 --> 00:21:11,42
a library wheeled among tourists and july
came to their position and then they

244
00:21:11,42 --> 00:21:12,26
provided more of

245
00:21:12,26 --> 00:21:19,18
a crime green then they had men stirring
and up shovel agitating it so they

246
00:21:19,18 --> 00:21:23,84
don't even really make them to make their
concrete park as you know we've got one

247
00:21:23,84 --> 00:21:28,14
bloke with a concrete pack as
they crawl and. There was never

248
00:21:28,14 --> 00:21:32,71
a relation in those days. No there was no
vibrators like they've got now and there

249
00:21:32,71 --> 00:21:38,64
is no ready god right now. It was all done
by hand. Now as i was interested in the

250
00:21:38,64 --> 00:21:42,76
contrast between the way diamond lung did
things and the way the public works did

251
00:21:42,76 --> 00:21:47,50
things dome and long had only one concrete
mixer for each pylon and one concrete

252
00:21:47,50 --> 00:21:54,10
mixing gang and they were away for eight
years whereas the public works had ten or

253
00:21:54,10 --> 00:21:55,56
fifteen whole lot only

254
00:21:55,56 --> 00:22:01,37
a short period of time did they they got
stuck in there with that's why they called

255
00:22:01,37 --> 00:22:06,49
out all the carpenters because carpenters
they used to that sort of work is not

256
00:22:06,49 --> 00:22:09,36
a labor of job putting
formwork down the top was

257
00:22:09,36 --> 00:22:15,58
a tried job and it happened very
properly done because that meant a meant

258
00:22:15,58 --> 00:22:20,53
a big thing because you know what you were
doing. Yeah. And everybody up into it

259
00:22:20,53 --> 00:22:21,17
all. Dr.

260
00:22:21,17 --> 00:22:26,44
Bradfield was very friendly man he often
used to walk across the way where we were

261
00:22:26,44 --> 00:22:28,22
working so good

262
00:22:28,22 --> 00:22:33,50
a boys out there and we all drove him doc.
We all liked we were very friendly even

263
00:22:34,19 --> 00:22:37,61
have a laugh and a joke with
us. Keep the good work needs

264
00:22:37,61 --> 00:22:41,95
a and we were all alive. They were weird
you were getting into it. Nobody liked in

265
00:22:41,95 --> 00:22:48,23
them days. You did you could not vote
because you know that jobs were jobs

266
00:22:49,02 --> 00:22:52,09
and the other engineers had you
done with them. Alright. Yes mr.

267
00:22:52,09 --> 00:22:53,30
Roper was

268
00:22:53,31 --> 00:22:59,72
a very friendly man too. I remember one
incident when. They just before finished

269
00:23:00,50 --> 00:23:05,76
they the first official tried went across
the bridge. And my mate was named jack

270
00:23:05,76 --> 00:23:12,70
costigan i think he's dead now. We
were working on breaking the handrail

271
00:23:12,70 --> 00:23:17,93
down the eggs it part of the
station and they had all the

272
00:23:19,39 --> 00:23:24,17
government heads and departments and
then get ready to go under those you'd

273
00:23:24,18 --> 00:23:26,65
photographed. The first official train.
