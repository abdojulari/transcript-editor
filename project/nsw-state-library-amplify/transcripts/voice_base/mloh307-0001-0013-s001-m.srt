1
00:00:21,27 --> 00:00:27,34
Identification. This is Station thirteen with face band.

2
00:00:28,36 --> 00:00:33,27
And Karen Craig and it's recorded on Thursday the fourth of September one thousand nine hundred seventy.

3
00:00:33,83 --> 00:00:43,78
And this is the side. Tapes coming up in a few seconds for faith over to you.

4
00:00:45,35 --> 00:00:48,06
When we all struggle a sion book was published.

5
00:00:48,74 --> 00:00:57,3
There was a great need for that at that particular time because to publish the works of all authors.

6
00:00:58,14 --> 00:01:06,93
Now many people who were left wing had difficulty getting published and this was a good way of overcoming it.

7
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:12,87
It was Frank how does it become a flourishing publishing.

8
00:01:13,56 --> 00:01:21,92
Publishing some of us try to use most famous authors and regrettably.

9
00:01:23,37 --> 00:01:30,3
After But it had a good go I would say for ten years. And how often I became very involved in it.

10
00:01:30,53 --> 00:01:41,1
I became the treasurer at one stage and hundreds became the secretary. For new software. But when it was formed.

11
00:01:41,22 --> 00:01:48,59
Well when there was a chance of raising the works of quite a number of people whom we would not have rated.

12
00:01:51,02 --> 00:02:07,94
So many of the authors were saying to me why don't you write. There was William Hadfield And. Different of course and.

13
00:02:07,96 --> 00:02:17,62
They were getting at me and I thought my God that would be the last thing I could do.

14
00:02:18,63 --> 00:02:27,6
Although I came from a family who were great. All right. And we knew all about the pain and. I never saw so for us.

15
00:02:29,32 --> 00:02:42,88
Well times past. And I had to go to London and.

16
00:02:44,08 --> 00:02:54,89
I haven't been to London for quite some years because as I said previously I didn't have a passport and.

17
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:12,49
I reclaimed nine hundred sixty seven. When I thing went off to new mayor and had a couple of weeks.

18
00:03:12,51 --> 00:03:24,08
So I had a passport and when the invitation came through. I said to write. I love you. I don't think I could live.

19
00:03:24,1 --> 00:03:28,94
But I could stay there for a long time. Previously I was in for eleven months.

20
00:03:29,57 --> 00:03:45,69
And it was lovely to go back to that magnificent city with and. And. And.

21
00:03:46,52 --> 00:03:58,91
It offers me a lot of everything for me when I go to London Bloomsbury. Covent. And the paddock and.

22
00:03:58,92 --> 00:04:07,89
The festival and it's just wonderful. So when the invitation came through. I said oh yes I'm coming.

23
00:04:08,9 --> 00:04:32,93
I have never met before family. So when I. It was at the airport. I knew really it was. It was just like secondhand so.

24
00:04:32,94 --> 00:04:59,67
Now I was. In a hotel in the Ivanhoe. I became. But I hadn't given a lecture to the. Tropical department.

25
00:05:02,42 --> 00:05:21,45
That was very interested in what was happening in the center children. And the doctor. I think. To be a pediatrician.

26
00:05:21,86 --> 00:05:26,84
She had already completed.

27
00:05:30,54 --> 00:05:36,74
Become very good friends actually but she took care of me and came in the morning

28
00:05:36,74 --> 00:05:53,48
and in the evening to the hotel because. What's actually. And I think she was somewhere.

29
00:05:53,49 --> 00:06:21,12
She is now very very famous in Australia. Lives in practice. Who deals specifically with fear. And. And him.

30
00:06:21,27 --> 00:06:36,21
Came another Australian who came and said pack your suitcase. You're coming to play. I packed up.

31
00:06:36,4 --> 00:06:55,03
He put me and my suitcase in his little car and we went off to where he had a unit.

32
00:06:55,05 --> 00:07:04,54
He is an Australian lawyer so I should say he's back in Sydney or has been there for a long time very different.

33
00:07:07,39 --> 00:07:17,19
And I was leaving London. I'd already been to Geneva and from London. I was to go to Mexico. So I recovered it.

34
00:07:18,4 --> 00:07:28,1
There also placed in front of the. Drinking.

35
00:07:28,12 --> 00:07:36,47
And then he the next night he said well I don't have to know in a nice place. And then on top. You offered Heathrow.

36
00:07:38,46 --> 00:07:48,99
And I said to you now ask me about my people and I told him. My father came from. And he said Isn't it beautiful.

37
00:07:49,38 --> 00:08:03,47
I don't know I've never heard. My father and I. Well it's a great silent happened that he's from here.

38
00:08:05,09 --> 00:08:18,84
And one of the places I stopped there and I thought about this to Mexico. I was doing a job in Mexico for.

39
00:08:22,64 --> 00:08:45,66
The Australian Government. And. Taken care of by High Commission. Through customs and. Hotel arrangements for the job.

40
00:08:46,28 --> 00:09:16,67
And the job was to make a report that knew him and it had been built by primarily. A project. Still very new.

41
00:09:17,15 --> 00:09:28,05
And they took me through one full experience.

42
00:09:28,06 --> 00:09:35,77
They're travelling from Mexico to Australia is very long because you probably know.

43
00:09:37,03 --> 00:09:46,55
So I had plenty of time to think what I was going to do with my life and I thought everyone.

44
00:09:47,78 --> 00:09:52,88
Carried this bloody around in my. And it's ready to jump out.

45
00:09:54,63 --> 00:10:02,69
And now I'm going to do so when I arrived I have recently come for a few days and I'm from.

46
00:10:04,04 --> 00:10:21,14
How would you like to go to Kamya And I said when he said we're off. So we both went off to Kenya and. The Priest.

47
00:10:21,27 --> 00:10:30,9
Yes precedent was what was his. Who was jailed for so long with my arm doesn't matter. It will come out later.

48
00:10:36,25 --> 00:10:41,21
And it's very interested in the struggle of the man for independence in Kenya.

49
00:10:41,66 --> 00:10:46,87
And I couldn't help the British for what they were doing in the African states

50
00:10:46,87 --> 00:10:50,07
and that there is corruption at the level of.

51
00:10:50,67 --> 00:10:59,01
I can say thank you to the British for teaching This is where you get money and money is the most important thing.

52
00:10:59,02 --> 00:11:09,97
So when I went in there. I want to know what was happening with. The people who were.

53
00:11:10,9 --> 00:11:19,96
And who gained independence for came here when because he was tied up with the environment.

54
00:11:20,13 --> 00:11:30,1
It was at a time when he was doing a university thing and it was very important for him to go so far away.

55
00:11:31,08 --> 00:11:36,66
So far eight which meant that I would be left alone in Kenya in Nairobi.

56
00:11:39,45 --> 00:11:46,67
I was given an introduction by a friend who lives here to the first secretary of the High Commission in Kenya.

57
00:11:48,99 --> 00:11:55,2
Cambridge and it turned out that Cambridge had married a person who had done some work for can't see.

58
00:11:55,24 --> 00:11:59,1
So I had a good beginning. I went down to the office.

59
00:12:00,69 --> 00:12:07,24
And the high commissioner himself over the discussion between myself.

60
00:12:08,36 --> 00:12:19,5
And he came out and he said Oh come on Mrs Farron. I'm so pleased to meet you. When can we have lunch. This was got.

61
00:12:20,06 --> 00:12:37,28
So I said. I'm not getting away from writing but I feel it. Time a fitting time to break. So I said I'm here.

62
00:12:37,3 --> 00:13:00,86
I would have lunch at the Intercontinental. And so this happened and it's beautiful. To see the president. Now.

63
00:13:02,29 --> 00:13:15,67
I had made it. Incidentally a couple of fellow strugglers here in Australia. And they came out for a peace. Congress.

64
00:13:15,96 --> 00:13:18,98
And interest. Anyhow.

65
00:13:21,57 --> 00:13:32,74
The next day came and went off tonight and he said from the dining room you could have the power to come here

66
00:13:33,55 --> 00:13:51,55
and we were into the wind. And the one hundred great. Sitting in the shade of the tree in the parks and I'm unemployed.

67
00:13:51,57 --> 00:14:13,57
After lunch back to my hotel. And it was a fear. Along the street and put your handbag in front. If you know you know.

68
00:14:14,53 --> 00:14:30,1
And he says are you. And he told me an Australian. Through It. The previous morning and she'd had her kidneys taken.

69
00:14:32,27 --> 00:14:41,34
I was very disappointed at what was happening in Kenya. The first secretary said a few nights later.

70
00:14:41,91 --> 00:14:44,44
I'll show you how people really live

71
00:14:45,5 --> 00:14:55,26
and they are about five kilometers from the city about two hundred thousand people living in a compound without

72
00:14:56,02 --> 00:15:11,83
and he said. Had the government come to power than the corruption. And I was very distant past. Anyhow. The phone rang.

73
00:15:12,12 --> 00:15:22,72
When I got back to the hotel. And said look the wife of the minister for trade.

74
00:15:23,24 --> 00:15:33,66
Is to visit Australia for a conference call. She's very very worried about.

75
00:15:33,68 --> 00:15:37,48
Has heard about the white house trailer and policy.

76
00:15:37,5 --> 00:15:47,21
And I said Well no but she's still worried and I wondered if you would take. With. Of course.

77
00:15:48,63 --> 00:16:01,1
He said well I will tell her so for someone to pick you up. So the next morning. I was called and that.

78
00:16:03,12 --> 00:16:20,14
The chauffeur had to show. Plus. The chauffeur with a big green. The driver and a security guard. To drive.

79
00:16:21,27 --> 00:16:37,4
God to take me to house. In front two policemen motorcyclists and. To protect me.

80
00:16:39,85 --> 00:16:59,01
But this was most of showing showing off you know. And here we go psycho police it's got to flee.

81
00:17:00,7 --> 00:17:11,85
I suppose because independence and independence and she was the wife of the Minister for Trade and I arrived

82
00:17:11,85 --> 00:17:30,01
and right around this White Castle. It's different cream and green and blue and black and red. When I walked.

83
00:17:30,02 --> 00:17:50,1
Into the welcome and began to ring the waiters came out. And you know. Take. Oh absolutely.

84
00:17:50,72 --> 00:18:09,65
So that night I had dinner with Kendra because I wanted he wanted. The House and he was one costume.

85
00:18:13,98 --> 00:18:28,49
And he said that woman. Before independence which wasn't going to think they had an independent. That woman.

86
00:18:29,86 --> 00:18:43,83
And one of the first things that happened she was from. This was a black nation.

87
00:18:43,85 --> 00:18:51,89
That had gained its freedom from color. Had a look at it and.

88
00:18:51,91 --> 00:19:10,81
When I felt I should tell you that I was said to left it out and I had the streets I wasn't afraid of him.

89
00:19:12,63 --> 00:19:22,36
It was just beautiful. The hotel I was staying with Mind you it was full of. Relics of color.

90
00:19:22,38 --> 00:20:11,82
And you know but one intruded. I'm not happy. This is happening and the very next to. Timely that they put to.

91
00:20:14,45 --> 00:20:19,82
The commission the country of the people.

92
00:20:21,27 --> 00:20:31,24
They detained a women's conference when I was there and there was sitting on a stage I.V.

93
00:20:31,25 --> 00:20:36,51
In the blue Mercedes Blue Cross.

94
00:20:36,53 --> 00:20:43,08
And there were a great great lineup of women who were working for the captain

95
00:20:43,08 --> 00:20:46,42
and the Prime Minister's Department all the various departments

96
00:20:47,8 --> 00:20:55,91
but there was also a great number of women who'd come from. One who stood up and before I could come.

97
00:20:55,93 --> 00:21:16,13
To sell a bunch of bananas and bread for my husband. Well. The women from the villages were very vocal. That polygamy.

98
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:26,66
Maybe legal. Now you know many of the women from the villages have said my husband left me with four children.

99
00:21:27,09 --> 00:21:35,52
He's gone with another woman other said you know he and his fourth wife in some cases they just have the children.

100
00:21:35,53 --> 00:21:38,1
So we want this illegal.

101
00:21:40,49 --> 00:21:51,3
When the motion was put woman employed by the captain was game enough to visit because I well I wouldn't be in a job

102
00:21:51,3 --> 00:22:01,13
the next day. Because Kenya has had three wives and I went with ministers who had. Polygamy.

103
00:22:02,98 --> 00:22:08,01
You know very serious problem for the women. Well.

104
00:22:08,02 --> 00:22:21,14
Before we went from there over to Tanzania and Kenya Rogers had tied at half with. High.

105
00:22:23,56 --> 00:22:35,55
Or ambassador in Africa which was to meet us at the airport at the airport after the plane and taken off

106
00:22:36,64 --> 00:22:39,9
and leave our house.

107
00:22:39,92 --> 00:22:51,78
One morning we've been friends with the first secretary and he had a wife who was involved in fact.

108
00:22:51,8 --> 00:22:59,55
In the campaign for the referendum. Down in Tasmania. So the doors were open which was marvelous and.

109
00:23:00,7 --> 00:23:08,62
Would you like to see where they lived and. So we hopped in the car and the.

110
00:23:09,55 --> 00:23:23,28
White House and the like and we will greeted housekeeper who looked after her. Because then I think.

111
00:23:23,99 --> 00:23:49,28
He was the one who married very. He was the one who married Rita Hayworth long before your time.

112
00:23:49,58 --> 00:24:04,52
Caroline tell you about the actress and so the housekeeper got rather friendly with me.

113
00:24:04,54 --> 00:24:16,68
Hair flowing blowing in the wind she don't mind if you other women also. Place. Anyhow. We can.

114
00:24:18,52 --> 00:24:42,28
And I said let's go to what was it before it was before independence. Doesn't matter. Forgotten what. You here pretty.

115
00:24:45,11 --> 00:25:04,05
Said your show. So I was talking with a friend who lives up to. This village and she said.

116
00:25:07,42 --> 00:25:13,84
It will be interesting and a couple of days later she rang and asked if she could come with me and her daughter.

117
00:25:14,22 --> 00:25:18,44
And this person had never been I don't think she'd ever been out of New South Wales.

118
00:25:19,69 --> 00:25:23,42
So I said Oh yes of course it was such and such.

119
00:25:26,74 --> 00:25:35,56
And then I had a ring from very different who was here last week for lunch for all our wedding anniversary.

120
00:25:36,85 --> 00:25:42,8
And she said Would you take my daughter. And her daughter. I think it.

121
00:25:45,91 --> 00:25:59,21
Economics and I said oh yes you know the sleeping bag will be pretty rough. So we all went off the four of us.

122
00:26:01,01 --> 00:26:19,81
We arrived it was a package deal put into the ground. After two days. I've got to find how to get to.

123
00:26:21,15 --> 00:26:38,65
This is the seventy's isn't it. What are we talking about that. Early seventy's.

124
00:26:38,67 --> 00:26:54,56
Carol and look for the priest to have missions all over the place. And the other two.

125
00:26:55,7 --> 00:26:58,56
Protestant missions around the place.

126
00:26:59,44 --> 00:27:12,65
And I said well I'll go down to shop around the place to find a tiny little island didn't have a.

127
00:27:13,03 --> 00:27:52,59
Strip you could only go by. And we're all come back here after lunch we found out. I've often seen you coming in. With..

128
00:27:47,18 --> 00:27:57,41
The Federal Member for T.I.A. And sometimes. How things caring.

129
00:27:57,71 --> 00:28:09,22
And I said all very well I'm just trying to find out if the might be a little trading off to them for he said he made a

130
00:28:09,22 --> 00:28:16,4
phone call and he said get down to the bank. And there I think it was the manager and.

131
00:28:16,83 --> 00:28:24,46
He's going to try to they're going to hammer him tomorrow. So. He was waiting for me.

132
00:28:26,16 --> 00:28:36,62
He said How many of you and I said oh five. He said. All right well it'll cost you dollars. That is called the From.

133
00:28:37,16 --> 00:28:54,03
And it will lead from such and such to eight o'clock tonight. OK I'll go back and tele other stuff and go off to use.

134
00:28:54,92 --> 00:29:09,32
And she wasn't quite sure what she was going to take in the case of beautiful. Great looking face.

135
00:29:09,87 --> 00:29:15,91
She had these lovely. Paints which she would have made.

136
00:29:18,23 --> 00:29:26,98
So I go back and tell them what if you got letters going to the place because we go back and write.

137
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:32,51
And the Presbyterian says no we're not going near it because you're all just as bad. You're going to do this.

138
00:29:32,55 --> 00:29:44,48
I think you'll say What an awful lot we are getting tonight. So you've got to pack and get a taxi. Right.

139
00:29:46,14 --> 00:30:09,67
And we'll meet here. In the fall here and. Beautiful. Simple but. A big suitcase.

140
00:30:10,82 --> 00:30:25,92
And they have to have a six and sleeping bag. So I looked over and she's a beautiful person with a great sense if you.

141
00:30:27,2 --> 00:30:41,96
And her daughter looked at her. When the taxis are right for her to Texas. We're down to the boat and they.

142
00:30:44,3 --> 00:31:07,03
Say twenty meters thirty meters little. Rust. Dripping water started and it was. And there were men.

143
00:31:08,72 --> 00:31:19,93
And every inch of space appear to be taken and the man who owned it. And he says come on.

144
00:31:23,97 --> 00:31:31,64
And there was a little space on a day that my bottom could be seen and gave no consideration to the others

145
00:31:31,64 --> 00:31:37,93
and I just about it in the bag. Yeah.
