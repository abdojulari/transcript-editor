1
00:00:06,48 --> 00:00:11,52
I did for cation this is session fifteen with faith bender

2
00:00:12,23 --> 00:00:17,93
and Karen Craig recorded in Sydney on Wednesday the first of October one thousand nine hundred ninety seven

3
00:00:17,93 --> 00:00:19,6
and tape starts in a few seconds.

4
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:39,9
I thought I should record a few of the things I want to remember one was the day that I had the radio on to set a time

5
00:00:39,9 --> 00:00:47,87
when I listened to Parliament every day it was broadcast mainly because it was worth listening to.

6
00:00:49,89 --> 00:01:05,2
And I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I just couldn't and the government was being sect and I sat through.

7
00:01:07,06 --> 00:01:19,16
In the middle of November the beginning of. Nine hundred seventy five. So I want to remember to write about that.

8
00:01:20,35 --> 00:01:21,07
And the effect that.

9
00:01:21,75 --> 00:01:37,86
Not on me personally it had an effect on make me of course because I thought of democracy is all about in this country.

10
00:01:37,88 --> 00:01:48,47
You know I've got a very suspicious man when it comes to politics and I felt that the CIA were in for that very minute.

11
00:01:48,48 --> 00:02:00,75
Because we had pool. Had pulled the troops out of. The prison doors were open on the conscripts came out.

12
00:02:04,53 --> 00:02:10,99
If I could just go back to the night with them was elected and we had a whole crowd of people here.

13
00:02:11,2 --> 00:02:18,68
They were a freeway they were down the back Malone they were in the picture room and we had extra television sets

14
00:02:19,73 --> 00:02:28,09
and masses of grog because we were so sure that would lead and.

15
00:02:28,11 --> 00:02:37,64
The people just went ahead and I recall a friend of mine. Who was here that night and Paula had to say University.

16
00:02:39,54 --> 00:02:48,85
One could have been called. And the tears came to her and she said Michael.

17
00:02:51,54 --> 00:03:00,77
You know it was just quite amazing the tremendous impact it had on a house because we've gone.

18
00:03:00,79 --> 00:03:11,09
We were sick and fed up to the teeth of demonstrating against the involvement we had in war and now we come to power.

19
00:03:11,6 --> 00:03:15,27
And it was all over him. It was hard to believe. It.

20
00:03:17,27 --> 00:03:35,54
Well I want to remember that and then I also remember another incident. We packed up. And went to London. And.

21
00:03:36,98 --> 00:03:51,28
Because he had to go to Tokyo. So he went to Turkey. And the lawn and I travelled later in joined him in London.

22
00:03:52,55 --> 00:04:02,04
And we had Christmas dinner with the other panelists in London. I wasn't awfully happy about that because we.

23
00:04:03,6 --> 00:04:10,57
To celebrate Christmas we didn't celebrated we didn't believe in giving presents

24
00:04:10,57 --> 00:04:12,95
and all that because we didn't know what it was all about

25
00:04:14,81 --> 00:04:23,28
and he were tied up with relations who placed tremendous effort. Making sure everyone had a president and all that.

26
00:04:25,77 --> 00:04:34,24
Even to this day I find it grinding. Because it's so meaningless. Why does it all of it.

27
00:04:35,33 --> 00:04:51,53
And that's how I've always felt any. We went over to London. And I think. Oh that's right.

28
00:04:51,79 --> 00:04:56,54
We stayed in Bloomsbury hotel.

29
00:04:56,55 --> 00:05:04,87
And it was a very hotel that I had stayed in and not in fifty one and the beginning that nine hundred fifty two.

30
00:05:05,16 --> 00:05:21,97
Was nice. Anyhow. Then we decided to go over to Vienna. And we went and spent some time. First in Amsterdam and Paris.

31
00:05:21,99 --> 00:05:33,02
Oh that was a wonderful holiday in Paris absolutely marvelous. You know it's a mass romantic city in the world.

32
00:05:33,3 --> 00:05:47,02
I'm sure even in the bitter cold and the sleet and drink coffee but we had great big coats big full coats and gloves

33
00:05:47,83 --> 00:05:51,79
and they were going to be here now where it was three degrees.

34
00:05:51,8 --> 00:05:53,73
And we stayed in a pinch you know in there

35
00:05:54,64 --> 00:06:02,23
and we had a good friendship with those people each time I went back to the and I After that we stayed in the same.

36
00:06:02,3 --> 00:06:14,21
Place but. Had relations. Who were bloody good Nazis. When he was taken off to.

37
00:06:14,84 --> 00:06:20,35
In nineteen thirty nine when the Germans in Austria.

38
00:06:22,27 --> 00:06:26,59
Because the Austrians turned out to be better Nazi Germany Germans did

39
00:06:26,59 --> 00:06:34,21
and they couldn't persecute the Jews quickly enough. Once the Germans moved in.

40
00:06:34,34 --> 00:06:37,04
You could have it used to get down in the streets

41
00:06:37,04 --> 00:06:44,03
and scrub the streets the Austrians went into the universities to pick that used up and threw them out of the wind

42
00:06:46,67 --> 00:06:58,13
and hunt was arrested and taken to a concentration camp he had relations. Brianna. Who said that they wanted to use.

43
00:06:58,14 --> 00:07:02,74
While a father was at them our house or being vice versa. I'm quite sure.

44
00:07:03,01 --> 00:07:10,88
And they certainly kept their distance from hundreds. And I think one of us actually in the German army.

45
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:18,42
After all those years. We had they were full of guilt. They did nothing about it.

46
00:07:18,54 --> 00:07:27,88
He was into concentration camp they did nothing to get him out. So if you fall again over backwards to.

47
00:07:27,9 --> 00:07:58,55
And to Tallahassee and. So we've had Christmas in London. And we spent New Year's Eve in Paris.

48
00:07:59,5 --> 00:08:05,45
And I really must tell you the bit.

49
00:08:06,81 --> 00:08:12,19
We arrived in the afternoon we had a rest and they said We decided we'd go out to dinner.

50
00:08:13,71 --> 00:08:23,78
So we went out to someone in London told us that office at the pub we were staying in. Was a very little restaurant.

51
00:08:24,61 --> 00:08:28,9
So we walked a few blocks and family way came back and we said I think.

52
00:08:29,48 --> 00:08:36,73
We have to look at the bad they would had some grog. And there was a black voter with the main your pets.

53
00:08:36,74 --> 00:08:56,98
And the price. So I look at the menu. I say it's it would only be something like ten dollars each for a forgotten.

54
00:08:57,26 --> 00:09:03,02
It's just I've just forgotten but anyhow or so we thought about his and food in Paris.

55
00:09:03,29 --> 00:09:17,48
So we go back and we freshen up a basin where welcomed at the door and. Lovely table such to me I have never in.

56
00:09:19,35 --> 00:09:42,25
Perfection. Right. And what's a very special quite a big face and the face and head feel in our face.

57
00:09:42,76 --> 00:09:54,24
And then came the cheese a huge platter of. Whole cheeses and the wine flat we were getting pretty early and.

58
00:09:56,39 --> 00:10:04,25
Now I was thinking if it wasn't so cheap pop one of those cheeses in my handbag photo morrow.

59
00:10:04,73 --> 00:10:15,91
And just picked the bread up in the market. You know that not worth that cheap. And I did.

60
00:10:17,11 --> 00:10:27,73
Pay this you know covered in chocolate covered with cream and all that and coffee with brandy to follow.

61
00:10:27,74 --> 00:10:37,05
Well no they didn't we were pretty early. So around about midnight we asked for the bill.

62
00:10:37,07 --> 00:10:45,91
I put the comma in the wrong place. I looked at the black book and it was one hundred thirty dollars. Each for forty.

63
00:10:46,42 --> 00:10:52,42
Here. So I thought of what am I going to do. And how.

64
00:10:53,77 --> 00:11:03,73
This is how he's got no Martin or bad money he says don't worry I've got to travel. I'm an American travelers.

65
00:11:04,48 --> 00:11:10,18
And our super who will cross the Red Cross Street and get it so I sit here in Gaza.

66
00:11:10,37 --> 00:11:14,86
You know what I had to look you know and he came back and I said What's it with Holmes.

67
00:11:15,04 --> 00:11:24,16
He says with fifteen dollars and I said and I saw both of us more show you up for the rest of the night. Well.

68
00:11:26,15 --> 00:11:37,31
I was traveling with Swiss francs traveler's checks. So when the way to our SIT look. Will you take Swiss francs.

69
00:11:38,76 --> 00:11:46,93
He could not speak English. And we battled through with. His English came go to.

70
00:11:47,91 --> 00:12:06,33
So you met him that is no trouble at all. Would you like to come into the office and. If. We had a really crazy.

71
00:12:06,87 --> 00:12:19,3
They knew you went over to Vietnam and I do want to record this because. I just come back to this. And hear the.

72
00:12:19,32 --> 00:12:29,74
Two questions. And they've grown up children in their thirty's and children. And then another.

73
00:12:29,76 --> 00:12:38,48
Distant or another cousin or. And they were all full of excuses you know. Or of course you know.

74
00:12:38,5 --> 00:12:47,15
We had to respect the two women. And I felt very uncomfortable when they these people.

75
00:12:48,35 --> 00:12:52,41
And lean on my secret after distaste.

76
00:12:53,49 --> 00:13:04,04
But they you know cut off from the rest of the world theory you knew were very limited. They're not great travel.

77
00:13:04,65 --> 00:13:08,8
They may be now a bit but not awfully plain.

78
00:13:08,81 --> 00:13:16,81
And there was no other city in the world as far as they were concerned and. So you know we said to each other look.

79
00:13:21,14 --> 00:13:23,29
Here's something which we did twice.

80
00:13:23,88 --> 00:13:37,98
And so forth but they kept insisting on reading up and then we have cousins who were right. Well you know.

81
00:13:39,24 --> 00:13:52,78
Full of guilt. Running up and said You must come. We want to have a be identified. To welcome you. Wow. Thanks.

82
00:13:52,78 --> 00:14:04,35
Sandy power. And when I say to lean on them. You've got a long trace put it down. Oh I'm not coming. Where I went.

83
00:14:04,93 --> 00:14:16,37
Those days in the seventy's were wearing those wonderful long and I had a great long skirt and a red jacket

84
00:14:16,37 --> 00:14:32,24
and hence had a blue suit. We did. Well you're wrong. I think. They were coming in. Women. With long black. Long white.

85
00:14:32,26 --> 00:14:41,19
Yes and. In a private. This is a strange.

86
00:14:41,74 --> 00:14:48,46
So music is playing the Blue Danube but if they played it once I played it a thousand times.

87
00:14:48,48 --> 00:14:53,12
And there's there was a ballroom downstairs. So good and well all day.

88
00:14:55,05 --> 00:15:02,98
There was something extremely unpleasant about it. It's hard for me to tell you that. It left a bad taste in my mouth.

89
00:15:04,4 --> 00:15:12,71
And I was falling over backwards to do things for Homs. And Iran and so I think with that happened.

90
00:15:13,61 --> 00:15:22,98
We couldn't we were snowed in. So we had to stay till seven o'clock in the morning.

91
00:15:22,99 --> 00:15:32,03
The people that I'm still not through yet. Oh yes. Like to throw that another year. Absolutely absolutely.

92
00:15:33,67 --> 00:15:42,28
So the next festival was about to start about a week after that insult.

93
00:15:42,76 --> 00:15:48,03
And you know when you think of that poor man die. And.

94
00:15:49,71 --> 00:15:57,57
There is the tray at the mouth of the Mozart express every for the Thomas full of Mozart chocolates.

95
00:15:58,06 --> 00:16:04,23
Mozart on the legs so much they live so long I wanted to go over and hear a concert

96
00:16:04,95 --> 00:16:08,48
and Ham said to one have his relations.

97
00:16:09,29 --> 00:16:18,3
So the next thing we have a telephone call from Salzburg from the upper stinkingly rich horrible Nazi.

98
00:16:19,61 --> 00:16:32,78
Well she will stay with us. She says Oh I poked into these hostel. So. They didn't trouble us after that.

99
00:16:33,05 --> 00:16:37,31
But it was a very interesting visit to that point.

100
00:16:37,86 --> 00:16:46,33
It was the only time I'd ever had any contact with hamsters for elections and it was.

101
00:16:46,35 --> 00:16:58,43
Good to stand back and watch their very peculiar behavior. They'd lined up beautifully with the Nazis. Yes.

102
00:16:59,18 --> 00:17:09,91
Anyhow I want to just move on a little if I might and say that. On one occasion.

103
00:17:09,92 --> 00:17:17,33
And this is I have to lean on and Stephen Moore marry him.

104
00:17:18,55 --> 00:17:30,23
To England and we think about staying for a while and usually. So we're coming. And. Let's get a cottage.

105
00:17:33,78 --> 00:17:41,39
So she organized. We stayed at a little village. We went from London to Vienna where we picked up a couple.

106
00:17:41,78 --> 00:17:45,7
And went from they had her over to Florence and this was about.

107
00:17:47,02 --> 00:18:02,33
Forty miles out from Florence Baca I just forgotten the title of the. Really. Doesn't matter but it was.

108
00:18:04,93 --> 00:18:16,18
And we had one poor. The servants' quarters to the castle. Which was opposite. There was a rough road.

109
00:18:16,2 --> 00:18:20,24
And they have your original Castle which was built in the fourteenth century

110
00:18:21,07 --> 00:18:24,65
and the Count who had practically the whole of the mountain.

111
00:18:25,23 --> 00:18:35,3
And opposite where the servants' quarters which he was slated for. What we post what we rented it was magnificent.

112
00:18:37,73 --> 00:18:49,87
To abstain bedrooms but the plainest of Tuscany. And still only original kitchen you know here and.

113
00:18:49,89 --> 00:19:03,64
When we arrived during the face of the Phoenix. And the figs were only a small orange and green. And I was looking.

114
00:19:05,53 --> 00:19:15,47
In the atlas to try and find the place fig leaf. It's called That was the village but no we were up on the top.

115
00:19:16,86 --> 00:19:21,53
But the neighbors came including the count and say.

116
00:19:22,82 --> 00:19:33,13
Well the we'll have a festival and some food and dancing in lineage. It's very welcome. I make the local people so.

117
00:19:36,83 --> 00:19:43,73
It was just so lovely. So we said yes we'd go down but it so happened. That.

118
00:19:47,02 --> 00:19:56,46
I mean the mayor of Florence who was out as a guest and it was a communist Council. And I brought to this town.

119
00:19:56,59 --> 00:20:05,78
Usually you know. And they turned it on and. Cheek wonderful pestis.

120
00:20:05,84 --> 00:20:17,64
And a band and we still have danced out in the square here. So then no one was much.

121
00:20:17,66 --> 00:20:23,43
But we didn't and we picked up a couple of bottles and took them out. So the next afternoon.

122
00:20:23,61 --> 00:20:36,31
We were sitting outside in the courtyard. Drinking the wine and the Count came over to ask us if we'd like to go.

123
00:20:37,64 --> 00:20:42,07
To have a drink with him and we said oh no you must you know it's we.

124
00:20:42,4 --> 00:20:46,57
We pick someone up down at the very moment when you have a glass

125
00:20:46,57 --> 00:20:56,81
and he looked at the bottle he said I don't usually have one quite so true for you Do you want to go.

126
00:20:57,43 --> 00:21:03,1
And he happened to be. He happened to be an exporter of why.

127
00:21:03,12 --> 00:21:15,27
He had a right sellers and huge invasion yards and he exported into a place that it was again so we sat there

128
00:21:15,27 --> 00:21:27,7
and he looked at the label and he said Oh it's a little early for me I think so.

129
00:21:28,89 --> 00:21:36,14
That was one of the missed enjoyable experience is staying up there in the. In Tuscany.

130
00:21:37,33 --> 00:21:47,82
I wanted to put that on because. I should never forget the fun we had on the film. And the hospitality. Well.

131
00:21:48,22 --> 00:21:53,95
If all you've often spoken about in the course of these recordings your love of Italy.

132
00:21:54,98 --> 00:22:04,63
And we went down to we left a little arm and Stephen there. And then I got a train to Rome for her. We could.

133
00:22:04,65 --> 00:22:15,82
And he could never get me away from her. After that but it's strange to us you know and I have met.

134
00:22:18,17 --> 00:22:29,83
It's like I could see it coming and. I thought about it and I thought well. It's not quite what I want to do.

135
00:22:31,24 --> 00:22:37,46
When I travel the world so many tourists but now.

136
00:22:37,92 --> 00:22:50,57
You go to the airport and it's almost impossible it's horrible horrible. So pleased that I did it before it became or.

137
00:22:50,59 --> 00:22:55,93
Now I just want to say I want to remember that for the eighty in particular.

138
00:22:57,31 --> 00:23:05,51
And I also want to deal in great detail when I'm actually getting the book together of my experiences with.

139
00:23:05,53 --> 00:23:14,62
The Housing Commission in greater detail. And the foundation.

140
00:23:14,63 --> 00:23:19,96
And I have that's all very well documented so that when people problem.

141
00:23:22,55 --> 00:23:29,04
And if we just go into the ninety's you know why the ninety's have been very peaceful.

142
00:23:30,76 --> 00:23:48,21
It's been now it's just being at home and. I'm tormented quite by television channels which are right. Right.

143
00:23:48,27 --> 00:23:50,41
Yeah I don't like that.

144
00:23:51,44 --> 00:24:03,07
I kind of feel I've had my front and these days I just want to I want to because I enjoy it but sliced.

145
00:24:06,05 --> 00:24:12,56
Just like to say something about how you're feeling about after the big reconciliation Convention

146
00:24:12,56 --> 00:24:20,18
and all those demands on your time and you know the celebration of the one nine hundred sixty seven referendum

147
00:24:20,18 --> 00:24:34,21
but how you're feeling now about the future here Indigenous people are I'm very hopeful. That.

148
00:24:34,22 --> 00:24:45,13
As far as the Aboriginal people are concerned. Been rough but they will get there. And there is one thing I know.

149
00:24:45,15 --> 00:24:49,21
That they will never give up their fight for their right to the land.

150
00:24:49,23 --> 00:25:15,3
Now they're going to know about the reconciliation contention. Was one of the great experiences. It was a time to.

151
00:25:15,32 --> 00:25:32,1
And it was a time to make a man. There was a lot of warmth in that place. I'm sure that everyone who when they felt.

152
00:25:32,12 --> 00:25:41,56
That there was a renewing of the Spirit as it were. I didn't want to come back and be active.

153
00:25:43,8 --> 00:25:54,89
For me it was like closing a chapter. And somehow I felt I could close the chapter and say.

154
00:25:56,89 --> 00:26:04,95
All right now as far as I'm concerned. I know that the battle the work battle the battle for the week.

155
00:26:05,66 --> 00:26:18,06
Is going to be difficult. But I know. That there are a foul out there. Hundreds of us.

156
00:26:18,08 --> 00:26:33,69
Who see the injustice of the ten point plan of how. And I truly believe that the embers. Have far more on this.

157
00:26:36,02 --> 00:26:45,15
And I fully realize.

158
00:26:46,09 --> 00:27:00,15
The convention was like the chapter in my life as it were happening and I had seen the anger in the deuce trace

159
00:27:01,09 --> 00:27:17,44
and the disappointment. But then that coming together. Was very positive and there's a groundswell today.

160
00:27:17,45 --> 00:27:20,57
And I think we'll leave it.
