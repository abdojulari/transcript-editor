1
00:00:04,57 --> 00:00:09,92
Did you get a job after you got
laid off a tall man long to do such

2
00:00:09,92 --> 00:00:16,56
a job went back to you married
in those days while i was

3
00:00:16,56 --> 00:00:23,32
working on the bridge 1930. And did
your mates give you anything of as

4
00:00:23,32 --> 00:00:30,27
a memento that no because
it was very quiet say i

5
00:00:30,27 --> 00:00:34,68
was out here. I got no relations after

6
00:00:34,68 --> 00:00:39,09
a year. And the wife was
the same move she had was

7
00:00:39,09 --> 00:00:45,66
a proud. And it was
married. No sidney. But

8
00:00:45,67 --> 00:00:51,35
church. Some pages church you know sydney

9
00:00:54,50 --> 00:00:59,64
. Can you tell me do you remember what
you are where were you when the arch was

10
00:00:59,64 --> 00:01:06,14
joined in the workshop when the arch which
still end. And it was in the morning.

11
00:01:06,66 --> 00:01:13,37
And of course we got the tie
off. I think it was about

12
00:01:14,64 --> 00:01:20,53
between ten eleven at the moon. And as
we all march out we got percent it was

13
00:01:20,53 --> 00:01:21,84
a campaign to show

14
00:01:21,84 --> 00:01:28,82
a little bit. And somebody couldn't
say oh it's got permission

15
00:01:28,82 --> 00:01:34,13
from somewhere to at king's head on. Of

16
00:01:35,49 --> 00:01:42,33
and it lock into the sydney harbour bridge.
I think that was david i know some of

17
00:01:42,33 --> 00:01:46,35
the like. Well who had it done. It may have
been i wouldn't say for sure who it was

18
00:01:46,35 --> 00:01:51,93
but i know i cut my daughter's got to
show them but still and she prices.

19
00:01:53,79 --> 00:01:57,95
Believe some of them got sovereigns the
ones that were up there on the table

20
00:01:57,95 --> 00:02:03,59
slackening they made and i couldn't tell.
I don't didn't know too much about the

21
00:02:03,59 --> 00:02:09,67
outside work at all although we
tried to get out at the top and

22
00:02:11,05 --> 00:02:13,51
there was no put up that there's

23
00:02:13,51 --> 00:02:20,39
a bounce to staff and workers
be instant dismissal

24
00:02:20,39 --> 00:02:27,18
left climbing up. Did you
climb up there. I had me

25
00:02:27,18 --> 00:02:34,14
arf way up went up the top.
And that was bad enough for

26
00:02:34,15 --> 00:02:40,74
out when you look down. But then the

27
00:02:40,75 --> 00:02:47,66
first i think that went under the
arch was the new holland attached

28
00:02:48,86 --> 00:02:55,34
. That was the first boat that when under
the arch. Do you remember any of the

29
00:02:55,34 --> 00:03:02,31
other work when you work with out of the
workshop. Thompson and joe thompson

30
00:03:02,31 --> 00:03:07,45
to private and the piper riveter

31
00:03:08,99 --> 00:03:15,76
and three is so long that
you forget their names and

32
00:03:17,01 --> 00:03:23,96
did which did you have anything to do
with any of the bosses know i know

33
00:03:23,96 --> 00:03:29,50
this about us and of whose
phone and what wilson

34
00:03:30,95 --> 00:03:36,83
said i think was another part and that
if you'd and you were left alone you

35
00:03:36,83 --> 00:03:43,25
interfered and that. How long did you
go for lunch breaks. Oh yeah nigga

36
00:03:44,71 --> 00:03:51,25
and that nourished alone for lunch. I
say i only lived just across from the

37
00:03:53,40 --> 00:03:54,33
shop out

38
00:03:54,33 --> 00:04:00,81
a back door just in the cone
and sam. Do you remember

39
00:04:03,43 --> 00:04:05,40
any of the well you see of
course you wouldn't room with

40
00:04:05,40 --> 00:04:11,35
a lunch. Therefore do you remember any
of the opening of the bridge. Yes up and

41
00:04:11,35 --> 00:04:16,95
down. Certainly for the open end of the
bridge and that took crushed and that

42
00:04:19,28 --> 00:04:26,14
little boys. Yes we had it good down
there. Do you remember how much you got

43
00:04:26,14 --> 00:04:32,97
paid while you were on the bridge. Now
i could tell you that no i couldn't

44
00:04:32,97 --> 00:04:38,54
tell you were you didn't get any hope money
anywhere because you're in the workshop

45
00:04:38,54 --> 00:04:43,45
. Now we don't know how to manual
danger money or anything that stays.
