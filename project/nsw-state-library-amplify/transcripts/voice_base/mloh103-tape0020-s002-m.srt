1
00:00:15,38 --> 00:00:20,33
Oh i think if. People have no more.

2
00:00:21,65 --> 00:00:24,57
Nothing more income and wanting
to live in the country

3
00:00:25,82 --> 00:00:27,31
and they don't even from the start.

4
00:00:27,53 --> 00:00:31,20
Won't you know think oh yes these are
the people i want to live with but just

5
00:00:31,20 --> 00:00:33,31
that they all come together
if economic reasons

6
00:00:33,31 --> 00:00:37,93
that it's quite stunning if they
succeed and can overcome the conflict

7
00:00:37,93 --> 00:00:44,05
and find the motivation to solve problems
without i think i think we were at it

8
00:00:44,05 --> 00:00:49,94
made it really easy for ourselves to have
a sort of spiritually based you know

9
00:00:49,94 --> 00:00:51,15
century that we had in common.

10
00:00:52,62 --> 00:00:52,77
I think

11
00:00:52,77 --> 00:01:04,00
that was really important.

12
00:01:04,02 --> 00:01:06,75
Well economically.

13
00:01:06,77 --> 00:01:13,21
Or are not self-sustaining in any sense
and in fact from the beginning we never.

14
00:01:14,32 --> 00:01:19,38
Made any claims that that's what we
wanted to do anything so we haven't had

15
00:01:19,38 --> 00:01:23,28
that sort of ideal to live up to.

16
00:01:23,29 --> 00:01:29,70
Economically i don't think communities are
viable the whole society works against

17
00:01:29,70 --> 00:01:35,17
it and some people in fact more and
the fact that here the days are gone

18
00:01:35,17 --> 00:01:39,42
when everybody was home every day doing
things on the farm because we're not any

19
00:01:39,42 --> 00:01:42,79
more just about everybody's got
a job. People are studying.

20
00:01:44,27 --> 00:01:48,36
Some days there would only be
a couple of people at home

21
00:01:49,40 --> 00:01:53,26
and you know you could easily say i wasn't
that sad they're not together anymore

22
00:01:53,26 --> 00:01:59,26
but. Again you know your needs
a new interests change and.

23
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,52
On most of us here at
the time and our lives

24
00:02:02,52 --> 00:02:08,87
and we really want to be mixing it up in
the wider community so via i don't know

25
00:02:08,87 --> 00:02:10,92
if this place is viable

26
00:02:10,92 --> 00:02:17,35
but it shouldn't be by any sort of standards
you know it just it just i think works

27
00:02:17,35 --> 00:02:27,80
in spite of in spite of the
forces around it somehow.

28
00:02:28,57 --> 00:02:30,18
Yes absolutely absolutely.

29
00:02:31,83 --> 00:02:37,32
There's some people here who never would
be on the job but most of us were.

30
00:02:37,98 --> 00:02:42,60
And of course at that time
it was very easy to be.

31
00:02:43,69 --> 00:02:49,62
A couple years after we were here we were
quite effective by a man named stephen

32
00:02:49,62 --> 00:02:54,66
gaskin who was the leader of the farm in
tennessee and came to the nimbin area

33
00:02:54,66 --> 00:03:00,31
and talked with lots of
people around and we at

34
00:03:00,31 --> 00:03:02,48
that time body farm
discussed how could we.

35
00:03:02,53 --> 00:03:06,15
No one share our income totally
did we want to do that

36
00:03:06,15 --> 00:03:12,25
and could we create our own livelihood
so that we could get off the dole.

37
00:03:12,26 --> 00:03:14,78
Some of us did my partner

38
00:03:14,78 --> 00:03:18,99
and i started a business which
supported us for five years

39
00:03:18,99 --> 00:03:24,39
and also employed other people
on the farm but we were never

40
00:03:25,27 --> 00:03:27,27
that tight a group that we could all agree

41
00:03:27,27 --> 00:03:31,35
or people were willing to put aside
their own interests and say oh yes. Ok.

42
00:03:31,43 --> 00:03:35,16
Well here's an income generating thing i'm
going to forget about what i want to do

43
00:03:35,16 --> 00:03:37,57
and do this that just never worked

44
00:03:38,53 --> 00:03:42,81
and yeah so the welfare state of course
in many ways made this possible.

45
00:03:43,97 --> 00:03:51,63
Sure.

46
00:03:56,30 --> 00:03:59,95
Yeah yeah yeah well taran you create.

47
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,77
It was a tremendous thing for
us and lots of other people.

48
00:04:05,26 --> 00:04:06,27
And i person at the time.

49
00:04:06,32 --> 00:04:10,07
John see the chris is now a
globetrotter further and for us

50
00:04:11,89 --> 00:04:15,79
and there's lots of other
people who have very strong.

51
00:04:16,92 --> 00:04:17,41
Leanings and

52
00:04:17,41 --> 00:04:22,18
that way there's two people who live here
now who work very hard for the range

53
00:04:22,18 --> 00:04:25,08
first information center.

54
00:04:25,82 --> 00:04:32,25
And we've supported lots of projects to
do with fighting against sand mining

55
00:04:32,25 --> 00:04:35,95
and deforestation all kinds of things like

56
00:04:35,95 --> 00:04:39,74
that so question it's a very
very strong value that we hold

57
00:04:40,74 --> 00:04:45,41
and sometimes sometimes i think about the
wider community in general like you know

58
00:04:45,41 --> 00:04:48,01
nimbin if mullumbimby everywhere

59
00:04:48,01 --> 00:04:53,40
that maybe we're just pawns in
the trees hands and all that all

60
00:04:53,40 --> 00:04:57,80
that really matters about what about
coming here and living in this area is

61
00:04:57,80 --> 00:05:01,52
that in some way. That the trees
are got a chance to grow.

62
00:05:01,77 --> 00:05:05,02
Well they're in our
possession. That's a fantasy.

63
00:05:05,05 --> 00:05:08,07
I've had that if we do nothing
else. That's fantastic.

64
00:05:14,39 --> 00:05:20,32
People. Yeah yeah.

65
00:05:21,48 --> 00:05:25,48
Just about the whole farm ended up
down at the touraine you creat camp

66
00:05:26,21 --> 00:05:31,52
and we'd already had a bit of you
know practice in organizing ourselves

67
00:05:31,52 --> 00:05:36,43
and like diff some people guarding ball
who were running the first aid sort of

68
00:05:36,43 --> 00:05:40,54
organisation down there and
others were under communications.

69
00:05:42,29 --> 00:05:42,56
And that

70
00:05:43,40 --> 00:05:48,06
that interest bit stayed very strong
several people went down to the franklin

71
00:05:48,06 --> 00:05:53,85
and also took on responsible jobs in
helping that movement. Do the job.

72
00:05:53,85 --> 00:05:54,47
It had to do

73
00:05:55,32 --> 00:05:59,74
and then years later there was the fight
for the nightcap national for us to and.

74
00:06:00,86 --> 00:06:07,84
And again i mean like there was
a big bamboo aerial pole of my

75
00:06:07,84 --> 00:06:08,95
veranda c.b.

76
00:06:08,95 --> 00:06:13,89
Radio going all the time from nobody listening
you know this is black stumper it is

77
00:06:13,89 --> 00:06:17,01
so and so and and.

78
00:06:17,92 --> 00:06:22,22
It's always been a really good feeling
for people here to get involved.

79
00:06:22,57 --> 00:06:27,26
You know to lend a hand and become involved
in these things and jancee left here.

80
00:06:28,61 --> 00:06:31,43
Oh about nine years ago.
That's left the farm.

81
00:06:31,89 --> 00:06:37,77
But we really support what he does

82
00:06:37,77 --> 00:06:41,49
and i welcome him back whenever
he comes back to australia

83
00:06:42,53 --> 00:06:46,57
and he gets a lot of support moral
support from the people here

84
00:06:52,38 --> 00:06:56,67
so.

85
00:06:59,83 --> 00:07:02,67
Yeah well green and also other things too.

86
00:07:02,70 --> 00:07:09,45
I mean there's a couple
of people like that.

87
00:07:14,92 --> 00:07:21,30
I guess that we see. Spiritual inquiry.

88
00:07:21,32 --> 00:07:24,92
As all all those things as
having to do with greenness

89
00:07:24,92 --> 00:07:31,31
and with multiculturalism and so on.

90
00:07:31,39 --> 00:07:37,42
I mean. It's not the first time but as
porton as the environmental is and is to us.

91
00:07:37,44 --> 00:07:41,89
I think also the question of native
native peoples is important to us.

92
00:07:45,20 --> 00:07:51,77
Education on all levels we see is part
is that people are involved in primary

93
00:07:51,77 --> 00:07:54,48
and to syria dictation here

94
00:07:54,48 --> 00:07:59,96
and things like we have we have two guys
here who are very very much into men.

95
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:00,50
The men's issues

96
00:08:01,70 --> 00:08:08,15
and really like organizing groups of men
to talk about where their place in the

97
00:08:08,15 --> 00:08:13,62
scheme of things in it is so. Yes.

98
00:08:13,65 --> 00:08:20,37
Earnest our idea about what's worth well
spiritual pursuit is very very broad

99
00:08:22,12 --> 00:08:27,31
i mean there's also a prison here who's
actually leading retreats now from cells so

100
00:08:28,07 --> 00:08:31,28
there's the whole gamut
other people who feel

101
00:08:31,28 --> 00:08:34,45
that a very good way of
inquiries to occur counselling

102
00:08:34,45 --> 00:08:39,40
and run co-counsel in groups
is a which is a very gallantry

103
00:08:39,40 --> 00:08:44,81
and type way of working through one's issues
which doesn't involve paying someone a

104
00:08:44,81 --> 00:08:49,60
lot of money.

105
00:08:50,79 --> 00:08:54,49
And we sort of keep planting trees.

106
00:08:55,63 --> 00:09:01,13
Which is where that question
started is really important but.

107
00:09:01,15 --> 00:09:04,96
Just it when your kids grow up and.

108
00:09:05,70 --> 00:09:10,71
I guess we just see it as getting brought
you know what's important is broader

109
00:09:10,71 --> 00:09:16,94
and broader all the time. We can hold.

110
00:09:19,25 --> 00:09:23,75
Well it's absolutely
wonderful place. I don't.

111
00:09:24,03 --> 00:09:28,76
I often wonder what the kids will
say you know when someone asks them

112
00:09:28,76 --> 00:09:33,45
when they're 25 to see how they felt
about it but it's a safe place.

113
00:09:35,09 --> 00:09:41,36
We've got 20 kids around 20 kids
in the place from 15 years down to

114
00:09:42,46 --> 00:09:44,79
four months and.

115
00:09:45,71 --> 00:09:50,39
A lot of those kids who put on up together
which i think is a wonderful thing

116
00:09:50,39 --> 00:09:55,65
and will be really important will
be important in their lives.

117
00:09:55,67 --> 00:09:59,87
I've always been quite amazed
that. Most of our key.

118
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,45
You've don't go bush actually don't
go exploring in the bush much.

119
00:10:06,47 --> 00:10:07,09
I don't know why.

120
00:10:09,26 --> 00:10:18,30
But they're sure have a good
time together here like

121
00:10:19,06 --> 00:10:24,96
that. And. Anderson.

122
00:10:25,64 --> 00:10:27,30
Anderson yeah.

123
00:10:27,32 --> 00:10:29,24
Andy is i mean

124
00:10:29,93 --> 00:10:36,75
and stewart spelt with a
city here i think. My name.

125
00:10:36,77 --> 00:10:37,52
Stuart anderson.

126
00:10:38,47 --> 00:10:44,29
And i've lived on body farm for 15 years
ever since it began father of four

127
00:10:44,29 --> 00:10:47,04
children and sole parent now.

128
00:10:47,06 --> 00:10:51,01
With what's a part time sole
parent with my three boys come

129
00:10:51,01 --> 00:10:55,61
and go with them to weekly about
and my daughter lives in town.

130
00:10:56,69 --> 00:11:02,81
And. The boys are all born here
in body farm twins born here.

131
00:11:02,83 --> 00:11:04,26
14 years ago

132
00:11:05,22 --> 00:11:10,90
and then the next boy 12 years old also
so i'm very much part of this place.

133
00:11:10,94 --> 00:11:16,50
You know i feel a lot of affinity for
the land and the people here and i know

134
00:11:16,50 --> 00:11:22,04
that i'm well. Well loved and.

135
00:11:22,82 --> 00:11:28,92
I feel needed and part of the place
and that's a wonderful feeling. And.

136
00:11:28,93 --> 00:11:31,29
I've done a range of things in my life.

137
00:11:33,13 --> 00:11:36,92
When i first came here i was a
potter and i set up a pottery.

138
00:11:37,72 --> 00:11:43,51
Here which was pretty difficult to do
when they had twins at the same time.

139
00:11:44,47 --> 00:11:48,04
And in those days you know i had both.

140
00:11:48,06 --> 00:11:50,91
Messages running inside of
me but to not be on the dole

141
00:11:50,91 --> 00:11:55,90
and get myself established and be the
provider and also to be the new age dad

142
00:11:55,90 --> 00:11:59,72
and do at least 50 per cent of the childcare
which meant that i just was running.

143
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,35
That's crazy. And.

144
00:12:04,36 --> 00:12:08,80
New age though we considered ourselves i
don't think our communication was very

145
00:12:08,80 --> 00:12:10,39
good in those in that marriage and.

146
00:12:12,10 --> 00:12:15,49
And so seven years later we split up
and it was just it was pretty hard.

147
00:12:19,17 --> 00:12:20,08
We weren't easy and i felt

148
00:12:20,08 --> 00:12:22,92
that i think of ourselves enough time
to really enjoy each other's company

149
00:12:22,92 --> 00:12:27,50
and so on.

150
00:12:27,52 --> 00:12:32,67
When i go from there.

151
00:12:32,68 --> 00:12:38,89
So there were quite a few things
that attracted me to body farm

152
00:12:38,89 --> 00:12:45,15
and the spiritual or the inquiry into
life sort of side of it was a strong one.

153
00:12:45,41 --> 00:12:50,46
I had been investigating various.

154
00:12:51,32 --> 00:12:54,57
So-called spiritual avenues
and under margi's and so on

155
00:12:54,57 --> 00:12:57,77
and i hadn't been particularly drawn to
any of them transcendental meditation

156
00:12:57,77 --> 00:13:04,34
or whatever. And when i came of
here and met. The people and.

157
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:09,85
And talked to them about their
approach with meditation and inquiry.

158
00:13:10,65 --> 00:13:16,28
I was really impressed he was a no
non-dogmatic straightforward sort of.

159
00:13:16,29 --> 00:13:21,68
Practical way of sort of
gaining wisdom becoming.

160
00:13:21,70 --> 00:13:26,29
Getting to know oneself and getting
to know all of life and so on.

161
00:13:26,31 --> 00:13:30,79
And of course there was lots
of in those days we were.

162
00:13:31,64 --> 00:13:32,57
Most people have been to india

163
00:13:33,48 --> 00:13:37,53
and so there were a lot of wearing of
just sort of indian type clothes for the

164
00:13:37,53 --> 00:13:38,64
women and for the men.

165
00:13:39,25 --> 00:13:41,71
And using indian phrases and so on

166
00:13:41,71 --> 00:13:45,85
and also it for what do you say tricky
things around enlightenment and garriott

167
00:13:45,85 --> 00:13:49,87
and things like that. Which i could
take or leave i'd been to india

168
00:13:49,87 --> 00:13:53,46
but not not on a spiritual quest and
more i thought more as a traveller

169
00:13:53,46 --> 00:13:56,51
and just enjoying seeing the place and

170
00:13:57,32 --> 00:14:00,93
and all the all the different
travellers i met. And.

171
00:14:03,83 --> 00:14:08,06
So that's one thing that attracted me
was a non-dogmatic fairly practical.

172
00:14:08,08 --> 00:14:11,77
Inquiry and the time put
aside for that and and

173
00:14:11,78 --> 00:14:13,41
that was attractive not
only just for myself

174
00:14:13,41 --> 00:14:16,82
but i also realized it had got
implications for the community it meant

175
00:14:16,82 --> 00:14:19,93
that any conflict or controversy whatever

176
00:14:19,93 --> 00:14:24,14
that arose was looked at in the light of
all what can we can learn from this two

177
00:14:24,14 --> 00:14:27,32
people having differing opinions or
really feeling angry with each other.

178
00:14:27,59 --> 00:14:30,82
Also behind them and within
the community was expected.

179
00:14:31,39 --> 00:14:36,83
Of ourselves and of each
other that we we would and.

180
00:14:38,01 --> 00:14:40,12
Ask ourselves how my
contributing to this conflict

181
00:14:40,12 --> 00:14:47,12
or whatever it is so it was all grist for
the mill all things to learn more from.

182
00:14:47,14 --> 00:14:51,64
So that was attractive. What else is
attractive about it all this bush this land.

183
00:14:52,75 --> 00:14:54,17
It was originally i don't
know if you've been told.

184
00:14:55,35 --> 00:14:59,10
Chosen because it had a lovely swimming
hole that's about how practical we were

185
00:14:59,98 --> 00:15:01,86
that running around looking for land.

186
00:15:01,90 --> 00:15:05,30
There's a lovely swing swing on this
bit of land and by that you know

187
00:15:05,30 --> 00:15:06,99
and so agriculturally it's ridiculous.

188
00:15:06,99 --> 00:15:09,65
And i think one of the main advantages is

189
00:15:09,65 --> 00:15:13,20
that it's not directly on a on a
main road or anything like that.

190
00:15:13,39 --> 00:15:16,55
And so it's very very
quiet and peaceful here.

191
00:15:16,57 --> 00:15:21,39
And people have to make a bit of an effort
to come here i mean it's not a road all

192
00:15:21,39 --> 00:15:26,80
the way and and while they were only half
an hour from town it just seems like.

193
00:15:26,82 --> 00:15:28,50
It's not easy just to drop in

194
00:15:30,39 --> 00:15:35,08
and.

195
00:15:36,10 --> 00:15:39,16
You know know personally i wasn't.

196
00:15:39,52 --> 00:15:43,99
I've been living on the down in a little
town called to wander which is just in

197
00:15:43,99 --> 00:15:46,99
and of eden and far south
coast of new south wales.

198
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:50,83
And i really enjoyed the
village life there.

199
00:15:51,44 --> 00:15:55,35
Knowing the locals and their history that
went right back and feeling excepted

200
00:15:55,35 --> 00:15:59,24
and feeling like i could contribute and
that they helped me and so on and so.

201
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,14
One thing i regret regretted about moving
on to this community is i didn't get to

202
00:16:04,14 --> 00:16:07,25
meet the local so much because we
were so busy building our houses

203
00:16:07,25 --> 00:16:11,08
and getting to know each other and
something in our lovely city and so on

204
00:16:11,08 --> 00:16:13,61
and me you know young babies everywhere

205
00:16:13,61 --> 00:16:16,60
that i didn't get a chance to meet
the locals and i've always felt

206
00:16:16,60 --> 00:16:17,78
that sort of a gap and.

207
00:16:18,37 --> 00:16:21,17
It seems inevitable in
a way and and out of

208
00:16:21,17 --> 00:16:25,01
that gap there's been a lot of misconceptions
about voting and what we're about

209
00:16:25,01 --> 00:16:30,07
and. But. For example
the year before last.

210
00:16:30,53 --> 00:16:31,64
Every year we go on

211
00:16:31,64 --> 00:16:36,53
and then we spend a week together having
what we call our annual general meeting

212
00:16:36,53 --> 00:16:37,21
it's a company.

213
00:16:37,58 --> 00:16:40,75
Because we're a company owns the land for
us we have to have this meeting legally

214
00:16:40,75 --> 00:16:44,03
but we use it as an excuse to
spend time with one another.

215
00:16:44,21 --> 00:16:47,84
Talking about more long term things and
just enjoy each other's company and play

216
00:16:47,84 --> 00:16:52,83
and have fun and we went to a camping
ground called would you head.

217
00:16:52,85 --> 00:16:58,39
And one of us overheard some other campus
eight on campus say to another i heard

218
00:16:58,39 --> 00:17:02,36
bowtie farms here but i haven't seen
anyone in robes yet you know and it's just

219
00:17:02,36 --> 00:17:05,35
that. You know it's incredible.

220
00:17:05,39 --> 00:17:10,26
For us and in the early days there
was also the resistance from.

221
00:17:10,95 --> 00:17:13,79
We've come to be known
as as the old settlers

222
00:17:13,79 --> 00:17:18,17
and there was rumor spread
about us deliberately and and.

223
00:17:18,18 --> 00:17:22,81
You know that we sold babies that women
who came and really that we sold babies

224
00:17:22,81 --> 00:17:25,14
and there was a price. I can't
remember how much ten thousand

225
00:17:25,14 --> 00:17:27,36
or twenty thousand dollars or
something already kill us and

226
00:17:27,36 --> 00:17:29,30
that no woman could come here

227
00:17:30,25 --> 00:17:33,16
and leave unless she was pregnant for
some reason we never quite figured

228
00:17:33,16 --> 00:17:36,86
that one out but they were all
rumors designed to put us down

229
00:17:36,86 --> 00:17:42,69
and make us less acceptable or not acceptable
and that was just a small percentage.

230
00:17:43,02 --> 00:17:49,15
I think of the local. Because
because having twins. Was hard.

231
00:17:49,19 --> 00:17:53,01
We didn't we hadn't built a house yet
we were in a a large tent on the floor.

232
00:17:53,66 --> 00:17:58,26
We had a hot water but we didn't.
It was a crazy way to have babies.

233
00:18:02,67 --> 00:18:05,73
And some of the locals who
were very conservative

234
00:18:05,73 --> 00:18:07,96
or really very very supportive
they let us come and

235
00:18:07,96 --> 00:18:09,67
when it had been raining
for months or whatever.

236
00:18:09,96 --> 00:18:12,52
We could go and wash our
nappies there and dry them

237
00:18:12,52 --> 00:18:16,62
and then just help us out in whatever way
they could we stayed in there have a cup

238
00:18:16,62 --> 00:18:20,16
of tea while the washing was being
done and and they were terrific

239
00:18:20,16 --> 00:18:22,37
and it wasn't until the.

240
00:18:23,82 --> 00:18:26,11
Tourney a creek dispute which
sort of split the community

241
00:18:27,17 --> 00:18:30,47
that suddenly they turned cold and they
we just couldn't relate in the same way

242
00:18:30,47 --> 00:18:33,13
and i felt really sad about
that and i imagine they did too

243
00:18:33,13 --> 00:18:37,67
but at the time i just was so upset and.

244
00:18:37,68 --> 00:18:42,11
Somehow in my upset i accepted that
they had to cut off from me like

245
00:18:42,11 --> 00:18:45,67
that.

246
00:18:48,11 --> 00:18:52,60
Well we were in reasons for coming here.
Reasons for joining this community.

247
00:18:53,28 --> 00:18:58,53
I often end it. I was brought up in
canberra or in my high school years

248
00:18:58,53 --> 00:19:02,79
and i often envied some couple of my younger
brothers who had gone to the school

249
00:19:02,79 --> 00:19:07,92
without walls where in canberra which
had a much freer and easier atmosphere

250
00:19:07,92 --> 00:19:10,74
and the students and the teachers
were more intimate with one another

251
00:19:10,74 --> 00:19:12,76
that they were very friendly
gave each other hugs

252
00:19:12,76 --> 00:19:17,12
and seem to have a lot of fun together
rather than just a normal straightjacket of

253
00:19:17,12 --> 00:19:20,63
school and so i sort of jealous
of that scene and i came here

254
00:19:20,63 --> 00:19:24,33
and i just walked into a scene like
that where people were very open

255
00:19:24,33 --> 00:19:26,41
and friendly and warm to me

256
00:19:26,41 --> 00:19:32,90
and invited me to converse with them
at a deeper level i suppose the normal

257
00:19:32,90 --> 00:19:37,30
and that really attracted
me i felt immediately.

258
00:19:38,17 --> 00:19:42,10
That i wanted to live like that
with a group of people like

259
00:19:42,10 --> 00:19:44,77
that i had investigated other
communities before that

260
00:19:44,77 --> 00:19:46,78
and come across one quite like that.

261
00:19:54,40 --> 00:19:59,57
Yeah. Yeah. Yea.

262
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:00,48
We

263
00:20:00,48 --> 00:20:06,88
and i were very idealistic in those days really
idealistic we thought we would do everything

264
00:20:06,88 --> 00:20:09,83
for ourselves. That we could so

265
00:20:09,83 --> 00:20:13,50
that was build our own hoses
furniture have our own births

266
00:20:13,50 --> 00:20:19,72
and our own ceremonies to our own
roads. And our own income somehow.

267
00:20:19,74 --> 00:20:26,64
And it was you know no one
wanted tavy on the place and.

268
00:20:28,29 --> 00:20:31,52
We had this sort of creative.

269
00:20:32,45 --> 00:20:35,79
Live simply so others can simply
live that was voluntary simplicity

270
00:20:37,03 --> 00:20:41,47
and.

271
00:20:42,44 --> 00:20:44,28
And that.

272
00:20:44,30 --> 00:20:46,35
So you know i've got no one to blame

273
00:20:46,35 --> 00:20:48,89
but myself in a way fit
for what we went through

274
00:20:48,89 --> 00:20:53,13
but so you know trying to build a house
which wasn't a mud brick house of course

275
00:20:53,84 --> 00:20:58,93
you know which you know took a lot
of work and get a pottery together

276
00:20:58,93 --> 00:21:05,86
and raise young babies. Crazy way.
You know the chip heater for a bath.

277
00:21:05,88 --> 00:21:09,35
So we but time was just a lot more than
turning on the tap and to find the wood

278
00:21:09,35 --> 00:21:13,02
and like the five it is a damp climate
everything every day would be wet

279
00:21:13,02 --> 00:21:19,85
and hard to light and so on. We made
it really hard for ourselves. And.

280
00:21:19,86 --> 00:21:24,18
But the early people are came onto this
community were the pioneering time

281
00:21:25,19 --> 00:21:30,59
and. Warwick not a member of this
community was only commenting to me.

282
00:21:30,61 --> 00:21:37,13
I think this morning or yesterday morning
that. I think back on those days.

283
00:21:38,27 --> 00:21:38,93
He wasn't there.

284
00:21:39,24 --> 00:21:44,65
Just thinking about what we did you like
industry early fine im sure we had cars

285
00:21:44,65 --> 00:21:49,06
and some other you know we had more
resources at our disposal but.

286
00:21:49,08 --> 00:21:54,35
We really wanted to do it from the
beginning and doing it for ourselves and.

287
00:21:54,37 --> 00:21:56,72
For the first couple of
years it was sort of.

288
00:21:56,74 --> 00:21:59,63
Frowned upon to go out of the
community just fear itself.

289
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,89
If you know if you are going to go out
then you should buy food for everyone else

290
00:22:03,89 --> 00:22:07,00
all the other people's needs and
so going out was a major trip.

291
00:22:07,12 --> 00:22:11,54
It just meant if you. If you'd
be out all day and we just had.

292
00:22:12,68 --> 00:22:17,27
We had communicators and i was along with
another man with it was a mechanic so.

293
00:22:18,65 --> 00:22:24,28
We worked on the community carpool while
others were part of the roster cooking

294
00:22:24,28 --> 00:22:29,52
roster because we eat together every day.

295
00:22:29,54 --> 00:22:34,79
And so you know they were really sort
of heady days to remain in the working

296
00:22:34,80 --> 00:22:39,41
together a lot on buildings. Feeling like
we're all contributing to the same thing.

297
00:22:40,31 --> 00:22:43,42
Whatever that was we weren't quite
you know couldn't quite be named

298
00:22:43,42 --> 00:22:48,17
but it was building this community
sharing our lives together.

299
00:22:49,55 --> 00:22:52,54
As.

300
00:22:53,78 --> 00:22:58,22
Well mine broke up but i i can't
blame just become you know setting.

301
00:22:58,90 --> 00:23:03,80
Was a lot of factors.

302
00:23:03,82 --> 00:23:10,30
And all of i mean terms of
partnership relationships.

303
00:23:11,59 --> 00:23:17,33
And i think any survivor. But
that's not so unusual and.

304
00:23:17,35 --> 00:23:21,70
In it in these times and in this
area in australia whatever.

305
00:23:21,84 --> 00:23:25,55
Anyway.

306
00:23:26,64 --> 00:23:30,05
It was it wasn't in terms the relationships
of people in this community.

307
00:23:30,37 --> 00:23:33,65
It wasn't apparent to me
that it was a strain.

308
00:23:33,70 --> 00:23:36,93
Well i think for some people who found it.

309
00:23:39,48 --> 00:23:44,28
Who weren't so building oriented
because that's the way or.

310
00:23:44,30 --> 00:23:49,92
They if they found that more
difficult and i know unfortunately.

311
00:23:49,94 --> 00:23:52,88
Because i don't really know why

312
00:23:52,88 --> 00:23:55,51
but which suddenly had a whole
lot of babies all at once.

313
00:23:56,79 --> 00:23:59,87
And it meant that the sex
role division just got set.

314
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,64
Women had babies who were breast feeding

315
00:24:01,64 --> 00:24:06,87
and so to get them involved in the building
was difficult especially because they

316
00:24:06,87 --> 00:24:10,59
had to be they just didn't seem
inclined to pick it up in the same way

317
00:24:10,59 --> 00:24:17,33
that the men expected of them
so. I mean this building.

318
00:24:17,35 --> 00:24:23,12
We're sitting in the body farm
community center at the moment and.

319
00:24:23,14 --> 00:24:29,34
I think about five or six years into our.

320
00:24:29,36 --> 00:24:32,61
Since we were established i
suggested to the community

321
00:24:32,61 --> 00:24:36,00
that we put aside for months.

322
00:24:36,05 --> 00:24:39,90
All of us try and sort of stop
whatever work we were doing.

323
00:24:39,92 --> 00:24:43,15
To work together on the community center
because at the time we were in a shack

324
00:24:43,15 --> 00:24:44,19
that we called the barn

325
00:24:44,19 --> 00:24:48,10
and it was really we were beginning
to get pretty shamed of it.

326
00:24:48,16 --> 00:24:52,41
It was very hard to keep
clean and to function in

327
00:24:53,18 --> 00:24:56,45
and it just wasn't impressive to
many of the many visitors that

328
00:24:56,45 --> 00:24:58,73
that came our way we
attracted a lot of visitors

329
00:24:59,52 --> 00:25:00,52
and that's another story in itself.

330
00:25:00,76 --> 00:25:04,54
That was the multiple
occupancy fight and so on.

331
00:25:04,56 --> 00:25:08,14
And my part of my dream in
that that i did express

332
00:25:08,14 --> 00:25:10,57
but i don't think was taken on anyway.

333
00:25:10,61 --> 00:25:13,03
Was that we'd work together on
that we teach each other building

334
00:25:13,03 --> 00:25:14,18
and there would be any quality.

335
00:25:14,76 --> 00:25:20,25
In how we'd build this building and
unfortunately i was away at the time.

336
00:25:20,27 --> 00:25:23,49
Just for a month or so.
At the time that two

337
00:25:23,49 --> 00:25:25,01
or three others got into designing it

338
00:25:25,01 --> 00:25:27,87
and they designed this building which
is you know beautiful to look at it.

339
00:25:27,88 --> 00:25:33,01
Six sided and has it has a roof with a
little pig on top and light coming in and

340
00:25:33,84 --> 00:25:39,64
and the kitchen's you know spacious
with. Lots of bench space and so on.

341
00:25:40,64 --> 00:25:43,14
Lots of wood and it's
high up with a good view

342
00:25:43,87 --> 00:25:47,27
and if you look at it it's not an easy
building to build if you're a novice builder

343
00:25:47,27 --> 00:25:50,07
every joint is an angle in it and.

344
00:25:50,90 --> 00:25:53,56
And so you need an expert to
tell you what to do which meant.

345
00:25:54,26 --> 00:25:54,70
Which meant

346
00:25:54,70 --> 00:25:58,39
that the same old divisions of labor
sprang up people feel disempowered.

347
00:25:58,61 --> 00:25:59,82
The ones that didn't know how.

348
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:04,02
Really used tools and some what used
to building felt this empowered them

349
00:26:04,02 --> 00:26:07,84
and there was this energy to just get
this building built that i just couldn't.

350
00:26:07,86 --> 00:26:09,17
No matter what i said.

351
00:26:09,84 --> 00:26:13,87
I couldn't hold back in fact
at it and literally happened

352
00:26:13,87 --> 00:26:15,71
that i said look i'm not
happy with this design

353
00:26:15,71 --> 00:26:18,07
and people said no we just
want to get on with it more

354
00:26:18,07 --> 00:26:21,72
or less rushed out of our little shack
and started going for it. Assessed.

355
00:26:21,92 --> 00:26:25,15
I couldn't. And and you know.

356
00:26:25,49 --> 00:26:30,72
Then once in the in the difficult
position of wanting something different

357
00:26:30,72 --> 00:26:37,19
but not wanting to. Put it down
on everyone a damper on things.

358
00:26:37,20 --> 00:26:38,87
And people didn't understand
what i was talking about.

359
00:26:39,19 --> 00:26:43,83
So what was that point coming from.

360
00:26:45,22 --> 00:26:51,94
People. You know yet.

361
00:26:52,75 --> 00:26:54,10
Yet.

362
00:26:56,45 --> 00:27:00,80
You know with the idealism in the
early days was a sort of a dogmatism.

363
00:27:02,09 --> 00:27:04,79
And a sort of a control of
each other and our behavior

364
00:27:04,79 --> 00:27:08,69
and we have we had a lot
of agreements for instance

365
00:27:08,69 --> 00:27:12,78
and these were sort of like rules.
Although there was no sanctions.

366
00:27:12,92 --> 00:27:17,64
It was just what you agreed to and
things like we had no alcohol no dope.

367
00:27:17,75 --> 00:27:21,14
No dogs and cats and.

368
00:27:21,16 --> 00:27:25,70
Well things that we still hold to
i we have social alcohol here now

369
00:27:25,70 --> 00:27:28,72
but we also had things like not
driving on to the community

370
00:27:28,72 --> 00:27:30,38
and they absolutely had to so

371
00:27:30,38 --> 00:27:33,43
that would be a car free space all
around the houses which is lovely

372
00:27:34,15 --> 00:27:34,77
but which meant

373
00:27:34,77 --> 00:27:38,28
that some people ended up you know
we all bearing huge loads back

374
00:27:38,28 --> 00:27:41,40
and forth along the road
to their place and.

375
00:27:42,79 --> 00:27:48,06
You know really taking the
brunt of a decision. And.

376
00:27:49,54 --> 00:27:54,99
There were there was also unspoken
agreements like for some reason in the early

377
00:27:54,99 --> 00:27:59,93
days no one had a radio and.
We just sort of we will see.

378
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,05
No inward looking so we just wanted to
get this scene together we didn't really

379
00:28:05,05 --> 00:28:08,80
want to structurally from
the outside world. I think.

380
00:28:08,82 --> 00:28:11,30
And when when finally
one family wanted it.

381
00:28:11,36 --> 00:28:14,81
He there was a big debate
which went on for months

382
00:28:14,82 --> 00:28:19,28
and until the people wanting the t.v. Got
very frustrated. Just got one anyway.

383
00:28:20,39 --> 00:28:20,61
And

384
00:28:22,08 --> 00:28:26,48
that caused a fuel because some people were
varia trapped attached to the consensus

385
00:28:26,48 --> 00:28:29,68
process where we all have to agree before
anything happens which is generally

386
00:28:29,68 --> 00:28:32,55
wonderful and.

387
00:28:32,57 --> 00:28:36,77
The consensus process i mean
is i really like it but

388
00:28:37,73 --> 00:28:41,67
but it can lead to dogmatism and.

389
00:28:41,68 --> 00:28:45,91
And i don't think that's healthy means
that when people feel restricted by

390
00:28:45,92 --> 00:28:49,02
that sort of thing. It'll come
out sideways when some other way

391
00:28:49,02 --> 00:28:51,32
or come out in the future
and some unhealthy way

392
00:28:53,09 --> 00:28:56,58
that i mean this still is a little bit of
i don't know i mean some people call it

393
00:28:56,58 --> 00:29:00,65
dogmatism other people would call it
common sense you know vegetarianism.

394
00:29:00,67 --> 00:29:04,76
I mean that one man not
thinking very clearly

395
00:29:04,76 --> 00:29:09,74
or something that's bought a little saveloy
for first they've had to the other day

396
00:29:09,74 --> 00:29:11,07
and that upset

397
00:29:11,07 --> 00:29:16,01
that really upset quite a few other members
because there was a vegetarian ism to

398
00:29:16,01 --> 00:29:21,32
them means he's part of their
caring for life and so.

399
00:29:21,33 --> 00:29:24,85
Although they weren't eating the meat they
really felt like none of us should you

400
00:29:24,85 --> 00:29:26,03
know on this community

401
00:29:26,03 --> 00:29:29,90
that that's what all our rules are you
know like no meat on the community.

402
00:29:29,91 --> 00:29:34,25
No hope and so on and on
the community which means

403
00:29:34,25 --> 00:29:38,30
that you know technically you can
go off and have your sausage

404
00:29:38,30 --> 00:29:42,57
and a joint you know across the other side
of the water if you want straight back

405
00:29:42,57 --> 00:29:49,35
in but it's that yeah the rules are.

406
00:29:50,16 --> 00:29:53,61
There. I see is more of a.

407
00:29:55,70 --> 00:29:59,91
When you say guidelines or to give
someone special from who's come.

408
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,57
For the place for the first time an idea
of what evaluate are they more a set of

409
00:30:03,57 --> 00:30:03,67
values

410
00:30:04,60 --> 00:30:07,92
but we did have we had five precepts as
well which were more buddhist in origin.

411
00:30:08,10 --> 00:30:12,49
No killing no lying no
taking what is not given.

412
00:30:12,51 --> 00:30:15,32
No sex that hurts others.

413
00:30:16,05 --> 00:30:21,08
No intoxicants or no things that confuse
the mind and they were more guidelines

414
00:30:21,08 --> 00:30:26,59
and they're speaking of our values
and and they're still there

415
00:30:26,59 --> 00:30:33,02
and every one of them has been broken.
You know. So. Yet we hear them. Sure.

416
00:30:34,58 --> 00:30:39,40
Exactly exactly. So i
think there's a relaxed.

417
00:30:39,42 --> 00:30:44,27
Feel around those rules and agreements
these days and guidelines and so on.

418
00:30:44,42 --> 00:30:46,73
They know they're not spoken of much and.

419
00:30:48,62 --> 00:30:50,43
They more or less just set
the scene or something.

420
00:30:52,85 --> 00:30:57,08
And these days we i mean we do have a
meditation hall on the property of it's very

421
00:30:57,08 --> 00:31:01,78
rarely used. And there's no.
Schedule or anything like that.

422
00:31:01,95 --> 00:31:05,27
So it's just if someone wakes up in the
morning and decides to go and meditate

423
00:31:06,32 --> 00:31:08,33
and i'll go down there and
bang on the gong outside

424
00:31:08,33 --> 00:31:10,92
and as an invitation for
anyone else to join them and

425
00:31:10,92 --> 00:31:15,76
when i threw others my
title down. And that's it.

426
00:31:15,78 --> 00:31:18,03
Or they were still involved in
running meditation retreats

427
00:31:18,03 --> 00:31:22,64
and meditation still very important in
some people's lives here but not everyone.

428
00:31:22,94 --> 00:31:25,93
But inquiry. Is still important.

429
00:31:26,28 --> 00:31:29,71
I would say doesn't have the same
intensity that it did in the well

430
00:31:29,71 --> 00:31:33,36
that idea of enquiry being important
doesn't have the same intensity as it did

431
00:31:34,08 --> 00:31:37,59
but still there and i really
value that personally.
