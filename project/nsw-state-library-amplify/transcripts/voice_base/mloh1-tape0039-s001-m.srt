1
00:00:03,85 --> 00:00:05,61
I'm speaking to mr.

2
00:00:05,61 --> 00:00:11,23
Norman. Count kind who worked on the sydney
harbour bridge workshops at milton's

3
00:00:11,24 --> 00:00:18,15
point. And i'm asking first when you promised
wake up in sydney where bratton said

4
00:00:19,28 --> 00:00:24,56
paddington you know and what were the
circumstances. You knew were going days what

5
00:00:24,56 --> 00:00:30,18
was your and your father and mother. Well
i was left most of the my mother looked

6
00:00:30,18 --> 00:00:34,38
after me. Mostly my father went
down and what did he do for

7
00:00:34,38 --> 00:00:41,08
a living. Well he was in the
furnishing business and when then on

8
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:47,54
a soldier and from then on we got right out
of touch. And what was it. We do go to

9
00:00:47,54 --> 00:00:53,32
school. Well several because
graphically we moved around

10
00:00:53,32 --> 00:01:00,20
a bit but my last girl was camp and grammar
school that was situated at narelle and

11
00:01:01,27 --> 00:01:08,26
. And earlier i went to the first girl
i went to i think was one public. And

12
00:01:09,58 --> 00:01:14,16
a couple of others in between. I we went
to adelaide at one stage and i went to

13
00:01:14,16 --> 00:01:17,47
a college. There was
it was actually it was

14
00:01:17,47 --> 00:01:24,44
a salvation army. Run place and
it was all right. You know

15
00:01:24,44 --> 00:01:24,98
fair but

16
00:01:24,98 --> 00:01:32,10
a bit hard for me what subjects did
you like best subject i was ballin

17
00:01:32,10 --> 00:01:38,96
. And i like to listen to history
but you know i can memorize it

18
00:01:38,96 --> 00:01:43,06
and become good at it you know you're
required to memorize dates in those days.

19
00:01:45,17 --> 00:01:45,78
Yeah that was

20
00:01:45,78 --> 00:01:51,14
a big problem. What was your first job
and the chemist shop and william street

21
00:01:51,14 --> 00:01:52,16
sydney. It's

22
00:01:52,16 --> 00:01:58,94
a park and i think what you know
not so very long and then i. My

23
00:01:58,94 --> 00:02:05,72
mother was steward us at that time. And
she'd arranged with these people for me to

24
00:02:05,72 --> 00:02:11,37
be apprenticed to plastering in wellington
new zealand. So i went over on the

25
00:02:11,37 --> 00:02:13,73
element hour and i was there for about

26
00:02:13,73 --> 00:02:20,68
a while but two years. Did you
like that. I enjoyed it because

27
00:02:20,68 --> 00:02:21,88
i was young enough it was

28
00:02:21,88 --> 00:02:27,85
a sort of an adventure but i was away from
everybody i knew and but i got in with

29
00:02:27,85 --> 00:02:30,80
some nice people named newman and i was

30
00:02:30,80 --> 00:02:37,49
a sort of extra boy. They had two sons. And
when you didn't get any more schooling

31
00:02:37,49 --> 00:02:43,97
after that. Now you know i passed the
intermediate at camera grammar school

32
00:02:44,75 --> 00:02:51,63
and that was the finish of the schooling
yes. And from there. Your father he was

33
00:02:51,63 --> 00:02:53,02
away at the war during that time was

34
00:02:53,02 --> 00:03:00,01
a. Yes. Well he was from boy
until eighteen or nineteen and

35
00:03:00,02 --> 00:03:02,07
then he went around the country quite

36
00:03:02,07 --> 00:03:08,98
a lot. So how old were you then.
Well i can't have anybody left from

37
00:03:08,98 --> 00:03:10,94
double by pay that's

38
00:03:10,94 --> 00:03:17,50
a visit. Kind of member really
i'm guessing about eight

39
00:03:17,50 --> 00:03:21,94
something like that. Do you remember him
going away particularly well i remember

40
00:03:21,94 --> 00:03:27,64
seeing him on the tram and when he went
away. You know me. What's about to

41
00:03:27,64 --> 00:03:33,59
shellings i think you're going to shellings
in my hand when he got on the fam. But

42
00:03:34,52 --> 00:03:38,70
i stuck him several times
after that but he wasn't

43
00:03:38,70 --> 00:03:40,63
a father as far as you know he was

44
00:03:40,63 --> 00:03:47,19
a list and most gentle and
when the man but he drank.

45
00:03:47,83 --> 00:03:54,47
And of course he used to turn up at all
sorts of places but there never will.

46
00:03:54,53 --> 00:03:55,33
This is

47
00:03:55,33 --> 00:04:02,16
a hand to me and there was he also got
to your mother in that sense. Yes. Yeah

48
00:04:02,16 --> 00:04:07,73
kind of thing but unreliable.
I'm getting a bit. I have

49
00:04:07,73 --> 00:04:14,58
a spell. So how did you come
to be working on the sydney

50
00:04:14,58 --> 00:04:21,54
harbour bridge. Well that we were
living in forbes street darlinghurst

51
00:04:23,82 --> 00:04:29,26
in a sort of a flat type of
thing and it was owned by

52
00:04:30,06 --> 00:04:34,91
a fellow named jimmy chilvers
who was the foreman of the

53
00:04:37,31 --> 00:04:38,27
he was a sort of

54
00:04:38,27 --> 00:04:44,87
a panic and buy us some foreman where
i was working on the cranes and i

55
00:04:44,88 --> 00:04:45,32
couldn't get

56
00:04:45,32 --> 00:04:53,38
a job mother was quite ill and
she couldn't work anymore so.

57
00:04:55,52 --> 00:05:01,37
Here and for me to go down there. The age
part of it. Well i was about the same

58
00:05:01,37 --> 00:05:06,90
size as i am now so i passed. All those
strange then up one of the chaps at work

59
00:05:06,90 --> 00:05:10,73
down there a fellow name said lowe is

60
00:05:10,74 --> 00:05:15,73
a pretty bright bloke. He said i knew you
weren't twenty one because he said you

61
00:05:15,73 --> 00:05:19,65
didn't talk like a twenty one year
old he said there was yes it talk

62
00:05:19,65 --> 00:05:26,10
a bit silly here. So but i did i
got full money and Â£5 fifteen

63
00:05:26,10 --> 00:05:31,57
a week. I think it was. And i
lasted until such time as i became

64
00:05:31,57 --> 00:05:38,01
a dance and it was that chilvers
that wasn't he. Clayton killed

65
00:05:38,70 --> 00:05:44,19
was killed. Yes and his brother says
his son. Cecil was also working there.

66
00:05:46,85 --> 00:05:51,91
Do you remember the circumstances of his
being killed in power. It happened after i

67
00:05:51,91 --> 00:05:58,82
was. Put off but i did hear that they was

68
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:00,23
taking

69
00:06:00,24 --> 00:06:05,39
a left with us. And i say i'm the punts
to put some timber and i need to get the

70
00:06:05,39 --> 00:06:08,34
change and there was a bit of

71
00:06:08,34 --> 00:06:14,41
a wash and i slept. I came down here when
the teen and i believe both his neck and

72
00:06:14,41 --> 00:06:19,82
knocked him back into the water and said
that that tallies with what i've already

73
00:06:19,82 --> 00:06:26,71
heard and seen in the in the hopes
of the inquest. Yes. Yeah well i

74
00:06:26,71 --> 00:06:30,73
just heard it. You know secondhand
because i was off quite

75
00:06:30,73 --> 00:06:37,72
a while when you working there. What
was the job like well i liked it. It

76
00:06:37,73 --> 00:06:43,79
was really exciting type of thing in
many ways. At times i've got buying

77
00:06:44,75 --> 00:06:50,58
you know you know all sorts of pieces of
the whole you know all marked and we had

78
00:06:50,58 --> 00:06:57,47
to unload them and then sort them
in the stacks. And let them from

79
00:06:57,47 --> 00:07:01,06
overseas ships mostly the
piano used to come in

80
00:07:01,06 --> 00:07:04,92
a lot and some down the power pass it

81
00:07:08,43 --> 00:07:15,41
. Came from newcastle. It was quite
small and it used to being longer lines

82
00:07:16,22 --> 00:07:21,66
eight sign. And was it dangerous. Joe

83
00:07:22,82 --> 00:07:29,81
a couple of times or several times. Yes
but dangerous. What size were the plates.

84
00:07:30,81 --> 00:07:37,19
Well some of those plates. Would be
forty feet and about six feet wide.

85
00:07:38,24 --> 00:07:41,65
Sometimes they used to
buckle over and i always had

86
00:07:41,65 --> 00:07:48,51
a tail on them to stop them
from slipping so. And the wind

87
00:07:48,51 --> 00:07:51,05
was often very difficult because of just

88
00:07:51,05 --> 00:07:57,55
a feeling on us we have to grab
the end of the day here and then

89
00:07:58,60 --> 00:08:05,59
run the crane on and then down there
with the angles any any easier or where

90
00:08:05,59 --> 00:08:12,17
they'd gone so very very dangerous because
i couldn't string them powell out of

91
00:08:12,17 --> 00:08:14,82
a ship's hold so they had a saying

92
00:08:14,82 --> 00:08:21,75
a month and then. Well to do that
they had to put timber all round to

93
00:08:21,75 --> 00:08:23,31
give the chain or turn

94
00:08:23,31 --> 00:08:30,06
a bit of paper and one day. I was going

95
00:08:30,06 --> 00:08:36,66
up in my job to grab the tail of
it and put on the. Waste and put

96
00:08:38,34 --> 00:08:45,19
. Timbers down there so it would be able
to get time done to lift them over to the

97
00:08:45,19 --> 00:08:52,05
gantry. And just as i went to grab
it. I heard that noise to say

98
00:08:52,06 --> 00:08:58,30
some of them. I think how. And i
realised it was temping so so i mean

99
00:09:00,21 --> 00:09:06,00
i was the one that was going in there and
i think we have to make him want me. So i

100
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:11,44
went up there then back to want to move
point and i heard the clatter and i mean i

101
00:09:11,44 --> 00:09:17,02
look. When i got far enough away i mean
one of them. It's mean by that much like

102
00:09:17,03 --> 00:09:23,69
time on again. But when it's best to
inform or planks and also mouthful and

103
00:09:23,69 --> 00:09:30,54
just take about two inches wide and they're
just like i don't standing up and the

104
00:09:30,54 --> 00:09:36,71
other fall now one nearly hit me
and i think that was one bad one

105
00:09:37,99 --> 00:09:38,39
and not

106
00:09:38,39 --> 00:09:45,22
a bad one was when one
mirth in its hip and the

107
00:09:45,22 --> 00:09:48,45
cause of bulk and as

108
00:09:48,45 --> 00:09:55,13
a bouquet make ice and then falling fifty
yards. Tried at me and you know while i

109
00:09:55,13 --> 00:10:01,02
wire snapped control it
can happen. But you know

110
00:10:02,33 --> 00:10:08,75
once in him that i knew who was any and
i have this can be something right.

111
00:10:08,87 --> 00:10:13,03
You know. Julie said that i said i've been

112
00:10:13,03 --> 00:10:18,14
a dancer he said i never seen anybody so
good on their feet but i had to because it

113
00:10:18,14 --> 00:10:21,89
was coming straight out my father turned
round. I would have seen which way it was

114
00:10:21,89 --> 00:10:28,71
coming. Anyway i got by and from that
one and the other dangerous occasion

115
00:10:29,49 --> 00:10:36,09
. Was his angle arms and twelve
by twelve one very long and i was

116
00:10:36,09 --> 00:10:37,21
having a bit of

117
00:10:37,21 --> 00:10:42,98
a sticky riding on the gantry crane while
the other fellows from bring these down

118
00:10:42,98 --> 00:10:49,56
and i got the same noise. They'd been
slowing uneven and i saw them coming out

119
00:10:49,56 --> 00:10:52,92
towards me so i jumped off. And i make

120
00:10:52,92 --> 00:10:59,43
a cup that deep into the air into the
bottom of the gantry crane and slither down

121
00:10:59,43 --> 00:11:01,06
onto the whirlpool over the place i was

122
00:11:01,06 --> 00:11:06,77
a bit fortunate on that occasion that i had
good hearing and i heard it was time to

123
00:11:06,77 --> 00:11:12,53
get out there on the other front trying
time i tell you man. This i was riding on

124
00:11:12,53 --> 00:11:16,88
our cry and we weren't supposed to and i
was rolling on the hooks and said loud was

125
00:11:16,88 --> 00:11:21,93
my cry and driver. He swung right out
over the harbor and then he threw it into

126
00:11:21,93 --> 00:11:27,16
free rock and hear my going down then in
don't mean that all the right up to about

127
00:11:27,16 --> 00:11:32,00
here. I tell you that felt really horrible
because i didn't know just when the

128
00:11:32,00 --> 00:11:37,09
train was swimming but simply something
laughing instead of and i got pretty weapon

129
00:11:38,21 --> 00:11:43,85
temporary scare you know. And that's
that's in lots of other cases. You know.

130
00:11:45,28 --> 00:11:49,63
But. We were going to i think two
shillings of me gets me because i'm the

131
00:11:49,63 --> 00:11:55,18
responsibility of travelling and we're
supposed to ride on the lanes but we often.

132
00:11:56,45 --> 00:12:00,98
We often just stand in the balance place.
All the plates were quite long and so was

133
00:12:00,98 --> 00:12:05,82
quite a few certain shapes you
know and we used to often

134
00:12:06,56 --> 00:12:12,68
a couple of clips each side and stand
on that amount of hold the middle was

135
00:12:12,68 --> 00:12:18,35
a lot of the. The steel knocked about that
it had to be straightened and yes yes.

136
00:12:18,85 --> 00:12:24,63
Those plates are telling about there was
a big well set up at the end. But still

137
00:12:24,63 --> 00:12:31,49
a stored there in there and they just go
into the light family vacation shop and as

138
00:12:31,49 --> 00:12:35,54
me well and then straight and all that.
Do you remember who worked at machine the

139
00:12:35,54 --> 00:12:40,54
mangles well they are if i remember
once drove him look i'm sky he was

140
00:12:40,54 --> 00:12:42,29
a happy guy. If you made

141
00:12:42,29 --> 00:12:48,18
a fire that cricket and football
women play in the houses. He's down

142
00:12:48,18 --> 00:12:53,51
a name i can remember from that. Well you
don't remember the yank you know the

143
00:12:53,52 --> 00:12:57,80
mayor in fact i thought it was i know where
these are if you're not and we called

144
00:12:57,80 --> 00:12:59,61
him scruffy. There was

145
00:12:59,61 --> 00:13:03,61
a fellow and spoke for the door all and
i thought you know and i told me he was

146
00:13:03,61 --> 00:13:08,22
high and there was somebody around the
place that often people called again they

147
00:13:08,22 --> 00:13:12,99
reckon he worked on the mangle so i
don't know. You know. So many different

148
00:13:13,00 --> 00:13:19,99
counties and nationalities down there
was about the angle straight and i

149
00:13:19,99 --> 00:13:25,97
did you see that you know now i live. I
get an idea. In the back of my head about

150
00:13:25,97 --> 00:13:28,59
it but i just can't remember them. I have

151
00:13:28,59 --> 00:13:35,44
a photograph but no names no. What up
the other end there was the was the

152
00:13:35,44 --> 00:13:41,82
plate. What they call it the plane. Each
plane that was that was that near you

153
00:13:41,82 --> 00:13:46,24
where you were working. Didn't say that
working and what about the guillotine that

154
00:13:46,24 --> 00:13:47,13
was to make

155
00:13:47,13 --> 00:13:53,59
a lot of noise. Yes yes i remember the
guillotine. You know very noisy was it came

156
00:13:53,60 --> 00:13:54,40
down and down

157
00:13:54,40 --> 00:13:59,54
a plane. And had to be pretty heavy to cut
through some of this stuff there when

158
00:13:59,54 --> 00:14:03,89
the famous rifle was a bell
about two crap. But yes

159
00:14:03,89 --> 00:14:07,81
a playground lanka like that fell i
mentioned up there. I walked under

160
00:14:07,81 --> 00:14:14,19
a ladder one day i raced home for lunch
because i only just lived above. The time

161
00:14:14,90 --> 00:14:21,71
and i won thirteen thirteen shillings barbers
recall and so i walked under the sun

162
00:14:22,53 --> 00:14:27,60
later the next day and that and
a bit more so. Walking under

163
00:14:27,60 --> 00:14:31,06
a ladder didn't mean that much do you
remember the bloke we do used to run the

164
00:14:31,06 --> 00:14:37,30
crowd americans. I don't know frenchy now
and i don't remember the name and i never

165
00:14:37,30 --> 00:14:42,85
played that much. I got cured i got cured
after those two episodes so it was right

166
00:14:42,85 --> 00:14:47,90
inside. And most of us when we had our
lunch. We'd sit outside cry and i was

167
00:14:47,90 --> 00:14:53,27
a come down. We happened but we happy you
know and then i used to go home now and

168
00:14:53,27 --> 00:14:58,94
then i had to quit because i met up some
steps we lived in alford street right

169
00:14:58,94 --> 00:15:04,71
opposite where my bowling club is now. Do
you remember the some of the boys going

170
00:15:04,71 --> 00:15:07,80
swimming down there. That happened

171
00:15:07,80 --> 00:15:14,07
a few times but not very much. I know we.
Everybody was down there months catching

172
00:15:14,07 --> 00:15:20,82
mackerel there was found thousands
of them. Do you remember

173
00:15:20,82 --> 00:15:26,78
any other events particularly around their
own drummer seeing anything around the

174
00:15:26,78 --> 00:15:30,92
harbour of note you know
i might have to think

175
00:15:30,92 --> 00:15:34,85
a little bit about that i saw plenty i was
the official reader of the ships that

176
00:15:34,85 --> 00:15:41,54
came in an hour because i had good eyes in
those days getting away from the harbour

177
00:15:41,54 --> 00:15:47,95
part of it. I do remember we
went on strike and marched in

178
00:15:47,95 --> 00:15:51,67
and sacco and vanzetti were two i w

179
00:15:51,67 --> 00:15:56,59
w workers in america and
we thought that was

180
00:15:56,59 --> 00:16:01,09
a great adventure the young fellows. You
know to me but since i've thought of it.

181
00:16:01,15 --> 00:16:03,26
It's incredibly stupid to do such

182
00:16:03,26 --> 00:16:07,86
a thing like that when it was so far away
but we're more and centre the donald

183
00:16:07,86 --> 00:16:12,79
grant was at the head of the prince
procession that time as riordan reardon was

184
00:16:12,79 --> 00:16:19,60
a union rep down there very
posing man. And workers

185
00:16:19,60 --> 00:16:26,53
union. Yes it could have us features but
he could he could hold on the audience. He

186
00:16:26,53 --> 00:16:26,59
was

187
00:16:26,59 --> 00:16:33,76
a blacksmith just up from where i worked.
Actually he faced where the way the. I forget

188
00:16:33,76 --> 00:16:38,29
the name of the launch and. To go backwards
and forwards to from those trying to

189
00:16:39,01 --> 00:16:43,70
you know. And that was go out the launch
and up they were to back to stop answering

190
00:16:43,70 --> 00:16:48,04
it and resent it and he was chairman of
the shop committee was yes he was able to

191
00:16:48,04 --> 00:16:48,55
it's

192
00:16:48,55 --> 00:16:52,44
a must. Down there but he wasn't he wasn't
in the ironworkers you know he was in

193
00:16:52,44 --> 00:16:55,37
the blacksmith's so i think he was
chairman of the shop committee. Yes that's

194
00:16:55,37 --> 00:17:01,14
probably what it was yeah yeah you know i
didn't go into it that it's that in those

195
00:17:01,14 --> 00:17:05,41
days but when i talk about taste and
everything else like that. Well i've got

196
00:17:05,41 --> 00:17:10,17
a scene. Do you remember the secretary of
the un workers union colin tanner telling

197
00:17:10,17 --> 00:17:12,91
colin ten. Yes oh yes he was around for

198
00:17:12,91 --> 00:17:19,83
a long time it was george doc file. Page
intakes and everything. I don't know

199
00:17:19,83 --> 00:17:26,72
it was from. I don't know scotland
but yeah yeah. Oh yes i remember

200
00:17:26,72 --> 00:17:33,43
him well i don't know whether. But i thought
to say that him i think there might

201
00:17:33,43 --> 00:17:34,51
have been no there was

202
00:17:34,51 --> 00:17:41,32
a communist in between him and lied
to it after that. You member any

203
00:17:41,32 --> 00:17:46,00
other union meetings you member your member
being meeting being chaired by arthur

204
00:17:46,00 --> 00:17:52,88
riordan anyway and the only one
i really remembered was the one

205
00:17:52,88 --> 00:17:58,43
that when they decided on the second renzetti
stop work type of thing to have to go

206
00:17:58,43 --> 00:18:03,96
on the much. But beyond that i didn't
attend any talk now do you know you know

207
00:18:03,96 --> 00:18:09,85
there was much union disputation you know
i don't remember much at all. Really.

208
00:18:11,80 --> 00:18:17,11
No one incident i can think about.
Jimmy devereaux he used to be

209
00:18:17,11 --> 00:18:23,100
a champion footballer and
he worked inside and so on.

210
00:18:24,33 --> 00:18:31,23
Way way line put the fabricated stuff put
it in the heavy shop to be finished off.

211
00:18:32,18 --> 00:18:36,79
It simply was putting less than we all
just have to go in and help them down and

212
00:18:36,80 --> 00:18:41,48
they had a deck of those plates
telling about their high and i have

213
00:18:41,48 --> 00:18:47,20
a line came like that. Jimmy god damn jimmy
tween that i think you asked i think i

214
00:18:47,20 --> 00:18:49,02
tell. Toby ill for

215
00:18:49,02 --> 00:18:55,74
a long time but he and i then
do you remember any plates

216
00:18:55,74 --> 00:19:00,13
being that were already drilled coming
through off the ships that were you know

217
00:19:00,13 --> 00:19:06,46
ready to now and i don't
remember any coming off. Now now

218
00:19:07,18 --> 00:19:13,71
. Practically everything that came off
on our crane. We used to have to have

219
00:19:13,71 --> 00:19:20,71
a scraper to get the id numbers on
them clear that show. I think was

220
00:19:20,71 --> 00:19:25,21
it. Rusty very little i never
saw much stress it all

221
00:19:25,21 --> 00:19:31,63
a coating of very sticky stuff but
i don't remember much rest at all.

222
00:19:32,69 --> 00:19:32,99
So it was

223
00:19:32,99 --> 00:19:36,99
a sticky stuff you were cleaning off not
rusty just just to look at the at the

224
00:19:36,99 --> 00:19:43,98
number so that the stock takers could
identify it and do you remember any

225
00:19:43,98 --> 00:19:50,19
as a ute. Did you unload the bearings.
I had laid out a lot of bearings and

226
00:19:50,19 --> 00:19:56,26
a lot of things we unloaded all the
cables they were in coils of eight and

227
00:19:56,26 --> 00:20:03,22
a half ton and i could remember they had
two hundred and sixteen strands and they

228
00:20:03,22 --> 00:20:10,20
were the ones that held the arts in
suspension of the the bit the bearing

229
00:20:10,93 --> 00:20:16,03
. Marines came in parts they would be
already drilled wouldnt they. Oh you're

230
00:20:16,03 --> 00:20:20,84
talking about the big berries at the base
of the parlance. Well i don't remember i

231
00:20:20,84 --> 00:20:23,77
don't remember whether we took them
off. I think they might have been

232
00:20:23,77 --> 00:20:29,24
a bit too heavy for our crane. So the
bearings that you were dealing with would be

233
00:20:29,24 --> 00:20:34,20
deliberately for the for the approach
spans. Well yes i mean they wouldn't be. I

234
00:20:34,20 --> 00:20:37,38
don't think they'd be big enough and you
know i don't know what part of the bridge

235
00:20:37,38 --> 00:20:40,66
. They went on but i don't think they've
been big enough. So there was lots of

236
00:20:40,66 --> 00:20:47,44
stuff in. Inwood all also
that we unloaded to you see i

237
00:20:47,44 --> 00:20:52,20
had. Everybody that worked in the workshops
reckoned that they did all the work of

238
00:20:52,20 --> 00:20:55,85
drilling and processing all the steel.
Whereas the some people in middlesbrough

239
00:20:55,85 --> 00:21:01,100
reckoned that they spent years drilling
repetition pieces and i just trying to

240
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,67
absorb stablish whether the repetition
pieces were in fact used in the bridge or

241
00:21:06,67 --> 00:21:11,35
whether they were some other job. Well i
believe some other job because i don't

242
00:21:11,35 --> 00:21:17,15
recollect any any drill stuff coming
out at all. And i remembered it was

243
00:21:17,15 --> 00:21:21,20
a set up was right through the light shop
there. And as a matter fact one chap had

244
00:21:21,20 --> 00:21:26,14
a nasty accident there i believe he slept
as he pulled the drill down and it got

245
00:21:26,14 --> 00:21:30,58
him down the bottom of the some of our
shells timely that he lost one testicle over

246
00:21:30,58 --> 00:21:34,67
that. Yeah well that was
seven hours you know he was

247
00:21:34,67 --> 00:21:39,05
a dog man on the gantry cranes and you know
as you mentioned you know marley that's

248
00:21:39,05 --> 00:21:43,94
just struck a chord now. Yeah.
Yes he is he was very fortunate

249
00:21:45,24 --> 00:21:51,71
a horrible damn thing to happen. And
apparently he was. Well he managed to father

250
00:21:51,71 --> 00:21:53,95
my children up to its
head was good. It was

251
00:21:53,95 --> 00:21:59,25
a rough ride one. Yeah. Is
it was i believe there was

252
00:21:59,25 --> 00:22:02,39
a number of accidents so what do
you do you hear of an accident to

253
00:22:02,39 --> 00:22:08,94
a swede by the name of peterson. No i
don't remember that one. I remember

254
00:22:08,94 --> 00:22:13,89
one on the other side of the bridge. You
know these that all train type things that

255
00:22:13,89 --> 00:22:18,74
run on a chain. You can my man can lift

256
00:22:18,74 --> 00:22:24,100
a fair way for them to change. Yeah well
this fellow i think he finally fell on the

257
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,90
other side on the southern side. We only
heard about it. They finally came down to

258
00:22:29,90 --> 00:22:34,51
the end of the chain turned up again and
he lost his grip and fell and then it was

259
00:22:34,51 --> 00:22:37,13
much you and mature it
was and then there was

260
00:22:37,13 --> 00:22:43,27
a fellow named kelly i think that lived was
it. Kelly that. Is vic kelly that was i

261
00:22:43,27 --> 00:22:47,42
didn't know him because most of those fellows
were up on that on the bridge itself

262
00:22:47,42 --> 00:22:48,99
. You know he was

263
00:22:48,99 --> 00:22:53,82
a point to make it. He fell in the water
off the deck and he survived he came back

264
00:22:53,82 --> 00:22:54,97
to work a couple of weeks later

265
00:22:56,11 --> 00:23:02,80
a couple of weeks but they came early
got was. I think two broken ribs.

266
00:23:02,93 --> 00:23:06,17
Yeah. Goodness incredible

267
00:23:09,94 --> 00:23:16,61
. I. I don't know i know their
names i can know i remember the

268
00:23:16,61 --> 00:23:20,84
names of the fellers that worked out there
with me there. My driver crying driver

269
00:23:20,84 --> 00:23:27,39
was said loud and my offsider i had to was
name sanderson he was from middlesbrough

270
00:23:27,39 --> 00:23:31,14
. And the other one was a fellow
named johnny musher he was

271
00:23:31,14 --> 00:23:32,48
a french-canadian and i think

272
00:23:32,48 --> 00:23:37,87
a brother in law. Jimmy chilvers. I never
ever sure about that but he taught me

273
00:23:37,87 --> 00:23:38,20
quite

274
00:23:38,20 --> 00:23:42,95
a lot about the rigging business because
he he sailed before the mast. You know

275
00:23:42,95 --> 00:23:49,86
before he came and settled in australia.
So he he did some things that thrives

276
00:23:49,86 --> 00:23:55,37
and things and things like that. I never
even seen you know. So he helped me out in

277
00:23:55,37 --> 00:24:00,41
that particular part of it although i would
still be hands on on the business. He

278
00:24:00,41 --> 00:24:00,53
was

279
00:24:00,53 --> 00:24:08,03
a leading player by and because i
started before him and there was jack

280
00:24:08,03 --> 00:24:14,49
welch it was the other trying to over.
He was from england and eric wilson was

281
00:24:15,46 --> 00:24:19,48
against a crane driver and he was

282
00:24:19,48 --> 00:24:26,11
a football packed wilson. Here's the thing
he had in hand up to its face like that

283
00:24:27,05 --> 00:24:33,94
and how the event and then saying
he would tell you did you was

284
00:24:33,94 --> 00:24:39,78
this lunch stuff or was it up the pub it
hydrocarbon the turnouts you know. We're

285
00:24:39,78 --> 00:24:44,35
just to have football turned out and
things like that. We used to train up at

286
00:24:44,35 --> 00:24:50,79
university park and phil and
i'm vince it was the captain

287
00:24:52,42 --> 00:24:53,50
and then since i was

288
00:24:53,50 --> 00:25:00,45
a top cricket it was this rugby
league was it or yeah. Oh yes we

289
00:25:00,45 --> 00:25:07,45
had been back guernsey same as north because
it was this time when low grade normal

290
00:25:07,45 --> 00:25:14,23
. And i was tooth very started
the fire brigades and

291
00:25:14,23 --> 00:25:21,20
almost i can't remember any more and
mascaras by in places like that that i

292
00:25:21,20 --> 00:25:23,31
did that i believe

293
00:25:23,31 --> 00:25:29,11
a figure was in use and try and kind and
why i think. Everything else like that.

294
00:25:29,23 --> 00:25:34,19
Richard dislocation. But i went back to
work too soon. That just came back again.

295
00:25:35,14 --> 00:25:41,62
But then that my head was
there any other sort of

296
00:25:41,62 --> 00:25:45,79
well i mean the power from the football and
the outings with the football was there

297
00:25:45,79 --> 00:25:51,49
any other social things. You know not really
remember who was there as people care

298
00:25:51,49 --> 00:25:57,61
over there you know i don't in those days
i don't think i used to bet on horses.

299
00:25:58,86 --> 00:26:03,84
You learn your lesson with the crowd
america but i suppose so. But no i didn't

300
00:26:03,84 --> 00:26:10,49
really take to horse racing and
in the early days you know. But i

301
00:26:10,49 --> 00:26:12,72
can't remember the osprey book at all in

302
00:26:12,72 --> 00:26:16,77
a way he would have been betting in
sixpences and and or exact and then as

303
00:26:16,77 --> 00:26:23,66
a society. Finally amalfi still alive
an over interview to be less he

304
00:26:23,66 --> 00:26:27,58
married one of the waterhouse ladies who
had run the pub up here. Yeah it was like

305
00:26:27,58 --> 00:26:32,98
they had the pub on the way down to where
lerner park entrance is now that the

306
00:26:32,98 --> 00:26:36,81
imperialism. Or you'd have to ask the
locals for that i can't remember.

307
00:26:40,03 --> 00:26:43,58
We used to go over to circular
quay when we knocked off there was

308
00:26:43,58 --> 00:26:47,36
a race to jump off the ferries
it was a key part two and

309
00:26:47,36 --> 00:26:53,67
a cuttable i can remember and i was one
of those they are ringing in the still on

310
00:26:53,67 --> 00:26:58,95
the rail and jumped onto the wharf. Has
to be first out through the turnstile

311
00:27:00,02 --> 00:27:02,01
stupid when you come to
take me i can look back

312
00:27:02,01 --> 00:27:05,92
a bit because i tell you what i was
fairly athletic and i said jump

313
00:27:05,92 --> 00:27:12,81
a long way to be first
of no prizes. No prizes.

314
00:27:16,20 --> 00:27:21,51
Do you remember the names of the people
who were brought up from england for the

315
00:27:21,51 --> 00:27:23,82
doorman longs to remember any
of them. I can remember quite

316
00:27:23,82 --> 00:27:30,78
a few there was henry and our
martin brothers and had some sort

317
00:27:30,78 --> 00:27:30,97
of

318
00:27:30,97 --> 00:27:35,94
a turnout i can't remember just what the
kasian was but he was. Addressing quite

319
00:27:35,94 --> 00:27:41,73
a few of us and he said as soon as this
bridge is finished. They should start

320
00:27:41,73 --> 00:27:46,67
constructing another one because this one
will be i think the word was inadequate

321
00:27:47,89 --> 00:27:47,98
in

322
00:27:47,99 --> 00:27:54,94
a very short time and of course that's been
proved very right. I can remember. A fellow

323
00:27:54,94 --> 00:27:57,02
named patterson who was

324
00:27:57,02 --> 00:28:03,96
a scot and he was one of the best spoken
men i've ever listened to. He has

325
00:28:03,96 --> 00:28:09,07
to bring people. I think it was the architect
used to bring people around and we

326
00:28:09,07 --> 00:28:13,94
could hear me explaining this and the other
thing to all these people and it was

327
00:28:13,94 --> 00:28:18,78
a joy to listen to him talk.
You know and i think there was

328
00:28:18,78 --> 00:28:22,05
a little field who i think was

329
00:28:22,05 --> 00:28:28,15
a department by roads and folks he seemed
to carry on afterwards. He was public

330
00:28:28,15 --> 00:28:32,40
works during the but he was inspector
he was actually his title was resident

331
00:28:32,40 --> 00:28:36,01
engineer for the public works department
and that's why we saw so much of him and i

332
00:28:36,01 --> 00:28:41,30
thought he must have been because he went
to say the god of the dam later. Yes but

333
00:28:41,30 --> 00:28:46,70
of course the public bridge department was
finished with the bridge and there was

334
00:28:46,70 --> 00:28:51,61
an arrangement made to transfer some of
the engineers or most of the engineers to

335
00:28:52,36 --> 00:28:54,61
to the main roads. I mean
actual fact there was

336
00:28:54,61 --> 00:29:01,53
a deal between bradfield and the new
all of the of the main roads board. To

337
00:29:01,54 --> 00:29:05,13
take the men and that's how they got the
bridge to do you mark got the bridge

338
00:29:05,13 --> 00:29:09,44
rather than the railways. I
say so. Yes and there was

339
00:29:11,89 --> 00:29:14,11
among those of course rest of ennis

340
00:29:14,11 --> 00:29:19,89
a big. Very bulky man and he was

341
00:29:19,89 --> 00:29:26,36
a kingpin i was there the day that i joined
up the medevac we all got to canberra

342
00:29:26,36 --> 00:29:32,52
flown which i spent and he said keeping
for all these years and i think they

343
00:29:32,52 --> 00:29:37,38
actually knocked us off its three o'clock
that day the day the bridge was it but it

344
00:29:37,38 --> 00:29:43,06
was fascinating. Just to watch that business
take place because we could almost see

345
00:29:43,06 --> 00:29:47,63
the bridge doing that you know and then of
course the great cheer that went up and

346
00:29:48,49 --> 00:29:52,09
. Terry's total goodness knows
what not a great. It was

347
00:29:52,09 --> 00:29:58,22
a great day. Really not my respect because
when i was there it hurried up my

348
00:29:59,10 --> 00:30:03,92
getting put up. Well i lasted long and now
because i swung the decking probably i

349
00:30:03,92 --> 00:30:10,26
chaffed and then. It was our
mother a me double t i t he was

350
00:30:10,26 --> 00:30:12,03
a former he was

351
00:30:12,03 --> 00:30:18,28
a two mill middles were banned i
think and what he looked like. Well

352
00:30:19,41 --> 00:30:25,09
now i can see him you know very it would.
It wouldn't be any bigger than me. He had

353
00:30:25,09 --> 00:30:31,86
a big pinky type takes pale
eyes and not fair here.
