1
00:00:06,72 --> 00:00:07,91
I'm speaking to mr.

2
00:00:07,91 --> 00:00:09,80
e h a Peach who was

3
00:00:09,80 --> 00:00:15,06
a public works engineer on
the harbour bridge with dr.

4
00:00:15,06 --> 00:00:20,42
Bradfield you remember those times
do you speech. Yes. We're taking

5
00:00:20,43 --> 00:00:25,65
a back in the first instance where were you
born and when i was born in this is all

6
00:00:25,65 --> 00:00:31,78
one night in hundred to sort all of these
and. And when did you come out here. You

7
00:00:31,78 --> 00:00:38,75
came out here not in certina. With your
parents with your parents. Oh yes yes but

8
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:46,46
our family came our virtually the same time.
You member coming out. So yes we came

9
00:00:46,46 --> 00:00:46,74
out on

10
00:00:46,74 --> 00:00:52,45
a ceramic i'll have my voice and when we
do we use school school age at those days

11
00:00:52,45 --> 00:00:58,81
. Yes which is also the primary
school nationally. Then.

12
00:01:01,38 --> 00:01:08,03
We go to them. How to canterbury canterbury
you know after canterbury our went to

13
00:01:08,03 --> 00:01:14,08
manly public school and from there i went
to cleveland strange. Public school so

14
00:01:14,08 --> 00:01:21,06
high school. And what then.
I just started work. Where

15
00:01:21,07 --> 00:01:25,18
was your first job then
with brothers in 1918 as

16
00:01:25,18 --> 00:01:31,46
a cadet. And i continued my studies for

17
00:01:31,47 --> 00:01:38,30
a number of years i would say until
mid 1920s principally in engineering

18
00:01:40,74 --> 00:01:46,40
and what job did you get after the draft
and job. Well my first job with the

19
00:01:46,40 --> 00:01:51,74
government was was the metropolitan
right i can suction when dr.

20
00:01:51,74 --> 00:01:57,71
Brand her loosely. The chief
engineer. And i was with them for.

21
00:02:02,17 --> 00:02:08,30
Until about nineteen twenty two twenty
three. I think it was and three or four of

22
00:02:08,30 --> 00:02:10,94
us were picked. To formally

23
00:02:10,94 --> 00:02:16,25
a national group that comprise
ultimately these they have

24
00:02:16,25 --> 00:02:20,13
a british branch. Do you ever first getting
the job with the public works do you.

25
00:02:20,18 --> 00:02:23,57
Oh yes yes. So my first job with

26
00:02:23,57 --> 00:02:30,47
a public works was in nineteen twenty
twenty one and middle lush who

27
00:02:30,47 --> 00:02:35,88
eventually one of the supervising engineers
out on the harm of range was employed

28
00:02:35,88 --> 00:02:42,82
at the same time. Both we were both in the
metro ride construction. Did he started

29
00:02:42,82 --> 00:02:49,53
the railways to yes. We you interviewed
first by dr bradfield or who

30
00:02:49,53 --> 00:02:56,11
took you on so to speak. I was taken on

31
00:02:56,11 --> 00:03:00,50
by the metropolitan right away. Construction.
I was interviewed by some committee

32
00:03:00,50 --> 00:03:07,43
and that's where my first appointment.
When did you first meet redfield or

33
00:03:09,29 --> 00:03:14,72
shortly after i joined i magine they joined
the rats borrower construction. Jeremy

34
00:03:14,73 --> 00:03:19,63
the office in those days where it was. It
was in the public works department or my

35
00:03:19,64 --> 00:03:26,48
third floor. And they were all
draftsmen there weren't many

36
00:03:26,48 --> 00:03:31,94
engineers as such in those days because.
Engineering work on the metropolitan right

37
00:03:31,94 --> 00:03:38,40
construction had barely been started. I
think what i can recall you member any of

38
00:03:38,40 --> 00:03:41,87
the political hoo ha and getting the reg
going again getting there getting the

39
00:03:41,87 --> 00:03:46,96
railways going again. The metropolitan
railway construction had been in abeyance.

40
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,83
Yes i know there was some trouble about
it was some potent political levering at

41
00:03:51,83 --> 00:03:56,68
the time but i was really too young
to worry much about it and there's

42
00:03:56,68 --> 00:04:03,23
a. Can i take you back to the time
when you were actually working in the

43
00:04:03,23 --> 00:04:07,69
drawing office. At the metropolitan railway
construction branch you meant what your

44
00:04:07,69 --> 00:04:14,37
job was and what you did well at that
time it was principally railway line the

45
00:04:14,37 --> 00:04:20,46
calculations dealing with right away. Local
city railway locations. The method of

46
00:04:21,74 --> 00:04:24,85
mobile occasion work it had
been developed work done on

47
00:04:24,85 --> 00:04:31,38
a grid system and you had to relate. The
whole of the railway line the center line

48
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:39,97
to one fixed point which on this
occasion was there was the time ball on

49
00:04:39,97 --> 00:04:45,65
the observatory that was that was the
heart and no more no more and then

50
00:04:47,10 --> 00:04:53,18
and from that point every position on the
since almost thirty railway could be

51
00:04:53,18 --> 00:04:58,45
determined by magically so you had no
problems and in doing just exactly where any

52
00:04:58,45 --> 00:05:03,71
part of the railway came in relation to
the buildings or the offsets. It was

53
00:05:03,71 --> 00:05:07,89
because of this. I think principally that
i was transferred to the harbour bridge

54
00:05:09,38 --> 00:05:14,23
design people to do the same thing
on the harbour bridge and has it has

55
00:05:14,23 --> 00:05:21,02
a result of that all awry well okay some
work on both approaches to the bridge was

56
00:05:21,02 --> 00:05:27,28
worked out this time. As time went on. Do
you remember the surveyor did you have

57
00:05:27,28 --> 00:05:32,75
anything to do with him. Mr amphlett yes
i've got an old tape of it. Up on my shit

58
00:05:32,75 --> 00:05:38,07
. Once it was discarded whole thing collapse
later on. Yes i knew very well i guess

59
00:05:38,07 --> 00:05:43,61
the right. Factor is to be one of his
party. Yes. Do you where do you do you

60
00:05:43,61 --> 00:05:49,89
remember where his name sort of slippery
came from. Now i don't doubt it.

61
00:05:50,85 --> 00:05:55,23
There are some people do call it slippery
and flip over at my he may have got that

62
00:05:55,23 --> 00:06:02,01
from his early in his earlier. Surveying
work. I doubt he was now i don't remember

63
00:06:02,01 --> 00:06:03,38
any he was

64
00:06:03,38 --> 00:06:09,53
a pretty decent sort of grey head lice
line fairly. And my principal job was to

65
00:06:09,53 --> 00:06:09,70
help

66
00:06:09,70 --> 00:06:16,22
a measure of the baselines for the harbor
bridge. This was done in the quarry scene

67
00:06:16,22 --> 00:06:22,19
down along the eastern side street
somewhere between much library and the

68
00:06:22,19 --> 00:06:26,02
government house. I saw one baseline was
in the government has garden and there's

69
00:06:26,02 --> 00:06:30,61
the governor peering through the theodolite.
Well i don't know what he did in those

70
00:06:30,61 --> 00:06:37,15
days. His name was the share the
chair in those days and i tried.

71
00:06:38,99 --> 00:06:43,57
But did you go out with with amphlett or
mr amphlett or did you just work for him

72
00:06:43,57 --> 00:06:47,95
in the office. I don't know how i feel i
work with him. I'm trying to time you

73
00:06:47,95 --> 00:06:53,49
transfer different job you're doing all in
might get some assistance. And when you

74
00:06:53,49 --> 00:06:57,92
went over to the bridge. Do you remember
was it different. The work of the work you

75
00:06:57,92 --> 00:07:02,89
were doing from the city really not it's
not significantly not an issue then right

76
00:07:02,89 --> 00:07:03,16
. It was

77
00:07:03,16 --> 00:07:10,80
a name an invention even but i know it
especially this harp member when particularly

78
00:07:11,57 --> 00:07:17,34
. The original design for the appraised
sydney harbour bridge. It was two tracks

79
00:07:18,69 --> 00:07:24,98
. On one side and now. It was four tracks
together two went round the observatory.

80
00:07:26,04 --> 00:07:32,09
And along parallel to kent street and the
other two went almost directly down onto

81
00:07:32,09 --> 00:07:37,68
when you station that of course was later
on. It was all because later on they had

82
00:07:37,68 --> 00:07:42,34
a big bold plans looked as they
were bar constructed and small as

83
00:07:42,34 --> 00:07:48,18
a great began. And there were two great big
boulders in the tracks so g eventually

84
00:07:48,18 --> 00:07:53,71
can do is when you got enter to win sation
it's all now cause. Do you remember when

85
00:07:53,71 --> 00:07:59,11
he scrapped all the plans for the railway
at that particular time i understand that

86
00:07:59,11 --> 00:08:06,02
in order to do that he had to change to
be the maximum gradient of the railway

87
00:08:06,02 --> 00:08:11,85
and also. Motors electric motors and all
the sort of thing came into yes yes to the

88
00:08:11,85 --> 00:08:13,20
matter fact that what about quite

89
00:08:13,20 --> 00:08:18,11
a big change because the national
requirement by the railway department is

90
00:08:18,11 --> 00:08:22,19
a maximum rate of one in thirty and because
of that it was impossible to get off

91
00:08:22,19 --> 00:08:29,07
the bridge down to when you station the lay
of the level required and. This caused

92
00:08:29,07 --> 00:08:33,15
a great in this is one reason only. Why
they put the ball is to get the additional

93
00:08:33,85 --> 00:08:38,49
travelling distance so i can decrease
again. But right my department and i don't

94
00:08:38,49 --> 00:08:44,48
know who or why or how something issued
and edicts of their maximum guide will be

95
00:08:44,48 --> 00:08:50,05
one in thirty which completely altered
the design of both the approach and

96
00:08:50,05 --> 00:08:54,46
approaches on both sides. I heard it was
bradfield that did it but i don't know.

97
00:08:54,67 --> 00:08:58,38
Well it could well have went because over.
I wouldn't have noticed i wouldn't have

98
00:08:58,38 --> 00:08:59,64
known really and those

99
00:08:59,64 --> 00:09:06,54
a but i really told us from now on it
was one and one of thirty. I believe

100
00:09:06,54 --> 00:09:06,83
there was

101
00:09:06,83 --> 00:09:09,83
a bit of an internal battle which i've
been trying to find out about between

102
00:09:09,83 --> 00:09:13,05
a deejay faust who had
previously worked for dr.

103
00:09:13,05 --> 00:09:19,95
Bradfield in the email sea
reconstruction branch and bradfield

104
00:09:19,95 --> 00:09:23,44
himself who. He never became

105
00:09:23,44 --> 00:09:27,12
a rally commission actually wasn't his
thing but but forced to became a rower for

106
00:09:27,12 --> 00:09:29,50
a mission. And i believe it was a bit of

107
00:09:29,50 --> 00:09:32,19
a battle between the two of them. You
never heard anything about it you know i

108
00:09:32,19 --> 00:09:38,63
wasn't aware of it. It was the argument
was over the rolling stock over the motor

109
00:09:38,63 --> 00:09:42,10
sissy was there i consider trains used to
get stuck on the way on the uphill there

110
00:09:42,10 --> 00:09:48,78
. Now i want to wear that hat. You're
telling me i think. I do you know your room

111
00:09:48,78 --> 00:09:48,89
as

112
00:09:48,89 --> 00:09:54,88
a slam try to get some substance. Now i
don't really know you know well back to the

113
00:09:54,88 --> 00:09:56,49
foster's name i remember him as

114
00:09:56,49 --> 00:10:02,75
a commissioner or in the way of any. Any
friction between he and rang for him.

115
00:10:03,75 --> 00:10:09,60
Do you how did you get on with dr if you.
I got on very well and is nothing but he

116
00:10:09,61 --> 00:10:12,84
was a delightful person who really took

117
00:10:12,84 --> 00:10:19,02
a real human interest and staff and quite
easy to get on and he he required.

118
00:10:19,08 --> 00:10:24,95
One thing he did you call them fleet likely
more to the to the job and to the and.

119
00:10:24,97 --> 00:10:31,50
And to the touch of rational himself any
editor gresham's away from that then

120
00:10:31,50 --> 00:10:38,05
you've had a cell somewhere else.
Like what. Oh well i had it is

121
00:10:38,06 --> 00:10:42,96
a bit like new you had and i kneel when
he was chief commissioner finished out in

122
00:10:42,96 --> 00:10:46,83
the midwest in the midwest
always to vision.

123
00:10:50,58 --> 00:10:55,64
In many ways it. It was often claimed that
redfield sort of centralized everything

124
00:10:55,64 --> 00:11:01,47
through himself he took the credit for
everything he did you ever did he ever give

125
00:11:01,47 --> 00:11:06,25
you credit for you or your work
or. Yes he did very much so as

126
00:11:06,25 --> 00:11:13,20
a matter of fact part. Later on when
the bridge was well established.

127
00:11:13,21 --> 00:11:19,41
But in order to retain the enthusiasm
forward. He was giving lectures here there

128
00:11:19,41 --> 00:11:26,03
and everywhere and he is i use them right.
So i had lectures for him and. Bill.

129
00:11:26,48 --> 00:11:31,23
Who was also a friend of mine.
He was my boss as well. He was

130
00:11:31,23 --> 00:11:38,17
a supervising engineer would.
Wound and get things straight

131
00:11:38,17 --> 00:11:42,88
arranged election wasn't and want to know
more than one occasion suggested perhaps

132
00:11:42,88 --> 00:11:48,99
and. I should much like ask my
mother i was not around then

133
00:11:49,92 --> 00:11:55,42
and from my and one i stay in on the prep
because he knew my mother was in the in

134
00:11:55,42 --> 00:12:00,97
the audience he specifically my in the
direct you know reference to me and the

135
00:12:00,97 --> 00:12:04,22
plain guard of the
preparation and the really

136
00:12:04,22 --> 00:12:10,82
a lot of the the the letter brit lecture
itself but also some of the little

137
00:12:10,82 --> 00:12:12,43
stations which i felt was

138
00:12:12,43 --> 00:12:17,19
a very clearly. Oh he was very he was
very much like he looked after my mother

139
00:12:17,19 --> 00:12:22,55
later on there was. Oh we hadn't opened

140
00:12:22,55 --> 00:12:26,87
a bridge at that stage but there were one
or two little ceremonies which used to

141
00:12:26,87 --> 00:12:30,95
rise for instance. Saturday afternoon the
first time over the bridge. It always

142
00:12:30,95 --> 00:12:37,04
sort of is. My mother's ought to
go on. Well that was very good

143
00:12:39,01 --> 00:12:40,16
. It was

144
00:12:40,16 --> 00:12:46,08
a personal touch as i understand. When you
were. Well what was your job actually on

145
00:12:46,08 --> 00:12:52,52
the. The design of the bitch. Surely it
was right or railway construction but

146
00:12:53,95 --> 00:12:58,49
i was a bit mathematically
in sign and ice to do

147
00:12:58,49 --> 00:13:05,09
a lot of math on them and. I. Had

148
00:13:05,09 --> 00:13:11,37
a number of jobs today. Generally we
design work the bits here and bits their

149
00:13:12,24 --> 00:13:19,23
design the the. The tiny holes on the

150
00:13:19,23 --> 00:13:25,99
south side. Over a matter fact i think
the national idea of a bridge on

151
00:13:25,99 --> 00:13:26,36
a bridge

152
00:13:26,36 --> 00:13:33,38
a ride. I'll cut as was originally
suggested by me as far as i can recall how

153
00:13:33,39 --> 00:13:34,42
do you explain that the bridge on

154
00:13:34,42 --> 00:13:40,85
a bridge over the algo had well you see.
In the redesign of the southern approach

155
00:13:42,29 --> 00:13:48,75
it was essential to have the roadway here
above the railway by the time it got down

156
00:13:48,75 --> 00:13:55,73
to down to the song to the sun in the
contact. That's very close to i go and

157
00:13:57,42 --> 00:14:04,21
cut. Now when you reached cut south.
You'd have the railway level below

158
00:14:05,88 --> 00:14:12,17
the road level. So you know to carry the
two over. Not as they would. Couldn't you

159
00:14:12,17 --> 00:14:17,35
couldn't keep one level you had to do
something on the road i stuck another bridge

160
00:14:17,35 --> 00:14:22,30
up on the i'm allowed bridge put the right
way out there and left the right way

161
00:14:22,30 --> 00:14:25,59
down low. I didn't realise
so when you look up

162
00:14:25,59 --> 00:14:31,31
a cut above you. There are always running
over that. I yes there i will. Well yes

163
00:14:31,31 --> 00:14:34,88
yes it will and those days
before later on. It was changed

164
00:14:34,88 --> 00:14:41,46
a bit the tramways are on the west's
only sign no worse they start

165
00:14:42,55 --> 00:14:47,95
a site and the railway was only

166
00:14:47,95 --> 00:14:53,61
a western side and i never thought of that
when you come to use it. It's toll gate

167
00:14:53,61 --> 00:14:54,17
so i was

168
00:14:54,17 --> 00:15:00,45
a number of steps there and leading up
from there from the air and ground level

169
00:15:00,45 --> 00:15:07,07
that i go down as i go straight and
sell all watch together. And eventually

170
00:15:07,07 --> 00:15:12,84
you know how there were levels footpath
levels on both the east and the western

171
00:15:12,84 --> 00:15:19,51
side and the harbor bridge right on the
western side also hand access to endorse

172
00:15:20,38 --> 00:15:25,75
the observatory park. And do you have
anything to do with the design of the

173
00:15:25,75 --> 00:15:31,70
approaches on the northern side. I did the
whole layout there virtually both the

174
00:15:31,70 --> 00:15:37,99
railway stations how the railways and
then slowly work satiated of the roadway.

175
00:15:39,20 --> 00:15:41,35
You have anything to do
with mr. Ledger and mr.

176
00:15:41,35 --> 00:15:45,63
Boyd. Yes not so much
slimmer sledger but mr.

177
00:15:45,63 --> 00:15:50,57
Boyd oh yes he was in charge of the drawing
office when i was only there the best

178
00:15:50,57 --> 00:15:53,11
one right. I can sanction the ledger was

179
00:15:53,11 --> 00:15:58,01
a it was earlier he was designing engineer
and fausto when forced it was his

180
00:15:58,01 --> 00:16:02,41
principal designing engineer for the
railways for bradfield. So that'll be before

181
00:16:02,41 --> 00:16:08,55
your time. But boyd. So i can remember
honestly he was a slight man with

182
00:16:08,55 --> 00:16:12,78
a gray hair i mean obviously. And
i can recall he was basically

183
00:16:12,78 --> 00:16:19,28
a surveyor as well as any i could have
sons went on to surveying and they had

184
00:16:19,28 --> 00:16:25,32
a surveying business in town. I don't know.
And on the north side. What were the

185
00:16:25,32 --> 00:16:31,73
problems there. Not
very many really it was

186
00:16:31,73 --> 00:16:38,32
a fairly straightforward job. You know the
principal difficulty arose there was the

187
00:16:38,32 --> 00:16:44,36
difference. In length of the bridge
by survey the length of the bridge by

188
00:16:44,36 --> 00:16:51,12
construction and they didn't mean. No they
british from memory i think bridge was

189
00:16:51,12 --> 00:16:58,03
a bit longer than the survey was a result
you had to get rid of about or remember

190
00:16:58,04 --> 00:17:00,45
a five or six inches which was

191
00:17:00,45 --> 00:17:06,56
a very accurately term and simply because
if you built them where where the matter

192
00:17:06,56 --> 00:17:09,34
fact there was a. There was a bit of

193
00:17:09,34 --> 00:17:12,88
a problem there because they had work
to an earlier survey which are nearly

194
00:17:12,88 --> 00:17:16,26
a distance across the harbour
bridge and started to build

195
00:17:16,26 --> 00:17:23,08
a museum station some of all city
station and then when hanford. And

196
00:17:23,86 --> 00:17:23,99
done

197
00:17:23,99 --> 00:17:28,10
a very accurate survey with instruments
brought in low especially in some was brought

198
00:17:28,10 --> 00:17:35,07
in from the jail from
overseas and. He measured

199
00:17:35,07 --> 00:17:39,74
the same just same distance between what
is known as being in which is benchmark

200
00:17:39,74 --> 00:17:42,37
north and bed. And p.s.

201
00:17:42,37 --> 00:17:45,76
Which is benchmark south. And there was

202
00:17:45,76 --> 00:17:50,99
a cybersex each is different and levels
i straightaway the bridge work had been

203
00:17:50,99 --> 00:17:57,21
started on the harbour bridge. Work it
been started on one or certainly preached

204
00:17:57,21 --> 00:18:03,85
construction and in the ultimate they would
went. So. That i how much by how much

205
00:18:03,85 --> 00:18:09,67
five or six inches. That was i just
forget it was both edges out more

206
00:18:11,05 --> 00:18:17,17
in the north south direction and
it was east and west and i had

207
00:18:18,25 --> 00:18:19,27
the difficult job on

208
00:18:19,27 --> 00:18:25,23
a difficult deliberately of getting rid of
five inches of real estate which we know

209
00:18:25,23 --> 00:18:30,92
also there in south sydney. It's your
time. It was done. How did you do it

210
00:18:32,70 --> 00:18:39,64
. Oh calculations. Oh i where does the
federal count there's got to know you can

211
00:18:39,64 --> 00:18:43,52
fit all. I mean you can you can links

212
00:18:43,53 --> 00:18:50,07
a straight track you can trust came around
circular tracks it was quite so easy. We

213
00:18:50,07 --> 00:18:52,22
wish you can't make one circle fit on

214
00:18:52,22 --> 00:18:55,66
a low and accurately and these
have been thought of yes it was

215
00:18:55,66 --> 00:19:01,41
a really probably you to show me it
what they want to know. They do know

216
00:19:04,73 --> 00:19:09,08
. It would too short too long. I don't
know where that is now but we stretched it

217
00:19:10,03 --> 00:19:15,06
one way or the other. How did the error and
did anybody ever find out how the error

218
00:19:15,06 --> 00:19:19,31
originated or you never know. Noticed time
by two different surveyors and they gave

219
00:19:19,31 --> 00:19:26,29
two different answers. The other there was
there was no i. There was no doubt about

220
00:19:26,29 --> 00:19:27,08
that got

221
00:19:27,08 --> 00:19:30,85
a goodly and something out of me not about
it. Do you remember going out into the

222
00:19:30,85 --> 00:19:37,74
field at all and doing your own
surveying yes i know i am one time

223
00:19:37,74 --> 00:19:42,31
dr. Bradfield was very interested in
the development of the building of

224
00:19:42,31 --> 00:19:45,70
a row over tween the harbor
bridge and the manly ring

225
00:19:45,70 --> 00:19:52,30
a district. And i had the job of doing
the the initial location of the

226
00:19:52,30 --> 00:19:58,33
region and there was no he just it was

227
00:20:00,51 --> 00:20:02,89
a dope precise way but there was i gave

228
00:20:02,89 --> 00:20:08,13
a good general location which was
good enough. And as i was to

229
00:20:09,81 --> 00:20:15,42
find out just where the nature of the
railway were where the station for me and.

230
00:20:17,45 --> 00:20:23,86
I went out to do the survey. I didn't
do a detailed surveyors job. I did

231
00:20:23,86 --> 00:20:30,42
a general so i principally i'm levelling.
The make sure the level from from lost

232
00:20:30,43 --> 00:20:37,26
and me. Round three right up right
up the coast here and sorrows. Or

233
00:20:37,26 --> 00:20:43,98
i think there's something like that. I've
seen those surveys i didn't see your name

234
00:20:43,98 --> 00:20:49,88
on them now. No no i did in the track work.
Do you remember who you working under

235
00:20:49,88 --> 00:20:56,28
at that time polite

236
00:20:57,28 --> 00:20:59,49
polite. Is

237
00:20:59,50 --> 00:21:02,90
a couple of other service names as well.
During that i was i believe as far as i

238
00:21:02,90 --> 00:21:08,63
can see from the from the survey material
which i discovered in the. In the railway

239
00:21:08,63 --> 00:21:15,13
archives that we need station there that
there was about three surveys done and

240
00:21:15,13 --> 00:21:20,29
there are about three to separate routes
were proposed then does this was done very

241
00:21:20,29 --> 00:21:21,56
much as

242
00:21:21,57 --> 00:21:27,55
a deep metal no interest at all from the
royal wave. Well there was no evident

243
00:21:27,55 --> 00:21:32,31
interest in the right way to know when
they were wondering my c they've got the

244
00:21:32,31 --> 00:21:37,49
ones i've saw i saw of three separate
lights and their grave got an m.o.

245
00:21:37,49 --> 00:21:43,09
See no metropolitan railway construction
but no. Yes that'll be right. Do you

246
00:21:43,09 --> 00:21:49,05
remember the office up there and and
working up there and how how the

247
00:21:49,79 --> 00:21:53,81
layout was between the people working on
the metropole and now we construction

248
00:21:53,81 --> 00:21:57,36
branch and the people working on the harbour
bridge branch the different drawing

249
00:21:57,36 --> 00:22:03,20
officers know they were there with the
different groups within the same office. I

250
00:22:03,20 --> 00:22:09,29
was much more i can sanction the years.
Gemma i think about all the engineers that

251
00:22:09,29 --> 00:22:14,34
were working on the bridge getting fired
from the railways round about 1928. They

252
00:22:14,35 --> 00:22:18,88
all got fired by the railways. Because
the railways they were working on the

253
00:22:18,88 --> 00:22:24,51
harbour bridge under bradfield and they
were salaries were paid for and they were

254
00:22:24,51 --> 00:22:28,60
still working within the metropolitan really
construction of the 1920s and you were

255
00:22:28,60 --> 00:22:35,52
in 1928. There were all terminated from
the railways and it's very snotty comment

256
00:22:35,52 --> 00:22:39,14
appears on the record cards
which says. To be treated as

257
00:22:39,14 --> 00:22:44,03
a service is dispensed with.
That's right. I was on. I went

258
00:22:44,03 --> 00:22:49,98
a main road that. Oh yes very very unhappy
about that you member the politics of it

259
00:22:49,98 --> 00:22:56,48
. No i don't i know how
it came to this. I don't.

260
00:22:57,97 --> 00:22:58,32
Dr.

261
00:22:58,32 --> 00:23:05,28
Van fleet was always very loyal to
his staff. And this this switch

262
00:23:06,31 --> 00:23:12,28
the railways to the works
to underline his mind of

263
00:23:13,04 --> 00:23:17,83
mind. I've seen was engineered.
It was engineered between dr.

264
00:23:17,83 --> 00:23:24,78
Brand for you know i knew who
the role of the department

265
00:23:24,79 --> 00:23:31,66
might raise commissioner. It was down on
you scratch my back and ask rice yours

266
00:23:32,37 --> 00:23:39,37
and the deal was settled. I
believe my doctor by and feel

267
00:23:39,37 --> 00:23:45,20
sure. Knew or. That he could eventually

268
00:23:46,54 --> 00:23:53,23
take over my harbor bridge and its might
change if he would retain the main

269
00:23:54,02 --> 00:23:57,70
railway staff which was
done. It was there was

270
00:23:57,70 --> 00:24:02,38
a lot of trouble later on with runaway
staff going to main right. And they didn't

271
00:24:02,38 --> 00:24:03,63
get a very good sort of

272
00:24:03,63 --> 00:24:10,34
a reception. I was one of the victims i
think. That's how that was brought about i

273
00:24:10,34 --> 00:24:13,76
didn't know anybody knew about it. I
thought it was the other way around as

274
00:24:13,76 --> 00:24:19,13
a matter of fact i had completely misread
it in that case. What what i had thought

275
00:24:19,13 --> 00:24:21,74
was the case was that this well there was

276
00:24:21,74 --> 00:24:27,30
a infighting battle between fraser and
bradfield wish there was over well in the

277
00:24:27,30 --> 00:24:27,83
first but there's

278
00:24:27,83 --> 00:24:34,14
a long standing one fraser of course was
was railway commissioner supreme he was

279
00:24:34,14 --> 00:24:38,66
the he was the first so to speak. Do you
ever meet resit oh yes i meant friday

280
00:24:38,66 --> 00:24:44,53
afternoon after i left on my own right and
i was like. Oh i didn't have much to do

281
00:24:44,53 --> 00:24:49,64
with him here i mean you know i was on a
comedian and. He was there and he had

282
00:24:49,64 --> 00:24:50,87
a boy but frazier was

283
00:24:50,87 --> 00:24:55,32
a it was his son my demand that wouldn't
be that was his son who was on that

284
00:24:55,32 --> 00:24:59,56
committee that's right yes. Well it was
james fraser he was the old the old man who

285
00:24:59,56 --> 00:25:02,18
was always battling redfield and
he were always battling they had

286
00:25:02,18 --> 00:25:05,69
a certain respect for each other but they
were always battling when the harbour

287
00:25:05,69 --> 00:25:12,53
bridge was designs were first
brought out and the tender was.

288
00:25:12,55 --> 00:25:16,81
Bradfield had proposed to accept the tender
doorman long for an arch bridge with

289
00:25:16,81 --> 00:25:22,99
pylons and. James fraser
recommended without pylons.

290
00:25:24,09 --> 00:25:28,56
And then so it went on and then the
location also of the circular quay railway

291
00:25:29,59 --> 00:25:36,54
james fraser do everything that i did the
plans for. I didn't initially planned for

292
00:25:36,54 --> 00:25:40,71
the railway. The secular key railway station.
I don't know where they got it would

293
00:25:40,71 --> 00:25:46,56
i can well remember even now the outline
of these things which was for me there

294
00:25:46,56 --> 00:25:52,43
with all its light now. I expect but. Do
you remember who did the drawings for the

295
00:25:53,21 --> 00:25:57,24
architectural drawings coulter do you
remember him. Yes. Carla what was he like

296
00:25:57,24 --> 00:26:02,62
he's a very nice very he
was. He was narcotics he was

297
00:26:02,62 --> 00:26:09,50
a mean jinnie. He'd he'd ask for things.
Engineering virtually impossible. And

298
00:26:09,50 --> 00:26:13,80
then cleared them in these pictures and
expect wonder why they didn't look like the

299
00:26:13,80 --> 00:26:17,72
same as these pictures when they were
eventually built what we nationally was he

300
00:26:17,72 --> 00:26:23,20
was he as i wouldn't i would imagine he'd
been. Did it. What sort of accent did he

301
00:26:23,20 --> 00:26:26,80
have. I don't recall he had an accent in

302
00:26:26,81 --> 00:26:31,60
a neutral do i have an accent. Not
really because i'm feeling i've got

303
00:26:31,60 --> 00:26:33,35
a family when i was a hero here is not

304
00:26:33,35 --> 00:26:37,55
a neutral accent so he could have been
english or australian. How would think so

305
00:26:37,55 --> 00:26:43,46
yes. Do you know where he where he
went to return. Yes he would the

306
00:26:44,90 --> 00:26:50,41
government. Government i connect. Well he
was an architect with them all the way

307
00:26:50,41 --> 00:26:53,74
through and they used to his drawings
used to be done on that show they sent

308
00:26:53,74 --> 00:26:58,02
a voucher down here to the drawings that
may be but i'm not sure i don't know what

309
00:26:58,02 --> 00:27:03,14
happened after i left the harbor bridge.
But so you your engineering drawings

310
00:27:03,14 --> 00:27:09,08
hardly corresponded to what
his architectural drawings.

311
00:27:10,25 --> 00:27:17,22
I see issue here. Anything.
Like you know you know times

312
00:27:17,22 --> 00:27:21,30
when you've just got to do something. There's
no alternative but it didn't matter.

313
00:27:21,38 --> 00:27:25,08
He put a row of cottages between. Between

314
00:27:25,08 --> 00:27:31,31
a row royal i was about ten feet high and.
You couldn't do anything with it but. Do

315
00:27:31,31 --> 00:27:35,74
you remember him doing is drawing over
for her descriptions of him doing these

316
00:27:35,74 --> 00:27:40,96
drawings which are very very fine i've
been trying to remember him doing when

317
00:27:43,32 --> 00:27:49,70
he worked fast they were done. I don't
ever remember where he worked or gordon's

318
00:27:49,70 --> 00:27:53,64
doing or he worked on the architects. But
gordon stuckey says that he remembered

319
00:27:53,64 --> 00:27:54,07
him doing

320
00:27:54,76 --> 00:28:00,17
a drawing on one occasion with dr
bradfield was talking and this. This was

321
00:28:00,17 --> 00:28:05,87
a sort of general drawing for the town
hall stations entrances and. Bradfield was

322
00:28:05,87 --> 00:28:12,24
just talking and culture was drawing and
very very quickly what was done was

323
00:28:12,24 --> 00:28:15,59
required. I've seen that drawing and i
guess one of the most superb drawings i've

324
00:28:15,59 --> 00:28:16,65
ever seen of st.

325
00:28:16,65 --> 00:28:23,05
Andrew's cathedral. Yes. Can i don't know
i have to say i know i saw plenty of his

326
00:28:23,05 --> 00:28:24,51
sketches. I see him

327
00:28:24,51 --> 00:28:30,62
a lot of ways and. But. He used
to come up to your office to.

328
00:28:31,61 --> 00:28:36,62
Oh here probably be in the office whether
he'd come up and i have no idea where he

329
00:28:36,62 --> 00:28:41,55
worked was in the shed over the road down
below the government architects. That's

330
00:28:41,64 --> 00:28:48,04
right yes. Going over there some time.
Well do you remember the shed. Oh yes

331
00:28:48,89 --> 00:28:55,71
. Yes. You know the single story place. I
remember right. Well that's the stuff we

332
00:28:55,71 --> 00:28:55,89
have

333
00:28:55,89 --> 00:29:03,52
a that's where they do these exploration.
Now the early sites the site

334
00:29:03,53 --> 00:29:07,48
of the early government house yes yes yes
that's right. Some digging up there now.

335
00:29:07,52 --> 00:29:11,70
Some like ya'll adjusting something oh
yes they do excavating it right at this

336
00:29:11,70 --> 00:29:18,47
moment. Do you remember then.
Working on the railway the

337
00:29:18,48 --> 00:29:22,95
ski railway do you remember the political
business over the over the siting of the

338
00:29:22,95 --> 00:29:24,15
key railway remember when there was

339
00:29:24,15 --> 00:29:28,61
a battle on over. Yes yes i
remember the result. It was

340
00:29:28,61 --> 00:29:33,57
a prong of fear too but these sketches
that i used to do would try and illustrate

341
00:29:34,33 --> 00:29:35,84
what it would look like if such and such

342
00:29:35,84 --> 00:29:42,08
a stunt and. That's all there was of
the very actually engineering why some

343
00:29:42,08 --> 00:29:46,85
portable location. It wasn't terribly
important who was at it. I don't think it was

344
00:29:46,85 --> 00:29:50,79
changed very much. We were just now
you know with the proposal there was

345
00:29:50,79 --> 00:29:56,51
a number of proposals where the location of
the station was a big battle between mr.

346
00:29:56,51 --> 00:30:01,24
Knock knock. And kirby's who wanted it round
the corner by him and james fraser who

347
00:30:01,24 --> 00:30:05,53
supported him and the rest of the people
who want bradfield who want to do in the

348
00:30:05,53 --> 00:30:12,36
middle. Why can't remember that when
you know i wasn't there i was i wasn't

349
00:30:12,36 --> 00:30:17,48
likely to be mixed up with that sort of
thing. Only i had pretty used to that now.

350
00:30:18,12 --> 00:30:21,93
I mean why not go easily a quite well it's

351
00:30:21,94 --> 00:30:26,23
a less now the workers building. It's still
there is the ironworkers building. Yes

352
00:30:26,23 --> 00:30:33,19
. Not i don't know. But come back
to the bridge. What work did you

353
00:30:33,19 --> 00:30:37,21
actually do. Did you do any actual work
on the harbour bridge itself on the

354
00:30:37,21 --> 00:30:44,20
contract work. No physical work but on
the design where i didn't know any. Good

355
00:30:44,20 --> 00:30:49,37
you see that much of the design was done
with don't want long and god had the job

356
00:30:49,37 --> 00:30:56,22
of doing the departmental checks
on me but no i don't know i

357
00:30:56,22 --> 00:30:58,32
didn't do very much. I used to do

358
00:30:58,32 --> 00:31:03,24
a lot of running about for one reason
or i wasn't an associate of the actual

359
00:31:03,24 --> 00:31:06,43
construction. Can you rember what
running around you did for dr.

360
00:31:06,43 --> 00:31:13,24
Redfield. But i can't.

361
00:31:14,73 --> 00:31:20,61
I. Not really know my for except i
used to do it a survey work with

362
00:31:20,61 --> 00:31:26,86
a bloke called roger butler. Yes he just
died last year of the year before i hand

363
00:31:26,86 --> 00:31:32,70
his his just this spotlight was
talked about security for years.

364
00:31:34,13 --> 00:31:37,67
But what do you do we do
with the right about them.

365
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:45,31
Right. You had to do survey work and
the call. I mean to go help me with

366
00:31:45,31 --> 00:31:46,63
a chain do

367
00:31:46,64 --> 00:31:53,58
a survey work with him and when you.
So watch survey was he doing. He was

368
00:31:53,58 --> 00:31:57,45
he was doing the survey work for the for
the bridge itself checking with auburn

369
00:31:57,45 --> 00:32:00,41
lungs. Well yes it was the
initial investigations i.
