1
00:00:09,5 --> 00:00:25,38
Station five with faith and. Side B. and The tape will begin in about ten seconds time and of identification.

2
00:00:26,1 --> 00:00:33,92
Do you want to just continue where you left off talking about. Paul and Poppy WILLIAMS Singing lessons of course.

3
00:00:33,99 --> 00:00:50,47
Yes So poor introduced me to shoot it. And he introduced me also to work war and to work peace was all about.

4
00:00:52,39 --> 00:00:55,71
And in that tiny flat there.

5
00:00:58,53 --> 00:01:09,08
It was also a center for people who were for peace and at that stage who we were working against the continued.

6
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:19,23
Manufacturing of the atom bomb. Because Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We're still very fresh. You know.

7
00:01:20,2 --> 00:01:29,07
And we had a petition going to have the atom bomb. And there in that time a little you know we would meet.

8
00:01:31,26 --> 00:01:36,45
With and just discuss ideas about peace and about war

9
00:01:36,45 --> 00:01:44,6
and if ever there was one who was an authority to speak on the horrors of four it was poor.

10
00:01:45,75 --> 00:01:50,24
And then I would say Paul was in his mid sixty's or so.

11
00:01:51,12 --> 00:02:01,04
And he'd experienced the first world for he was in Russia just before the recent revolution. In.

12
00:02:01,06 --> 00:02:10,42
And he was able to compare. The situation in what became the Soviet Union. With.

13
00:02:10,44 --> 00:02:14,51
The situation under serfdom and the situation under communism.

14
00:02:14,98 --> 00:02:20,84
And he said whether or not people hated the fact that it became a communist state

15
00:02:21,6 --> 00:02:26,29
and the thing is that he lifted the surface.

16
00:02:27,07 --> 00:02:33,91
And this little flame became more than just a place for me to learn about music.

17
00:02:33,92 --> 00:02:40,32
It became a place for me to understand what politics were about.

18
00:02:41,58 --> 00:02:50,19
We had very beautiful music leading in that little room to raise funds for the New South Wales Peace Committee.

19
00:02:50,61 --> 00:03:00,47
The New South Wales Peace Council I think it was named. And I think that was. Around about forty or so.

20
00:03:00,8 --> 00:03:07,39
Considered this government as a dangerous rigid organization.

21
00:03:07,67 --> 00:03:14,82
That was they had to be virtually wiped out but they had people in it who were made of steel

22
00:03:14,82 --> 00:03:27,67
and we weren't going to be wiped out. People like Bob am poor off. I often felt I was not with any of these two people.

23
00:03:28,57 --> 00:03:41,47
Culturally they were just rich. Materially of course almost poor. And. But we always very special.

24
00:03:41,57 --> 00:03:50,53
But you had just she also had a terrible slave as you see she was still very young so I was about twenty eight twenty

25
00:03:50,54 --> 00:04:01,06
six or something. Terribly young. And there was very little in because not that many people.

26
00:04:01,08 --> 00:04:08,05
From Paul but we had quite a few doing piano. But there wasn't a lot of money to throw or.

27
00:04:09,83 --> 00:04:14,07
And one afternoon when I arrived from Alice and she just came in also.

28
00:04:14,49 --> 00:04:23,58
She had a parcel and what have you got there and she says. But a new dress.

29
00:04:23,6 --> 00:04:35,51
And she had paid seventy twenty seven pounds pounds for dray she'd seen in a window at the cross.

30
00:04:35,53 --> 00:04:47,22
Grain which had re-used patterns of white flour was lovely daisies on it you know.

31
00:04:48,03 --> 00:04:54,16
So she opened it up and just looked at it. Currently seven pounds.

32
00:04:54,24 --> 00:05:00,61
I made your price even pounds those days for interest and think you are doing pretty well. To pay twenty seven pounds.

33
00:05:00,98 --> 00:05:08,26
But when she played the daisies were on the side of the audience.

34
00:05:08,28 --> 00:05:20,37
And she looked heavenly beautiful and she had this beautiful. That she would talk to back in a ponytail.

35
00:05:20,38 --> 00:05:25,58
And she like her friend the musician.

36
00:05:25,6 --> 00:05:38,94
Would usually ruin it all for me because I would find I would be just concentrating on the piano not on my voice.

37
00:05:38,96 --> 00:06:00,61
They certainly were. And then fifty fifty. I actually had to give up. That's true in Downing Street.

38
00:06:02,64 --> 00:06:09,97
And I can't remember why. But I've been looking around for a. Her Place. Really.

39
00:06:11,19 --> 00:06:20,61
And I was at Lilly Williams flat right. Drinking coffee. And talking politics with a few blokes.

40
00:06:20,63 --> 00:06:30,28
And among them was the poet new home. Who was a very senior public servant.

41
00:06:32,46 --> 00:06:37,65
But he was also very quietly working for the New South Wales Pisco school

42
00:06:38,58 --> 00:06:45,12
and Lily was working full time for that council and he was there when I arrived

43
00:06:46,42 --> 00:06:50,72
and they were talking of making plans for what the council should be doing.

44
00:06:52,27 --> 00:06:59,99
And literally just sort of offhandedly said. Well Dowling have you found another place maybe another place to live.

45
00:07:00,01 --> 00:07:13,01
And I said no hasn't really been I'll get mad if I stay in Africa maybe longer. So about two days three days later.

46
00:07:13,03 --> 00:07:22,3
How much hope and powers are the power. I can't remember she sent me a note I think.

47
00:07:24,03 --> 00:07:32,86
And she said We bought a house and perhaps you might like to live in the flat. We've been living in.

48
00:07:33,32 --> 00:07:46,14
Well it happened that they were living. In the flat of. Adamson battlers and Mary Adams.

49
00:07:46,62 --> 00:07:53,67
In McLean Clarence Street in Old Sydney but was a very famous writer

50
00:07:53,67 --> 00:08:00,1
and powered he worked for the Bulletin during the Depression years a very good journalist

51
00:08:01,15 --> 00:08:08,8
and they were going to live for several months in Czechoslovakia or twelve months or something like that with ace.

52
00:08:08,91 --> 00:08:11,71
Who was involved in making films. Rod.

53
00:08:13,12 --> 00:08:18,64
And he said look you can go into the flight because we're going into our house would cure a belief.

54
00:08:19,77 --> 00:08:27,42
And so I went and lived in a flat in Sydney it was the Adamson's flat.

55
00:08:27,43 --> 00:08:42,37
I started this friendship with that was in fifty. And I had lunch with her yesterday.

56
00:08:43,46 --> 00:08:45,76
And it's coming a fifty years since I've known her.

57
00:08:47,95 --> 00:08:54,98
But that kind of took me out of you know why it took me out of that beautiful atmosphere at Kings Cross.

58
00:08:56,12 --> 00:09:04,23
I was I didn't go back. Of course because I went out of Paul but I continued my music lessons with Paul.

59
00:09:05,16 --> 00:09:15,67
Now it was suggested to me to cultural festival in Berlin. And that was suggested to me early one nine hundred fifty.

60
00:09:16,37 --> 00:09:21,52
I was a bit history to pass that they were awful lot of communist involved in the organization.

61
00:09:21,54 --> 00:09:24,72
And I didn't want to be pushed around. No believe me you know.

62
00:09:26,35 --> 00:09:33,13
But I just then I met Margaret for the dancing teacher and she said well I've created this dance.

63
00:09:33,35 --> 00:09:40,58
It has to do with racial discrimination and perhaps you take the part of the ever shorter.

64
00:09:40,59 --> 00:09:49,4
But you have to come to Berlin with us. And she said Oh well you've got to go out to look around to it and.

65
00:09:49,68 --> 00:10:03,58
It will cost four hundred pounds out of money and. Yes on the boat. So I said Oh well I'll give it some thought and.

66
00:10:03,59 --> 00:10:09,95
Then people began to say to me you've got to fight. You've got to. You have been a wonderful experience.

67
00:10:12,38 --> 00:10:25,34
And I began to see myself gathering not a crack I did not mention.

68
00:10:27,17 --> 00:10:31,59
I have to keep the straight because there are also lots of things popping into Vanguard at the moment.

69
00:10:31,91 --> 00:10:47,66
Terrific things happening by then I had a. I was in almost a permanent relationship name of. Poet.

70
00:10:50,12 --> 00:10:59,6
He was a boilermaker. And I want to talk about. I think you should talk about him because he changed my life.

71
00:11:01,38 --> 00:11:11,54
I cannot talk about him. There was a woman born of African father.

72
00:11:13,56 --> 00:11:18,21
I'm not sure but maybe an Aboriginal mother but I'm not sure about that.

73
00:11:20,05 --> 00:11:30,86
And when her mother two sisters when her mother died. The father took them to St Joseph's home. For all of that out.

74
00:11:33,85 --> 00:11:44,44
And she was brought up to a bad man. And then played.

75
00:11:44,46 --> 00:11:50,7
House sight reading was perfect just perfect that it was a very sad

76
00:11:50,7 --> 00:11:53,43
and terrible time in many ways that was the time

77
00:11:53,43 --> 00:12:01,37
when children were beaten with the handle of the dust feather duster if they didn't play the right notes.

78
00:12:02,64 --> 00:12:08,04
And that's what she went through they are.

79
00:12:09,75 --> 00:12:18,09
Finally when she was about sixteen or so and could play complement brilliantly. The father wouldn't got her.

80
00:12:18,11 --> 00:12:30,58
And got her a job at the tearfully theatre. He was in theatre great actor. Told me. And.

81
00:12:31,44 --> 00:12:39,47
She married a man who bought a house in Raleigh street behind the wood Women's Hospital.

82
00:12:39,49 --> 00:12:48,85
And she kept that house beautifully. Anyhow she threw him out after a bit. They were divorced and she had one daughter.

83
00:12:51,26 --> 00:13:04,4
But she and her living by playing the piano. She still alive. She related to call now. She wasn't related. But.

84
00:13:05,33 --> 00:13:19,92
Sunday night at her house was a great gathering place and some of her. I went to regulate. With music this.

85
00:13:19,94 --> 00:13:22,5
And she play for me.

86
00:13:23,67 --> 00:13:27,4
And all the great neighbors would all come and stand in the street

87
00:13:28,51 --> 00:13:39,6
and she'd leave the front door open so they could hear it was a like a concert. When I was. It's Matel go.

88
00:13:39,62 --> 00:13:48,73
And it was a typical terrace house you know nobody waved unless they took a contribution to supper not that you

89
00:13:48,73 --> 00:14:00,4
expected it. But I want to get togethers and so my sister Renie a very beautiful voice would get around the piano.

90
00:14:02,46 --> 00:14:11,02
And one evening we were there and there was this man. And the next Sunday.

91
00:14:11,2 --> 00:14:16,96
There was this man and I I noticed that he knew very well and she knew.

92
00:14:18,19 --> 00:14:29,69
And so he said to me would you like to see film. And I said yes and. So he took me to see a film called.

93
00:14:29,71 --> 00:14:40,23
I think it was on the life of show page. I forgot my Pipelet doesn't matter. I thought it was just it just lovely.

94
00:14:40,35 --> 00:14:47,1
Well I can say that was the beginning of a seven year very close relationship.

95
00:14:47,96 --> 00:14:57,83
So when I was about to talk about going to believe me I was away for eleven months

96
00:14:57,83 --> 00:15:04,78
and for eleven months every fortnight while in London I picked up a money order from him

97
00:15:06,43 --> 00:15:07,82
and he said you've got to see Europe.

98
00:15:08,51 --> 00:15:15,21
And you can go to concerts and you enjoy yourself and it was marvelous just wonderful.

99
00:15:15,35 --> 00:15:21,94
I'm not going to talk any moment this morning that it can I leave that now. Because things are getting a bit confused.
