1
00:00:04,84 --> 00:00:11,20
You only on the executive of the of
the unit or you. I attended when the

2
00:00:11,92 --> 00:00:15,08
rep was away on holidays i
attended in his place but i wasn't

3
00:00:15,08 --> 00:00:20,57
a full executive member. I
was now quietly bassett

4
00:00:21,97 --> 00:00:28,56
filename russell from randwick and.
Kind of moment other names but.

5
00:00:29,10 --> 00:00:35,12
And pat ryan i think was on
the go. Richard richards was

6
00:00:36,42 --> 00:00:43,24
the organiser bagged on the
secretary pretty good talking

7
00:00:43,24 --> 00:00:46,93
fella can't think of his name
he was the president for quite

8
00:00:46,93 --> 00:00:52,59
a few years prior to now quietly
all. Well before now and

9
00:00:54,13 --> 00:00:56,58
i went over there you
know on a break. Many

10
00:00:56,58 --> 00:01:02,15
a time to attend the meetings. Did you
have to also to you were you ever at the

11
00:01:02,15 --> 00:01:08,68
labour council. Attended one conference
and conference but not to belabor council

12
00:01:08,68 --> 00:01:13,56
like it was and i'll peek conference in
the town hall and only attended that once

13
00:01:13,56 --> 00:01:13,76
it's

14
00:01:13,76 --> 00:01:18,73
a boring damn thing to go to unless you're
actively interested since once upon

15
00:01:18,73 --> 00:01:24,02
a time i would no more think of getting
up and speaking publicly but depo started

16
00:01:24,02 --> 00:01:29,31
me off on that you know.
Some people might have

17
00:01:29,31 --> 00:01:32,64
a good brain to think with and everything
else like that but they are not

18
00:01:32,64 --> 00:01:38,81
particularly not not verbally articulate
and they can't put their words in

19
00:01:38,81 --> 00:01:41,98
a meeting and i found myself there

20
00:01:41,98 --> 00:01:48,69
a couple of times being asked. You know. I
know me you can get away with their well

21
00:01:48,69 --> 00:01:49,73
i was anti-family

22
00:01:49,73 --> 00:01:56,60
a union. This is before the
unions merged and. So much so

23
00:01:56,60 --> 00:02:03,49
that when we got deduction of
wages by the. Me department of

24
00:02:03,49 --> 00:02:07,05
you know a union dues to me that was

25
00:02:07,05 --> 00:02:11,47
a step in the right direction when they
made him out of the tramway union they were

26
00:02:11,47 --> 00:02:16,50
always building posed they came out. Try
to come out and i was going to take them

27
00:02:16,50 --> 00:02:23,46
to court but i weakened i could i was i
was really cracking down on the fact

28
00:02:23,46 --> 00:02:29,67
that they discovered this band. You know
so that was one thing so i got up and i

29
00:02:29,67 --> 00:02:30,46
address

30
00:02:30,46 --> 00:02:37,09
a meeting of foiled down could believe it.
I take my belief and then i got up and i

31
00:02:37,09 --> 00:02:44,01
made sense and the most and that i support
it was kelly and that was one thing

32
00:02:44,01 --> 00:02:45,42
but as far as i did

33
00:02:45,42 --> 00:02:50,77
a lot of the back of that truck in man i
mean you know the time things like that we

34
00:02:50,78 --> 00:02:56,95
had to get any war down there. John
armstrong said john armstrong and

35
00:02:58,42 --> 00:03:05,02
senator carl bowers used to come down
support to elections. I worked very hard. I

36
00:03:05,02 --> 00:03:10,79
wasn't the right. But i did work very hard.
I mean you know i would say that i was

37
00:03:10,79 --> 00:03:15,63
one of those people that keep the
banters going just by effort and

38
00:03:18,99 --> 00:03:25,56
goes again applications of the world you
know if you keep out something. And

39
00:03:25,93 --> 00:03:31,45
that's what i did i was working when not
now to brent meaning a day. Why i have

40
00:03:31,45 --> 00:03:38,04
a house shop and there's this.
This matter of contention

41
00:03:38,80 --> 00:03:44,25
came up. And i was working from
male to d y and the terminus

42
00:03:44,25 --> 00:03:49,75
a day. Y was right outside we went up the
stairs so the meeting bagnall was in the

43
00:03:49,75 --> 00:03:56,60
in the you know i'll pay to do
what you do want. So i went about

44
00:03:56,60 --> 00:04:02,36
ten minutes early coming out from any i
mean like hell there parked about where

45
00:04:02,36 --> 00:04:08,14
upstairs move this motion
and seen an architect with

46
00:04:08,14 --> 00:04:12,19
a housing commission and he was another
one that is damaged say. And they were

47
00:04:12,19 --> 00:04:16,44
still going. Half an hour after i do it
and god i never ever thought there was

48
00:04:16,44 --> 00:04:21,60
traditions to. Do i get some
over there. You know so i think

49
00:04:21,60 --> 00:04:28,48
a bomb and fight and then running away but
i had the best community. So you tell me

50
00:04:28,48 --> 00:04:33,32
if you started to tell me if you passed
stories you know driving buses stories

51
00:04:33,32 --> 00:04:36,52
about about buses before when we
were just changing the type of

52
00:04:36,52 --> 00:04:43,49
a well. I can't remember them or you know

53
00:04:44,45 --> 00:04:48,12
store them either. So i don't know what
to say when you were but you were telling

54
00:04:48,12 --> 00:04:53,70
one about speeding krista oh yes
yes. Well. You know driving

55
00:04:53,70 --> 00:04:57,99
a bus number sixteen eleven and will now
be in one of the light of framed our means

56
00:04:57,99 --> 00:05:04,60
not likely allow him is slow change jobs
and i was coming back to denver. Light to

57
00:05:04,60 --> 00:05:11,49
sign off and as i drove over. While
being chill as fast as she got my

58
00:05:11,49 --> 00:05:17,45
foot was right on the accelerator down
the floor and i threw it in neutral. And

59
00:05:17,45 --> 00:05:17,92
remind me

60
00:05:17,92 --> 00:05:23,24
a city where and i was going so fast my
the time i got towards the bottom of the

61
00:05:23,24 --> 00:05:27,44
hill that i got scared and the vibration
was such that i was doing this i was

62
00:05:27,44 --> 00:05:33,43
really being thrown away and. So i applied
the brakes gradually and pulled up.

63
00:05:34,35 --> 00:05:40,25
No passengers in at the time i don't know
where running back special. And but city

64
00:05:40,25 --> 00:05:42,63
where i made a similar
experience a mile but it was

65
00:05:42,63 --> 00:05:48,22
a good place to pick up some speed. He went
down there cowered about over the hill

66
00:05:49,07 --> 00:05:53,86
and he's you know there were two that said
i still don't know how i got through it

67
00:05:53,86 --> 00:05:59,86
and one task here and the other one has
one day where there is and i never hear

68
00:05:59,86 --> 00:06:06,78
these he say was no fault of mine. He
was going too fast to do anything. I

69
00:06:06,79 --> 00:06:12,01
have got and i think that. We ever did you
ever drive any of the heavy albion's as

70
00:06:12,01 --> 00:06:17,37
well you know the old flow change
once yeah yeah you know up

71
00:06:17,37 --> 00:06:22,43
a hill sydney road about two miles an hour
wait five minutes for them to die and

72
00:06:22,43 --> 00:06:28,09
change on the whims you know. We steer the
clutch break it to clutch hard. Count me

73
00:06:28,09 --> 00:06:33,95
and then i think. Well that's an exaggerated
merch what it was like you know.

74
00:06:35,51 --> 00:06:38,42
Have you ever trip in any of the old buses
that have been got at the museum the

75
00:06:38,42 --> 00:06:44,26
tram is there. I haven't seen them. Well

76
00:06:45,43 --> 00:06:49,33
1937 i started on them so you know
i've been to put our i can hit

77
00:06:49,33 --> 00:06:54,47
a funny one about no i would be with the
power they used to have buses for the low

78
00:06:54,47 --> 00:06:59,32
bridge over there and this
particular one ten ten with

79
00:06:59,32 --> 00:07:04,12
a number of it. I think it
was a piece elector. I had

80
00:07:04,12 --> 00:07:10,13
a call on the side for the conductor to
walk along and people said for best.

81
00:07:12,26 --> 00:07:19,24
So. That the one that had the the
engine up the back or on the side or

82
00:07:19,25 --> 00:07:21,58
i forget the engine now i
think it could have been

83
00:07:21,58 --> 00:07:25,79
a sign when i was very much
down the back i saw them over

84
00:07:25,79 --> 00:07:31,65
a bus is there like that and they had to
the entrance was on the front. Yes the

85
00:07:31,65 --> 00:07:37,52
entrance on 10:10 oh i forgot i really can't
remember the other thing about anyway

86
00:07:37,52 --> 00:07:43,34
. The inspector or crowns as we used to
call them got on this bus and appellant

87
00:07:43,34 --> 00:07:49,12
darcy somebody i can't think
we say no. From both depot. He

88
00:07:50,67 --> 00:07:55,30
was standing on the left so much and i was
up must have been the back side and yes

89
00:07:55,30 --> 00:08:00,54
it was come up right there and then in fact
you get on i take your journal examine

90
00:08:00,54 --> 00:08:05,40
the safe side it then they go through
inspecting tickets. So in the bottom deck

91
00:08:05,40 --> 00:08:10,52
meriwether upstairs and he came down.
He says i'm here for two and collected

92
00:08:10,52 --> 00:08:17,52
prayers. Laughter and i said where
father is up there. I'll be

93
00:08:17,52 --> 00:08:23,45
up there he said in the
boat and yes there is no

94
00:08:24,72 --> 00:08:30,52
come up there so i went upstairs and there
specter pointed out to people in front

95
00:08:30,52 --> 00:08:33,60
of both guys it's done

96
00:08:33,60 --> 00:08:39,99
a bloody because it's as i thought
they were on the buses front. So

97
00:08:40,74 --> 00:08:40,95
there was

98
00:08:40,95 --> 00:08:48,71
a story about it and the same
fellow was quick and will take

99
00:08:49,54 --> 00:08:56,03
it when good running back
special. Over. Near.

100
00:08:59,10 --> 00:09:01,64
Him i meant for a time and

101
00:09:02,35 --> 00:09:07,46
a bit to top that completely off. And he
took it back in the depot and booked it up

102
00:09:07,46 --> 00:09:14,41
top take light. Of the
funniest ones i'm going to let

103
00:09:14,41 --> 00:09:16,36
my hair. There's

104
00:09:16,37 --> 00:09:23,16
a bridge the sewer pipe in then and
there. They regularly used to cut the

105
00:09:23,16 --> 00:09:29,55
tops up with that one just the concrete
is all scarred where there are no quite

106
00:09:29,55 --> 00:09:33,33
easy. Yeah. Yes he had quite
a few funny stories on

107
00:09:33,33 --> 00:09:37,57
a man whom i can't make them all who mind
at the moment. But those who were pretty

108
00:09:37,57 --> 00:09:44,34
white are you. Philip and then that bus
used to say about. I don't know but i

109
00:09:44,34 --> 00:09:49,60
meant ten more than anything else and. And
i don't know if you've ever seen in the

110
00:09:49,60 --> 00:09:54,86
corridor alongside i'm serious. Funnily
enough in england on the southdown buses

111
00:09:54,86 --> 00:09:58,99
the country buses were like that. You know.
And of course that they all came from

112
00:09:58,99 --> 00:10:03,61
england in both ways you know used to be
like they were you know we used to it was

113
00:10:03,61 --> 00:10:07,67
about six or seven miles out of eastbourne
where i lived you know under sort of the

114
00:10:07,67 --> 00:10:11,89
south and buses and maidstone district
buses i know. And they were all like that

115
00:10:11,89 --> 00:10:17,33
they had all. I'm not stairs anyway they
had the corridor along one side. Yes well

116
00:10:18,46 --> 00:10:19,86
i i never thought i'd be

117
00:10:19,86 --> 00:10:26,40
a bus driver who used to cheat you know and
late at night. The driver and in fact.

118
00:10:26,41 --> 00:10:27,61
Been my wife knows

119
00:10:27,61 --> 00:10:34,26
a chap time my mother and all the time
he got out one day i came round the back

120
00:10:35,31 --> 00:10:41,81
and that's another i can't
and i know. He said come on

121
00:10:42,84 --> 00:10:49,80
up you go i said when. Is it you know and
i said i said i'm not me. Come on come

122
00:10:49,80 --> 00:10:55,07
on. Anyway i was keen i wanted to but
i was too scared. I didn't even have

123
00:10:55,07 --> 00:11:00,50
a car and i was like so i got in and he
made me drive all the way out of parliament

124
00:11:00,50 --> 00:11:06,01
. This was why and that was my first and
you know. Well you know. So after that we

125
00:11:06,01 --> 00:11:11,04
used to be mothers go. But you always
have your head through the window in case

126
00:11:11,89 --> 00:11:18,78
that was my first experience at the
other one. What he was driving for

127
00:11:18,79 --> 00:11:25,43
managed and they were like and this fellow
took two up front always drunk and you

128
00:11:25,43 --> 00:11:32,08
and that you were in the front
seat. So i got some reps on his

129
00:11:32,08 --> 00:11:39,02
hand and he saw it on the winds when.
Bus pulled up like that out you know i

130
00:11:39,02 --> 00:11:40,75
swear up the stairs. You know it's

131
00:11:40,75 --> 00:11:47,01
a man expected to you and he would sit for
twenty. Weston's hours and when i got up

132
00:11:47,01 --> 00:11:52,53
there. Here is standing arm of those
black and black i've got me into weren't

133
00:11:52,53 --> 00:11:56,84
because that what they said he said i didn't
presume about western i didn't you did

134
00:11:56,84 --> 00:12:03,41
not but. I got certainly should tell him
to and it doesn't matter. He was petrified

135
00:12:06,03 --> 00:12:11,59
. You know i want to find out the one that
appeared out the window that he had no

136
00:12:11,59 --> 00:12:18,55
on the floor. I just i and hoped
and going on the phone and

137
00:12:18,55 --> 00:12:23,35
other kinds and how that turned something
to the cullens is to follow us in the car

138
00:12:24,20 --> 00:12:30,87
. The inspectors the kelly said and i'm
doing them one again and you know.

139
00:12:31,80 --> 00:12:37,94
And coming to coco. Everytime i stop
this money in my in my event and build.

140
00:12:39,48 --> 00:12:45,11
So i couldn't stand it any more. I pulled
up jumped out and went back and i think

141
00:12:45,11 --> 00:12:51,59
if you both. While i'm bloody case
there's bad. Forget about i said so on

142
00:12:52,65 --> 00:12:58,60
and the fellow looked up and said is that
we all lost and there were two women in

143
00:12:58,60 --> 00:13:04,74
the back ten they'd lost her way so they
thought the only safe way was to find bus

144
00:13:04,74 --> 00:13:09,91
again back on the main road and i've
used them if i thought of kelly's. And

145
00:13:12,70 --> 00:13:19,47
that's about all i can think of the moment
you know. You were telling me about

146
00:13:19,47 --> 00:13:21,77
about a time you wrote which was

147
00:13:21,77 --> 00:13:27,02
a venture be published. Yes i'm just i
got put off from the bridge. I tried

148
00:13:27,02 --> 00:13:30,76
everything. And not that
i fancied myself as

149
00:13:30,76 --> 00:13:36,63
a writer but i did limit so feel and
tell me on about an old man having an

150
00:13:36,63 --> 00:13:42,67
injection of much monkey glands. And i
thought it was funny. So i put it into

151
00:13:42,67 --> 00:13:47,56
twelve hours and i can't remember the early
ones like episode long but the payment

152
00:13:47,56 --> 00:13:53,37
just fine the way you know. And the last
time hearses ran like this. The nurse came

153
00:13:53,37 --> 00:13:59,60
out and beckoned me and when i maybe
i think by and i i said monkey when

154
00:14:00,35 --> 00:14:06,61
the nurse came out and beckoned me. But
they were she wasn't certain so far she

155
00:14:06,61 --> 00:14:12,82
said. There's only three but they've already
left the curtain. I cried. I laughed

156
00:14:13,54 --> 00:14:20,54
and then i sang if i cried. I
laughed and then i say if grant

157
00:14:21,81 --> 00:14:28,57
you know i cry no laughs.
And very nearly flattened.

158
00:14:29,80 --> 00:14:36,42
If glands came. Well yeah.
If gran's came for me

159
00:14:36,42 --> 00:14:43,29
and tangs just think what might have
happened and that was it. You know i got ten

160
00:14:43,29 --> 00:14:49,43
sellings from beckett's budget.
It was some points. It was

161
00:14:49,43 --> 00:14:55,76
a weekly. How many verses do you get the
intellect. How many want. How many verses

162
00:14:55,76 --> 00:15:01,25
for ten shillings promises that were i
think i said another one. I mean the poem

163
00:15:01,25 --> 00:15:06,08
and they didn't think much of it and i
never got any more. And so i gave away

164
00:15:15,53 --> 00:15:22,48
. Oh i hope black paint. What
would people want back painful in

165
00:15:22,49 --> 00:15:27,96
the depression era in the depression times
that i didn't sell. I went out to try

166
00:15:27,96 --> 00:15:34,83
and sharpen anything lawnmowers scissors
shears never knew how to sharpen it

167
00:15:35,62 --> 00:15:36,21
still didn't get

168
00:15:36,21 --> 00:15:43,43
a job. I made some toys
and i went out and did

169
00:15:43,44 --> 00:15:46,73
some noughts a door with them monkey on

170
00:15:46,73 --> 00:15:53,63
a stick to test it. My wife came out
with me trying to hawk them. First

171
00:15:53,64 --> 00:15:57,40
up i told sticks for she'll use at

172
00:15:58,38 --> 00:16:05,26
a news agency and by and twelve
another shop on the way home and that

173
00:16:05,26 --> 00:16:11,22
was a teen mom to support
them and i made my sing

174
00:16:11,22 --> 00:16:17,91
a hound's soul and them to
my house and sidney and.

175
00:16:19,43 --> 00:16:26,24
I with that matter would matter would
pay i paid it and you know that when i

176
00:16:26,24 --> 00:16:32,48
made no monkeys and sticks. I planed them
went down to movies with them both and

177
00:16:32,48 --> 00:16:39,20
but i never had any till
i told him that. And we

178
00:16:39,90 --> 00:16:45,86
had to go to paramount to look after the
lines. Till while she was in hospital and

179
00:16:45,86 --> 00:16:52,17
that pay their phantom to parramatta i
would say o'clock in the morning at

180
00:16:52,17 --> 00:16:53,01
nine p.m.

181
00:16:53,01 --> 00:16:59,72
For to finish and then we went
out and to try anything i

182
00:16:59,73 --> 00:17:03,59
more than just for at milton point sold

183
00:17:03,60 --> 00:17:08,81
a moment cremorne pent up. My liberty and
you know the day and i'm pretty good but

184
00:17:10,74 --> 00:17:17,57
yeah i'm finished this time. I don't
believe. You were involved in the

185
00:17:18,66 --> 00:17:25,47
in the disputes with the with the government
bus. The government buses re. The

186
00:17:25,47 --> 00:17:30,87
day off council perhaps you could explain
what what what what this don't cancel

187
00:17:30,87 --> 00:17:35,74
business was well the day i cancelled.
You had two days off a week for

188
00:17:35,74 --> 00:17:42,73
a fortnight and mature
to staff various other

189
00:17:42,73 --> 00:17:47,15
things like that which of course sometimes
may have been brought about by being at

190
00:17:47,15 --> 00:17:52,63
us. After days of cancelled were necessary
they had to get people to do the job so

191
00:17:53,78 --> 00:17:59,89
i believed and it was my contention all
true that my days off my property and that

192
00:17:59,89 --> 00:18:04,63
nobody could make me work on them
if i didn't want to and that was

193
00:18:04,63 --> 00:18:08,71
a principle that i adopted and i think i
may have i could have been suspended over

194
00:18:08,71 --> 00:18:15,47
it but i think the ruster clerks and with
me being active in the union. I don't say

195
00:18:15,47 --> 00:18:22,38
they went quietly on me but the situation
then and i swear i had to do one i

196
00:18:22,38 --> 00:18:28,04
was never compelled to do so i got away
with it. So when the much one mouse

197
00:18:29,23 --> 00:18:30,52
came in i was

198
00:18:30,52 --> 00:18:37,95
a deputy union rep and i had
to why the round with the i do

199
00:18:37,96 --> 00:18:44,57
nothing say nothing observation
from the union's point of view that

200
00:18:44,57 --> 00:18:49,06
the tough guy had that time the strike it
actually happened by that time the first

201
00:18:49,06 --> 00:18:55,28
try cutting debt and that. And that. And
the terms of going back were that there

202
00:18:55,28 --> 00:19:00,78
would be observations of that step as part
of the terms of the settlement that they

203
00:19:00,78 --> 00:19:04,83
go out i would just spend it
several times for points of view.

204
00:19:08,04 --> 00:19:14,75
So we had to go slow and alan horsey
pulled me up and suspended me patterns to

205
00:19:14,75 --> 00:19:20,65
help me amount regulation one to four
people gas and when you have to pass by

206
00:19:21,52 --> 00:19:25,69
drive you up the wall them by the amount
of passengers you know. And where your

207
00:19:25,69 --> 00:19:28,91
test bended that's working
rule working to rule is maybe

208
00:19:28,91 --> 00:19:34,77
a regulation strike they call
now and then i suspend intro

209
00:19:36,33 --> 00:19:41,44
refusing driver batteries squealing backs.
I won that one too. I'm sorry i'm not

210
00:19:41,44 --> 00:19:46,82
back. Exonerated from an ex-con after
pestering the depot master from

211
00:19:46,82 --> 00:19:51,04
a couple of weeks. He said
you're not still on the ice

212
00:19:51,04 --> 00:19:57,11
a turn. I am i said their union and
the partner instructing was such

213
00:19:58,32 --> 00:20:04,57
i said all i needed and that and you
suspended me so i got up and you know. One

214
00:20:04,57 --> 00:20:11,43
meant you had to know that one man
operation in place. And climb government

215
00:20:12,63 --> 00:20:19,38
. One of the first men and rhyme
one mounts down the bookie. He

216
00:20:19,38 --> 00:20:20,03
put in

217
00:20:20,03 --> 00:20:25,83
a nutshell he said instead of striking
over the instant action in one man but as

218
00:20:27,10 --> 00:20:31,84
they turned me fighting to conditions but
when they drive them because they're

219
00:20:31,84 --> 00:20:38,77
going to drive them for two and it was
when i go off and wondered why they didn't

220
00:20:38,77 --> 00:20:43,89
attack that the other way. You know because.
As far as i could see i mean the you

221
00:20:43,89 --> 00:20:47,06
know one man buses have been operation
in various parts of the world. I mean

222
00:20:47,06 --> 00:20:50,65
including the states there but the you
weren't responsible for handling tickets

223
00:20:50,65 --> 00:20:56,99
when you when you were one man but as i
bowl as far as we were concerned. That was

224
00:20:56,99 --> 00:21:01,28
one of the bugbears you know having to be
responsible for the money pull tickets

225
00:21:01,28 --> 00:21:04,08
and everything else like that
but they didn't give the thing

226
00:21:04,08 --> 00:21:08,32
a chance to develop you know you've got
you've got people and landing points

227
00:21:09,01 --> 00:21:09,90
selling the tickets it's

228
00:21:09,90 --> 00:21:15,20
a cop for the driver these days. Providing
and i used to like driving myself i

229
00:21:15,21 --> 00:21:20,44
still like like conducting and i
was a good conductor and i believe

230
00:21:20,44 --> 00:21:24,94
a pretty fair and i mean i don't
i don't remember an accident

231
00:21:27,66 --> 00:21:28,17
that involved

232
00:21:28,17 --> 00:21:35,33
a place. I did push and ask and
seven say that gates once. He

233
00:21:35,33 --> 00:21:42,32
napped i stopped short of the toll going
to town and. It's black and that's us

234
00:21:42,32 --> 00:21:48,92
and sammy mustn't come across like that
and stop there. So i might i just i

235
00:21:48,92 --> 00:21:53,91
move forward slowly macaws and i'm pretty
you know and i know i'm here this way and

236
00:21:53,92 --> 00:21:56,94
when you've got to help more i look
through the fence down here is

237
00:21:56,94 --> 00:22:03,65
a car. I pushed him about six feet. No
damage really because he was up against it.

238
00:22:03,72 --> 00:22:09,08
I spent time in the back. And i tell him
i think look i can't see him from up

239
00:22:09,08 --> 00:22:15,79
a visibility into that i would need
it to either. Go higher but main

240
00:22:15,79 --> 00:22:20,81
problem. Everything will have
to be got over that one for

241
00:22:20,81 --> 00:22:25,10
a while and track where you were driving
buses and there were trams still on the

242
00:22:25,10 --> 00:22:31,47
road if you ever have a sort of you
know you know a long moon boat. We had

243
00:22:31,47 --> 00:22:37,50
a man that might be queen the oils and
that might between the footboard move that

244
00:22:37,50 --> 00:22:43,21
pamphlet i'm saying look i mean shoulder
and dive straight in the tram mcgrattan

245
00:22:44,92 --> 00:22:51,32
mother crowns. Hit me on them of the oil
spill everything else like that in milk

246
00:22:51,32 --> 00:22:54,77
like that there was no nobody like him
and i think he thought that they were

247
00:22:54,77 --> 00:23:01,60
talking probably tie him. Now
the trimmings. Too and they

248
00:23:01,60 --> 00:23:07,16
could pick up quick and passes these
anti-newt now they were known to them

249
00:23:08,82 --> 00:23:14,05
so used to what you see in the top when
you know and that's when we change down

250
00:23:14,05 --> 00:23:18,38
a third time when you know them but they
don't know what is and make so we stopped

251
00:23:19,25 --> 00:23:23,29
once we stopped and that's when the next
time someone that is going all the time

252
00:23:24,06 --> 00:23:29,05
but we always reckon that the only things
came out here that we never you know you

253
00:23:29,05 --> 00:23:35,29
know i was lucky. I drive between
women part mine for many years.

254
00:23:37,86 --> 00:23:42,47
One night i'm coming out from in it and
it pouring down. You can't see the curb.

255
00:23:43,39 --> 00:23:49,55
You can like this where you capitalize
on my ear and i'm way. All my to

256
00:23:51,57 --> 00:23:57,90
look in the back of the bus and then some
of sleep something paper some ten tattoo

257
00:23:57,90 --> 00:24:01,03
anyway. Not if you're
in a world that's not

258
00:24:01,03 --> 00:24:07,11
a gamey confidence. You know i never been
one of the me confident parents. But i

259
00:24:07,11 --> 00:24:13,52
think my team. I was waiting and they
were all happy. You know you were here of

260
00:24:14,24 --> 00:24:20,62
the verses the trip. The trams
trying to ram buses. No one by

261
00:24:20,62 --> 00:24:26,60
deliberately put out the man in one
fight me to make it i didn't have it my

262
00:24:27,87 --> 00:24:33,79
. I abused him in so many times and words
that i called him. But now he's panicked

263
00:24:34,85 --> 00:24:40,86
and. He want to come back and fight me but
he went over the bus and i want you know

264
00:24:40,86 --> 00:24:43,76
they were back and coming forward
on the masses but that was

265
00:24:43,76 --> 00:24:46,87
a mighty between them build it as

266
00:24:46,87 --> 00:24:52,75
a next time and all hell
find that welfare. And

267
00:24:54,34 --> 00:25:00,24
. Tech welfare wanted all night
drama and he and his gun the mills

268
00:25:01,80 --> 00:25:05,87
going to mills work and when the muskegon
saw that coming. They used that when the

269
00:25:05,87 --> 00:25:11,72
call and sweetbreads budget went hand up
on this but print me that time and i think

270
00:25:12,71 --> 00:25:19,24
alec entirely math and i called him. Of
course norms. When we used the stuff from

271
00:25:19,24 --> 00:25:25,22
cal mossman to take up our work mainly
before mookie of before men and

272
00:25:26,66 --> 00:25:32,08
they went down. The spread. And they leave
all the way around. I get the spirit and

273
00:25:32,08 --> 00:25:38,32
then they want to give away their money
but up both sides of print. Bobbsey. Now

274
00:25:38,32 --> 00:25:45,20
impressed that you could believe
it could i went up my first day

275
00:25:45,20 --> 00:25:48,64
on the way my first shift and driver. Had

276
00:25:48,64 --> 00:25:54,47
a big driver buying ten lines
and i got headlights from

277
00:25:54,47 --> 00:25:59,46
a crowd coming and i must i mean the women
and i hit it together and the bus went

278
00:25:59,46 --> 00:26:06,41
like that whom went home and gone
down again. And got off from

279
00:26:06,41 --> 00:26:13,39
people men down from upstairs
and conductors and. People from

280
00:26:13,39 --> 00:26:18,52
a nothing but that fight me and all my
department i had been i hadn't found and

281
00:26:18,52 --> 00:26:25,46
then i went. I was in the swim bike
and i am. After my you can get used

282
00:26:25,46 --> 00:26:31,98
to not letting him right. Why it's
when it's wet and you get the no light

283
00:26:31,98 --> 00:26:38,89
that what the problem was or anywhere
animosity between the bus drivers and and

284
00:26:38,89 --> 00:26:44,95
taxi drivers. So now particularly i
particularly wish to get on pretty well with

285
00:26:44,95 --> 00:26:47,61
them and the place we play
sport against a place like

286
00:26:47,61 --> 00:26:50,03
a matters and football matter. Seems like

287
00:26:50,03 --> 00:26:57,01
a no no no no. And i said you know.

288
00:26:57,02 --> 00:27:00,23
Can you think of any other story you can
think of any other stories about there's

289
00:27:00,23 --> 00:27:01,90
no i won't have

290
00:27:01,90 --> 00:27:07,66
a bit of fun here i'm going back to the
devil and we're just keeping on time. This

291
00:27:07,66 --> 00:27:10,76
girl. I don't know what i'm
going on anyway. She pulled

292
00:27:10,76 --> 00:27:13,13
a make up get out and she tried to do

293
00:27:13,13 --> 00:27:19,19
a lips and i think on the what's the
name of the government further along in

294
00:27:19,20 --> 00:27:25,17
writing. She didn't know what was
going on. So i do it again and after

295
00:27:25,17 --> 00:27:31,61
a while she looked up to my door. She
woke up. It's going on and glared at me

296
00:27:32,36 --> 00:27:38,34
and tell me all to see me
there where that. It was fun.

297
00:27:40,28 --> 00:27:46,18
I really enjoyed my bass when did you come
across any of them in the union case is

298
00:27:46,18 --> 00:27:49,80
about fellas. They were girlfriends
of or their running mate with

299
00:27:49,80 --> 00:27:53,94
a better idea and that was
quite prevalent quite

300
00:27:54,78 --> 00:28:01,59
a lot of them going on. Fairly mate. So
we're supposed to pay and that means.

301
00:28:01,89 --> 00:28:07,76
We didn't have passed. We're all going into
an institute concert and there's about

302
00:28:07,76 --> 00:28:14,29
thirty of us. So what fred did he
reach thirty tickets up you know

303
00:28:14,29 --> 00:28:19,11
content and i think it takes to go through
that you've got a star in tickets up

304
00:28:19,96 --> 00:28:25,46
a game to somebody if your crowd
gets on punch. So you've got

305
00:28:25,46 --> 00:28:29,61
a lot of credit and i don't know we didn't
have to show that was one of the ways

306
00:28:29,61 --> 00:28:35,73
sheet. Oh and. Collins. I
don't know call now and

307
00:28:36,57 --> 00:28:41,04
mainly used to live in golf quite it was
our speed booking but he had survived

308
00:28:41,04 --> 00:28:46,25
a sad sight of his body so he had to get
in and they can't stand under the stairs.

309
00:28:47,66 --> 00:28:53,38
How do you about four stops
then. So they ought to try and

310
00:28:54,93 --> 00:29:01,16
that was. How will and they fire team
crowns got him once for unpaid face

311
00:29:01,16 --> 00:29:07,47
a. But the only time he has to stand
on the stairs and i used to tell him.

312
00:29:07,92 --> 00:29:08,69
