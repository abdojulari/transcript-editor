1
00:00:07,14 --> 00:00:09,38
I'm talking to mr. Clifton
eng who worked as

2
00:00:09,38 --> 00:00:13,68
a holder up on the arch of the sydney
harbour bridge on the north side. Do you

3
00:00:13,68 --> 00:00:18,91
remember when you first got the job there.
Do you mr. Yes i remember. I work with

4
00:00:18,91 --> 00:00:22,79
a fellow named mick higgins he came up to
the hawkesbury river bridge where i was

5
00:00:22,79 --> 00:00:29,61
working and asked me would i come down
and hold up for him i said yes. Make

6
00:00:29,62 --> 00:00:35,24
higgins was it worked with you before. How
do you only around the docks in casual

7
00:00:35,24 --> 00:00:39,70
work and how did you get taken on
by when you got down to the bridge

8
00:00:43,49 --> 00:00:48,08
so long ago i can't remember can't
remember names that but i think it was

9
00:00:48,90 --> 00:00:55,45
a fellow named sam harris who was
foreman on my side. How many

10
00:00:55,45 --> 00:01:02,43
boilermakers and were there on your side.
Remember but i'd only have to have

11
00:01:02,44 --> 00:01:07,34
a guess. When i first started on it.
I think there was only about half

12
00:01:07,35 --> 00:01:13,29
a dozen. And i think. Then again i'm now
a large i don't think there was between

13
00:01:13,29 --> 00:01:15,42
a hundred and undried fifty
i wouldn't say that's

14
00:01:15,42 --> 00:01:22,35
a rough guess what are you to do you start
the in december nineteen twenty seven.

15
00:01:23,47 --> 00:01:27,36
You're right in from the start then did you
go on the approaches before you got on

16
00:01:27,36 --> 00:01:28,31
the arch i we're doing

17
00:01:28,31 --> 00:01:33,40
a little bit of work on their approach
as yes that's the approach spans and

18
00:01:33,40 --> 00:01:40,01
approach bands. Was that easy work or
well it was no there's nothing easy about

19
00:01:40,01 --> 00:01:45,00
the job you know and you're up in the air
and got to keep your wits about you. So

20
00:01:45,00 --> 00:01:49,55
you wouldn't for but there's nothing
easy about the harbour bridge. Working

21
00:01:49,55 --> 00:01:54,74
contract. And. The contractors
were always hard with

22
00:01:54,74 --> 00:01:59,88
a hard but fair they never embarrassed
it's you know but as long as you got to be

23
00:01:59,88 --> 00:02:04,25
capable and do your work and i never worried
you know how did you get up there in

24
00:02:04,25 --> 00:02:11,10
the morning. We we climbed
up. By ladder which is

25
00:02:11,10 --> 00:02:17,87
which was attached to the first columns and
and did it never went up in the cradle

26
00:02:17,87 --> 00:02:22,76
. Oh later on this. You've got over the
water we did go up in the crater yes you

27
00:02:22,77 --> 00:02:28,80
are going up in the cradle. Yes. Yes you
the better the first time which is the

28
00:02:28,80 --> 00:02:29,08
swing

29
00:02:29,08 --> 00:02:34,18
a bit you know we are around on the ball
of the hook but because he get used to it

30
00:02:34,18 --> 00:02:40,84
. Can you tell me about the job of
holding up exactly what it what it

31
00:02:40,84 --> 00:02:47,29
entails. Yes well you get that the
river. They get the river from

32
00:02:48,95 --> 00:02:51,54
the corker. And you get

33
00:02:51,54 --> 00:02:57,23
a you get you get the rev it has get it as
hot as you can and you've got to be very

34
00:02:57,23 --> 00:03:03,75
quick get into the house get your machine
which air driven and push it and get your

35
00:03:03,75 --> 00:03:07,03
machine onto it and. And and then you have

36
00:03:07,03 --> 00:03:12,27
a little lever that gives the rattler
to it and then the boilermaker gets an

37
00:03:12,27 --> 00:03:16,56
e i were both rattling and then he knocks
it down and finishes that off on the

38
00:03:16,56 --> 00:03:21,24
other side and the boilermaker normally
gets you on the inside. If you can and as

39
00:03:21,24 --> 00:03:26,25
me i will. In most cases you have got to
be in the inside but there is times when

40
00:03:26,25 --> 00:03:30,99
they're doing the batch of rivets there's
two parts at two chords together and

41
00:03:30,99 --> 00:03:35,14
they've got to be riveted inside and these
inside with me but most times these

42
00:03:35,14 --> 00:03:41,23
outside and i'm always inside.

43
00:03:42,32 --> 00:03:48,44
In dull days you didn't have much light in
there and you were working on the grade

44
00:03:48,44 --> 00:03:54,87
as. As it was going up very hard
on your legs. And yet to watch the

45
00:03:54,87 --> 00:03:57,12
sparks and the metal
from the river. There's

46
00:03:57,12 --> 00:04:04,08
a come down and from then on you'd
work that way. Was it. Cold

47
00:04:04,08 --> 00:04:09,67
in the winter in the very cold very
cold indeed and hot in the summer.

48
00:04:10,82 --> 00:04:15,88
Especially in the afternoons i suppose. Yes
yes. Do you remember the smell of paint

49
00:04:15,88 --> 00:04:21,41
in there. Oh yeah. So you've always always
had that because they always had fellow

50
00:04:21,41 --> 00:04:25,56
come and painting the edge of the river.
Since you know as you finished it. You

51
00:04:25,56 --> 00:04:26,83
know there's always

52
00:04:26,83 --> 00:04:31,30
a smell of that around inside
that was led paint when it wasn't

53
00:04:31,30 --> 00:04:37,48
a pleasant smell but coarse sort of get
used to everything. Some of the fellows

54
00:04:37,48 --> 00:04:41,63
talked about the shop drillings which used
to get stuck in the paint as well. You

55
00:04:41,63 --> 00:04:47,48
were run across that you would. Now and
again you know but you overcome it.

56
00:04:49,14 --> 00:04:55,81
Do these issues gloves in those
days now gloves. You had your own.

57
00:04:55,83 --> 00:04:58,79
I have to think. Now they may
have had. I'm not too sure

58
00:04:59,94 --> 00:05:06,06
a long while ago. But i would say most times
we never had gloves because it was too

59
00:05:06,06 --> 00:05:09,83
awkward working with them you know
the boilermakers nearly always had

60
00:05:09,83 --> 00:05:14,00
a riveters normally i was hoped loves their
ad that gun in their hand all the time

61
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:18,54
you know they'd have to have their left
hand. Anyway. But you got the gun in your

62
00:05:18,54 --> 00:05:25,52
hand on the other side do. Yes i did.
Well i may have had one i can't remember.

63
00:05:26,41 --> 00:05:29,66
Then i think else you remember about being
inside the courts you remember thinking

64
00:05:29,66 --> 00:05:35,07
about when the plaything used
to shake sometimes. Oh yes.

65
00:05:36,27 --> 00:05:42,87
Sometimes. And when she got right out in
the in in the hard ruins that were blowing

66
00:05:42,87 --> 00:05:43,98
she'd sway

67
00:05:43,98 --> 00:05:49,04
a little but mostly when they were bringing
up. Different parts of the bridge to be

68
00:05:49,04 --> 00:05:55,13
riveted. And they were getting them into
place they'd knock against each and she

69
00:05:55,13 --> 00:05:55,51
would shake

70
00:05:55,51 --> 00:06:00,81
a bit then it wasn't very pleasant but
it makes you think about the cables

71
00:06:02,80 --> 00:06:07,11
. Yes i used to often i had my
mind was on the cables quite

72
00:06:07,11 --> 00:06:13,44
a lot. I used to think with all this weight.
And i hope that's cement held i mean

73
00:06:13,44 --> 00:06:15,78
in the rock you know and i was always

74
00:06:15,78 --> 00:06:20,93
a little bit doubtful whether that how
would you know but i put my. I give the

75
00:06:20,93 --> 00:06:27,32
benefit to the engineers. And several
people have said that they got in their

76
00:06:27,32 --> 00:06:30,80
imagination and they thought when it used
to shake. Do you remember what used what

77
00:06:30,80 --> 00:06:35,96
it used to feel like when they started
moving the creeper crane that really didn't

78
00:06:35,96 --> 00:06:40,78
worry me because the creeper crane was ahead
of us and we were at the back riveting

79
00:06:40,78 --> 00:06:45,83
behind it it didn't shake the arch that
you shake when it moved. No they didn't.

80
00:06:45,85 --> 00:06:47,53
That didn't worry is not

81
00:06:47,53 --> 00:06:53,53
a good. That was ok. Do you did you talk
to any of the engineers about the cables

82
00:06:55,22 --> 00:07:00,70
now. No i don't think i never talk to
any engineers now. Do you member any

83
00:07:00,70 --> 00:07:06,71
accidents while you were working on the
bridge. Oh yes i'm not too sure was out in

84
00:07:06,71 --> 00:07:10,64
the fourth or fifth panel and we were
working in the stitching played underneath

85
00:07:10,64 --> 00:07:17,25
and underneath the cord and they
were working up above screwing

86
00:07:18,03 --> 00:07:21,27
screwing a job up. And all of

87
00:07:21,27 --> 00:07:25,00
a sudden i see something got caught
in the eye and i thought it was

88
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:28,94
a bag of bolts. Going by but then i heard

89
00:07:28,94 --> 00:07:34,28
a commotion and then look and something was
wrong. I thought and i looked over and

90
00:07:34,28 --> 00:07:34,87
i just seen

91
00:07:34,87 --> 00:07:41,76
a fellow just hit the water. And he
disappeared for about one or two minutes

92
00:07:41,76 --> 00:07:47,04
and then floated to the top with his head
and i and stretched looking down into the

93
00:07:47,04 --> 00:07:49,61
water. And i suppose

94
00:07:49,61 --> 00:07:54,56
a minute or two was like that and then he
disappeared. I think they got his body

95
00:07:54,56 --> 00:07:59,85
the next day. Did you know him.
Yes i did know him. Is only

96
00:07:59,85 --> 00:08:06,04
a young fellow about twenty five or so
and an englishman. Do members know. Yes

97
00:08:06,04 --> 00:08:12,30
addison was his name. No
first no. I can't remember.

98
00:08:13,71 --> 00:08:16,53
Then used it was used
to say they called him

99
00:08:16,53 --> 00:08:21,77
a nipper oh yes yes. Yep around us and
years ago i remember it now you've got to

100
00:08:21,77 --> 00:08:28,16
bring them names to me now. So long ago.
Remember stan london dear yes yes i

101
00:08:28,16 --> 00:08:30,70
remember his name he was

102
00:08:30,70 --> 00:08:35,11
a boilermaker he was the addison's paul
america and he's still living in newcastle

103
00:08:35,11 --> 00:08:40,61
now. Yeah still living. How would he
be she said i think he would be eighty

104
00:08:41,96 --> 00:08:48,66
just doesn't look at all these blind
blind luck is i think you had detached

105
00:08:48,66 --> 00:08:53,18
retinas and its eyes is absolutely blind
he would you try to get things fixed up

106
00:08:53,18 --> 00:08:59,23
but no he couldn't ever do anything. It
is burning in cambridge credits to. There

107
00:08:59,24 --> 00:09:02,71
was another fellow working alongside them
where they were screaming and billy beggs

108
00:09:02,71 --> 00:09:09,50
i met him at the turnout
over blues point. Billy

109
00:09:09,50 --> 00:09:09,90
biggs was

110
00:09:09,90 --> 00:09:16,09
a record was me boilermaker and he worked
also on the north side. Yes he was on the

111
00:09:16,09 --> 00:09:22,68
north side right through. He lives at
french's forest. That's right. Who are short

112
00:09:22,68 --> 00:09:24,46
of people on the south side and that's

113
00:09:24,46 --> 00:09:28,96
a fact. Do you remember any of the scene
here is the rigors at all who still

114
00:09:28,96 --> 00:09:34,54
a wreck to the steel. I remember
i don't know their names as

115
00:09:34,54 --> 00:09:39,56
a little french fella. I
think harris was was was

116
00:09:39,56 --> 00:09:42,49
a number one rigger he
was a foreman rigger

117
00:09:42,49 --> 00:09:45,63
a little frenchman very
little fellow he was

118
00:09:45,63 --> 00:09:52,54
a very capable and i just can't run call
their names too long ago and i think you.

119
00:09:53,18 --> 00:09:59,21
Can you do you remember ever remember being
scared. While you working on the bridge

120
00:09:59,21 --> 00:10:04,24
. Well i did have a thrill. If
you caught it scared the bit of

121
00:10:04,24 --> 00:10:10,96
a thrill. I had to go up and we were working
on. Some little job was on the job.

122
00:10:11,05 --> 00:10:15,42
I just can't remember but i know i had to
get right about three quarter way up to

123
00:10:15,42 --> 00:10:18,09
the top. I think it was to check on

124
00:10:18,09 --> 00:10:23,54
a couple of boats. I can't remember when
i got up there. I just noticed up the

125
00:10:23,54 --> 00:10:29,33
harbor big clouds coming down just like.
And i thought to myself this is going to

126
00:10:29,33 --> 00:10:30,33
be good and all of

127
00:10:30,33 --> 00:10:35,53
a sudden it hit us westerly gale and all i
just sat there were hanging on for about

128
00:10:35,53 --> 00:10:39,93
a quarter of an hour twenty minutes and i
didn't subside much but i worked my way

129
00:10:39,93 --> 00:10:45,64
down. Glad to get down as the photographer
said about that he said the used to

130
00:10:45,64 --> 00:10:47,68
watch the observatory
because they used to drive

131
00:10:47,68 --> 00:10:53,95
a black ball when it's done so that he
was coming. Yes. Do you remember another

132
00:10:53,95 --> 00:11:00,01
time when you were up the top. We used to
see all sorts of things there. I remember

133
00:11:00,01 --> 00:11:00,88
one day and

134
00:11:00,89 --> 00:11:07,25
a beautiful beautiful summer
day and very clear and

135
00:11:08,87 --> 00:11:12,47
you could see under the water quite
quite a lot. All of a sudden we've seen

136
00:11:12,47 --> 00:11:13,07
a big form

137
00:11:13,07 --> 00:11:18,64
a form must have been twenty years
thirty feet long. I'm sure. And it was

138
00:11:18,64 --> 00:11:24,05
a whale and he had barnacles on him miss
we put our couldn't get out of the harbor

139
00:11:24,06 --> 00:11:26,81
i believe and i noticed

140
00:11:26,81 --> 00:11:32,63
a stand. Aj launch which is to take the
boy used to take the workers over to the

141
00:11:32,63 --> 00:11:36,17
ships they were following him around with

142
00:11:36,18 --> 00:11:43,13
a photographer this. Every time he came
up they sort of spurted spurted water

143
00:11:43,13 --> 00:11:46,06
which the whales do.
When they lost him for

144
00:11:46,07 --> 00:11:52,16
a while but we seen him and we seen him
coming up up up and i see it come right

145
00:11:52,16 --> 00:11:58,38
under their launch and nearly tipped it
up. But that was the end of taking the

146
00:11:58,39 --> 00:12:04,21
photos of the whale they went for their
life. Good incident was remember any others

147
00:12:04,21 --> 00:12:11,05
do you. Just think well the
working conditions like on that

148
00:12:11,05 --> 00:12:16,91
job. Well the money wasn't
bad in them days we got £10

149
00:12:16,91 --> 00:12:19,38
a week. I think a well i think

150
00:12:19,38 --> 00:12:26,38
a tradesman on the ground in most most
jobs around sydney were i think it

151
00:12:26,38 --> 00:12:30,60
was about £4 eighteen a week. So
we were getting £10 we got £10

152
00:12:30,60 --> 00:12:35,28
a week for the first seven panels
and the next seven panels we got

153
00:12:35,28 --> 00:12:39,18
a rise of seven shillings £10 seven hour

154
00:12:39,19 --> 00:12:44,35
a minute. These are was. We were never had
any amenities we just hang our close up

155
00:12:46,62 --> 00:12:52,58
. Got into our overalls
up we went no morning tea

156
00:12:53,65 --> 00:12:58,77
where the climb down for dinner
when we come down by by the

157
00:13:00,87 --> 00:13:07,09
by the cage but. Do

158
00:13:08,52 --> 00:13:15,23
you ever adore and long being harder than
any other employer. Well i said no they

159
00:13:15,23 --> 00:13:18,49
weren't hard but you know as long as you're
done your work. They didn't trouble you

160
00:13:18,49 --> 00:13:23,22
but you had to do your work and keep
working. No no don't get in groups and talk

161
00:13:23,22 --> 00:13:26,32
you've just done your work because
they were contracting for

162
00:13:26,32 --> 00:13:31,54
a job. No i can't say they were fair but
you know i had to do your work. I knew

163
00:13:31,54 --> 00:13:36,88
what they were doing that absolutely
they knew what they were doing. Yes. But

164
00:13:38,11 --> 00:13:40,77
getting back to your men at these
assumed you got down oh it was

165
00:13:40,77 --> 00:13:44,76
a one tap there i think and you just washed
your hands. You didn't you went out.

166
00:13:45,03 --> 00:13:48,57
Pretty grubby. But you do up

167
00:13:48,57 --> 00:13:55,48
a top if you want to go the toilet. Well
nature took its course and it was over the

168
00:13:55,48 --> 00:14:00,99
side or the other way. You know you have
to go down but you seem to get used to

169
00:14:02,34 --> 00:14:06,55
didn't happen much i think you've
got used to nature you know.

170
00:14:09,46 --> 00:14:13,97
Well do you remember any union meetings
or industrial action there were

171
00:14:13,97 --> 00:14:19,53
a few meetings but i can't remember. I
never remember any strike so i think there

172
00:14:19,53 --> 00:14:21,40
was something to do with the crane drive

173
00:14:21,40 --> 00:14:25,90
a couple of times but i don't think
were involved in any strikes

174
00:14:25,90 --> 00:14:32,48
a clear of them. I think. Do you remember
the vegetation for the hope money.

175
00:14:33,62 --> 00:14:34,60
Yes there was there was

176
00:14:34,60 --> 00:14:39,07
a some agitation for that for that but
right through. I don't think we had

177
00:14:39,07 --> 00:14:44,94
a lot of trouble. To member the
union meetings here so remember

178
00:14:44,94 --> 00:14:51,86
a couple but still far i can't remember
what went on. You know it was too far too

179
00:14:51,86 --> 00:14:58,77
long ago. Do you remember the closing of
the arch to yes but i was an up there at

180
00:14:58,77 --> 00:15:02,47
the time i think i got my dismissal before

181
00:15:02,48 --> 00:15:06,01
a while while they were working on that
because you couldn't have them all up there

182
00:15:06,01 --> 00:15:12,29
and most of the riveting was
done done to there but i was

183
00:15:12,29 --> 00:15:16,47
a little bit disappointed iceberg because
i was there from the onset of the arch

184
00:15:17,34 --> 00:15:21,85
but somebody had to go. I think and i
was just one of them. Jim we're getting

185
00:15:21,85 --> 00:15:25,10
canberra to bob it is and
they rewarded us with

186
00:15:25,10 --> 00:15:30,65
a can better or two shillings. But i don't
think i had it long because the pressure

187
00:15:30,65 --> 00:15:36,27
is on them and it was very valuable for me
to spend what happened to you then. Did

188
00:15:36,27 --> 00:15:36,49
you get

189
00:15:36,49 --> 00:15:43,69
a job. I worked along the waterfront for the
for about three or four years i suppose

190
00:15:44,40 --> 00:15:46,50
just getting a few weeks
there in a day and

191
00:15:46,50 --> 00:15:52,42
a day there in the trade and
then i've got a job and as

192
00:15:52,42 --> 00:15:58,93
a conductor and driving and driving trams.
So i never went back to the ironworkers

193
00:15:59,97 --> 00:16:06,57
. Were you on the dole ever. Yes i was on
the dole with plenty of others. And very

194
00:16:06,57 --> 00:16:12,42
good very talented men were on the dole
in them days. No work for them. You know

195
00:16:12,42 --> 00:16:17,97
what the dole was when you were on it. Yes
i think we got at first we had so we got

196
00:16:17,97 --> 00:16:21,33
a list of groceries you could
have i think it was the value of

197
00:16:23,63 --> 00:16:25,71
a leavens of eleven shillings

198
00:16:26,42 --> 00:16:31,40
a couple and you had to have what was on
paper but they done away with that and you

199
00:16:31,40 --> 00:16:36,85
could just pick what you wanted after that
jeff remembered getting your you dole in

200
00:16:36,85 --> 00:16:37,13
kind

201
00:16:38,61 --> 00:16:42,53
a bigger one. Do you remember getting it
doll in groceries rather than rather than

202
00:16:42,53 --> 00:16:47,67
coupons even yes i do remember that. Yes.
Where did you go to get it. Well i was

203
00:16:47,67 --> 00:16:54,12
there used to be down it down at the
wharf just near that wasn't far from the

204
00:16:54,12 --> 00:16:57,09
bridge. We went with there
we got some meat and

205
00:16:57,88 --> 00:17:03,97
a few loaves of bread. We ate the walk
down for my card to get it. And then world

206
00:17:03,97 --> 00:17:10,24
work more never the three of us to pay
the fare. And what did you do about the

207
00:17:10,24 --> 00:17:16,82
money for cooking. Well where i was
living with my mother and father in law.

208
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:22,18
Like most people they families were living
together and you just settled on the way

209
00:17:22,18 --> 00:17:26,91
you could you didn't have to worry about
rent therefore now didn't have to worry

210
00:17:26,91 --> 00:17:33,17
about rent. Do you think
else about those times. Yes

211
00:17:34,47 --> 00:17:38,41
. The council used to at
times i used to give you

212
00:17:38,41 --> 00:17:43,99
a fortnight work working and for the
council probably working on the roads or

213
00:17:43,99 --> 00:17:48,36
making gutters and things like that. Get

214
00:17:48,36 --> 00:17:53,08
a fortnight's wages and you put your of
the dole for three weeks. You couldn't

215
00:17:53,08 --> 00:17:56,35
apply for the dole for three
weeks after that but was that

216
00:17:56,35 --> 00:18:03,23
a new law of rates and that helped you to
pay the rates the house did you had to do

217
00:18:03,23 --> 00:18:07,72
that for you and mother didn't lauded you
as i had to do that. So as my mother look

218
00:18:07,72 --> 00:18:13,99
at power rage because her husband wasn't
working ever to member any other things

219
00:18:13,99 --> 00:18:20,81
about those times. In them times
in the depression. Yet he

220
00:18:20,81 --> 00:18:25,72
had go down to go down around the different
places of docs in places and you stand

221
00:18:25,72 --> 00:18:31,37
about four hours. You might just
to get a day's work or half

222
00:18:31,37 --> 00:18:36,50
a day's work you lined up every day there
was nowhere else to go and just with just

223
00:18:36,50 --> 00:18:37,29
the hope that you'd get

224
00:18:37,29 --> 00:18:42,93
a bit of work but that was hard but you
got used to it was that what they call

225
00:18:42,93 --> 00:18:47,11
towing the line that was right that
was towing a line. And how many times

226
00:18:47,11 --> 00:18:52,100
a day to do you turn the line morning
and in a time twice a day twice

227
00:18:53,01 --> 00:18:59,100
a day. To remove the accuracy with which
the work had to be done. Yes i remember

228
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,11
that because where i was putting the where
i had to put the rivets into the house

229
00:19:05,11 --> 00:19:10,56
that the be accurate because they were long
rivets. And very rarely get one out of

230
00:19:10,56 --> 00:19:14,88
position and if there was one out of
position we had to drift it putting

231
00:19:14,89 --> 00:19:18,05
a drift in and knocking it
through with a to seven or

232
00:19:18,05 --> 00:19:24,62
a fourteen pound hammer but i'd say right
through that the work their accuracy

233
00:19:24,62 --> 00:19:27,81
was practically almost a hundred per cent.

234
00:19:28,80 --> 00:19:34,52
. Do you remember by comparison to other
work. It was much better much better in

235
00:19:34,52 --> 00:19:41,39
their work in the in. In the dockyards
and in them places. You know using

236
00:19:41,39 --> 00:19:44,62
drifts quite a lot and they were
reaming house but there wasn't

237
00:19:44,62 --> 00:19:47,56
a ream are on their job.
There wasn't supposed to be

238
00:19:47,56 --> 00:19:50,63
a heavy drift over. Well
you had to help yourself

239
00:19:50,63 --> 00:19:56,91
a little. Do you remember the inspectors
do. Yes they used to come around with

240
00:19:56,92 --> 00:19:58,53
their little hammer after it finished

241
00:19:58,53 --> 00:20:03,92
a cord. And they tap everyone you
know you'd get off a couple get

242
00:20:03,92 --> 00:20:09,93
a few to be cut out and then when they had
to be cut out the boilermaker they have

243
00:20:11,34 --> 00:20:18,01
just. He had a little machine something
like a caulking machine and they put

244
00:20:18,01 --> 00:20:21,75
a diamond shaped tool into that and they
cut right through the head of the rivet.

245
00:20:23,01 --> 00:20:27,95
And then it reverse it and put it on another
snap one half of it off the other half

246
00:20:27,95 --> 00:20:30,51
. We would have to put a point on it at

247
00:20:30,51 --> 00:20:34,43
a point whether with the handle. He
put it on and i'd knock it off with

248
00:20:34,43 --> 00:20:38,94
a hammer and then we'd not but
through and replace it with

249
00:20:38,94 --> 00:20:45,82
a good rivet. Do you have many now
we didn't have many pretty good.

250
00:20:45,90 --> 00:20:49,72
They were screwed up the jobs are screwed
up pretty good. Who was your assembly

251
00:20:49,72 --> 00:20:56,72
going going ahead of you. Oh i can't
remember their names and no chance. I

252
00:20:56,72 --> 00:21:00,81
can't remember names and you know how many
what was there in there and whether in

253
00:21:00,81 --> 00:21:07,70
a riveting three you know the river huda
hole or up in the boilermaker that's on

254
00:21:07,70 --> 00:21:12,81
the arch. Yes. And the shops that were
more. Well i don't know anything about the

255
00:21:12,81 --> 00:21:18,87
shops i never worked in there. And
how many were there in assembly.

256
00:21:23,24 --> 00:21:29,40
You mean riggers and no
there were well i think.

257
00:21:30,34 --> 00:21:37,08
Oh well i think on our job on jobs we
were i think the two or three gangs of

258
00:21:37,08 --> 00:21:43,67
of bowling up gangs of two men with
their be an ironworker and to go

259
00:21:43,67 --> 00:21:44,50
boil and make

260
00:21:44,50 --> 00:21:50,06
a nine worker. And then the painters going
around touching up the rivets were they

261
00:21:50,06 --> 00:21:55,69
part of the gang or were they separate now
they weren't part the gang there were

262
00:21:55,69 --> 00:21:58,32
just separate catching up. I
think it was oh and work was

263
00:21:58,32 --> 00:22:04,01
a touch them up there you know red led and
that sort of stuff but just to preserve

264
00:22:04,01 --> 00:22:09,35
them. You did you didn't have anything to
do with the erection side of things. Did

265
00:22:09,35 --> 00:22:12,71
you now. Now do you member the seal

266
00:22:12,71 --> 00:22:19,25
a writers oh yes they were
pretty fearless fellas. Yes

267
00:22:20,03 --> 00:22:20,32
they were

268
00:22:20,32 --> 00:22:25,95
a select band of their own they were very
very good member of the crane drivers at

269
00:22:25,95 --> 00:22:31,33
all but i much about the cry and i
was only seen a mike there like

270
00:22:31,33 --> 00:22:34,73
a little there little head up above
you know we weren't connected with

271
00:22:34,73 --> 00:22:39,23
a match. You know you don't remember how
many references you had you don't remember

272
00:22:39,23 --> 00:22:46,11
how many of that crane drivers on each
creature crane there were do you. I

273
00:22:46,12 --> 00:22:51,16
think there was only one one driver was i
think there has to be four but anyway.

274
00:22:51,78 --> 00:22:57,13
Well i tell you i don't know i don't know
any about the drivers or not i wouldn't

275
00:22:57,13 --> 00:22:58,52
know. Well i suggest trying to get at

276
00:22:58,52 --> 00:23:04,82
a point just just bear with me because i
had no actual evidence that there were

277
00:23:04,82 --> 00:23:07,96
four people said they were might have been
through the matter before but when you

278
00:23:07,96 --> 00:23:10,29
come to think of it. Now
there's two there's

279
00:23:10,29 --> 00:23:14,19
a main creeper crane driver he was on the
on the creeper crown on the front. We had

280
00:23:14,19 --> 00:23:18,41
two main controls apart from having the
crane around there was one was the. The

281
00:23:18,41 --> 00:23:22,03
main left and the other was what is known
as the jigger hoist and that worked off

282
00:23:22,03 --> 00:23:25,87
together so they could one of the point of
balance and one at the lower end so they

283
00:23:25,87 --> 00:23:27,88
could lift something at an angle. It was

284
00:23:27,88 --> 00:23:30,48
a creeper crane's job and there was another
little cry and you slipped you in the

285
00:23:30,48 --> 00:23:36,88
cradle on the front. Yes i remember the
one that used to pull us up. On the cage

286
00:23:36,88 --> 00:23:43,67
yes i remember that fella. He used to go.
Well our resignedly. He said travis on

287
00:23:44,48 --> 00:23:50,17
attached to the big crane. So that's two
for sure if it's your now on the back now

288
00:23:50,17 --> 00:23:53,23
when you were wanting your tools and bits
and pieces up you there was two more on

289
00:23:53,23 --> 00:23:59,78
the back wasn't jackson that happened
to addison do you remember him

290
00:23:59,79 --> 00:24:02,73
much before that i mean we missed

291
00:24:02,73 --> 00:24:08,85
a week or two before that he slipped this
other time i didn't notice what he did

292
00:24:08,85 --> 00:24:13,97
probably screwing up and he tumbled down
but he didn't go over the court this day.

293
00:24:14,12 --> 00:24:20,02
It fell fell against the post i thought he
was very lucky that day. Whether the man

294
00:24:20,02 --> 00:24:26,86
was careless or didn't keep his mind on
the job. I did well i would like to say.

295
00:24:28,50 --> 00:24:33,77
Do you remember him. Do you no were very
well do you know i know well you're just

296
00:24:33,77 --> 00:24:38,68
working amongst you but i don't think it
was until long and the job when he fell

297
00:24:38,68 --> 00:24:44,57
i'm not too sure but he was an englishman
but i didn't speak to him much just given

298
00:24:44,57 --> 00:24:49,69
the time of the day you know he was just
married was now i believe he was yes

299
00:24:51,51 --> 00:24:57,63
but. During different nationalities of
the people who worked on the bridge.

300
00:24:58,49 --> 00:25:05,00
Well there were englishmen irishmen
scotchman of course australians.

301
00:25:06,25 --> 00:25:12,85
I remember little of rigor frenchmen
and seemed to be the norwegians or

302
00:25:12,85 --> 00:25:17,84
swedes and i think germans as far as
i could make out but there was quite

303
00:25:17,84 --> 00:25:23,94
a mixture. For the united nations with
the rigours where they. Yeah the united

304
00:25:23,94 --> 00:25:28,29
nations of the region were eggers but they
were they were very good very good at

305
00:25:28,29 --> 00:25:35,10
the bay. No wildmen some of them too. I
understand. Yes well on an off night

306
00:25:35,10 --> 00:25:39,00
not on really big because you couldn't
be while you keep your wits about you

307
00:25:42,77 --> 00:25:49,73
. Where were you born cliff. I
was born in balmain the home of

308
00:25:50,44 --> 00:25:57,19
shipbuilding and ship building repairs
you know what lies. I suppose i

309
00:25:57,19 --> 00:26:02,82
fell into what naturally most most people
around there work in the docks and that

310
00:26:02,82 --> 00:26:07,10
type of thing you know i was
apprentices. Early in my life as

311
00:26:07,10 --> 00:26:13,84
a shipwright but the fellow i was working
with went broke and i never followed

312
00:26:13,84 --> 00:26:20,73
that up. I just followed up the docks then
and did casual work. Working with the

313
00:26:20,73 --> 00:26:27,59
monks boilermakers and iron
workers and then on. So i

314
00:26:27,59 --> 00:26:33,44
just battle along. When you leave
school. I left skill and i was fourteen

315
00:26:34,69 --> 00:26:38,50
and he went straight out of the tivoli
apprenticeship right now. I was working on

316
00:26:38,50 --> 00:26:39,81
my first job was working with

317
00:26:39,81 --> 00:26:46,47
a fella making confetti. And then another
place i worked putting threads on

318
00:26:46,47 --> 00:26:53,42
nuts and nuts and bolts and then
i think i went went in as an

319
00:26:53,42 --> 00:27:00,15
apprentice ship right but as i say i never
followed up when the fellow went broke.

320
00:27:00,17 --> 00:27:06,06
Do you remember how do you wind up in the
whole spirit. Oh well i was working for

321
00:27:06,06 --> 00:27:08,78
the railway there as i was only

322
00:27:08,78 --> 00:27:14,08
a junior when i was working at the railway
i was working for the them putting them

323
00:27:14,88 --> 00:27:21,75
. Overhead overhead department
you know electric stations.

324
00:27:21,93 --> 00:27:27,01
I was working on the steel work but there
and when i turned twenty one. They put me

325
00:27:27,01 --> 00:27:29,12
off and i applied for

326
00:27:29,12 --> 00:27:33,10
a job and they were to be river bridge and
i got it i suppose i was up there about

327
00:27:33,10 --> 00:27:39,17
. Nine months of something and then that's
how i got the job on harbour bridge when

328
00:27:39,17 --> 00:27:44,46
micky gyns approach me.
Who was making begins was

329
00:27:44,46 --> 00:27:47,05
a very wild man he was

330
00:27:47,05 --> 00:27:53,64
a boxer in his early days very
wild and dangerous to work with

331
00:27:53,64 --> 00:27:54,23
he had

332
00:27:54,23 --> 00:28:00,92
a very vile temper. I don't know
why i come to get away from him.

333
00:28:01,79 --> 00:28:08,07
I can't remember whether i whether he left
on the bridge. I don't i know he didn't

334
00:28:08,07 --> 00:28:14,01
stay on the bridge. Too long because he'd
i think he'd get into holes where there

335
00:28:14,01 --> 00:28:16,33
with the management he
was a hard man to hold

336
00:28:16,33 --> 00:28:23,22
a job and that's how i come to work
with this scotchman who was his name.

337
00:28:25,18 --> 00:28:30,41
I worked with him for over two years and i
can't remember his name. Do you remember

338
00:28:30,41 --> 00:28:36,66
any other boilermakers that are well known
around the place who you work with. Well

339
00:28:36,67 --> 00:28:38,95
i was billy beg's there and there was

340
00:28:39,67 --> 00:28:43,51
a knee ellis he was on the southern
side he worked in the docks and i'm

341
00:28:43,51 --> 00:28:49,58
a doctor there. And the
fellow name. He was

342
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:51,23
it was

343
00:28:52,43 --> 00:28:59,13
a church man i can't think of his name
but very religious and i think he was

344
00:28:59,13 --> 00:29:05,02
a type of church minister a funny
sort of a job for him to evers

345
00:29:05,02 --> 00:29:10,16
a boilermaker amongst tough men.
And i just can't remember his name

346
00:29:10,16 --> 00:29:16,92
a quote or some name like that was in the
salvation army. No i don't think it was

347
00:29:16,92 --> 00:29:23,32
a salvation army was in the i don't
know what denomination but it's hard

348
00:29:24,11 --> 00:29:25,20
it's hard to think of

349
00:29:25,20 --> 00:29:29,24
a try and remember the name just
too long ago for me i haven't got

350
00:29:29,24 --> 00:29:33,92
a good memory. Do you remember any of the
job delegates you were and worker when

351
00:29:33,92 --> 00:29:39,37
you. Yes. I doubt i can't remember the

352
00:29:42,16 --> 00:29:46,61
worker delicates but i can remember the
boilermaker delegate he was doyle he was an

353
00:29:46,61 --> 00:29:47,59
irishman a bit of

354
00:29:47,59 --> 00:29:54,38
a wild man. Can't remember my
delicate you did you later on

355
00:29:54,38 --> 00:29:55,50
become become

356
00:29:55,50 --> 00:30:01,55
a boilermaker to do you now. Now i went
from there to tram driving and finished up

357
00:30:01,55 --> 00:30:03,16
as a linesman for the
transport department.
