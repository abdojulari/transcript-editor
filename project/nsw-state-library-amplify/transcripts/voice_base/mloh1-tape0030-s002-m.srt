1
00:00:00,23 --> 00:00:06,88
Was no thirty to 1932 and he so might
want you chaps in the photo. And the way

2
00:00:07,59 --> 00:00:12,04
the better i said i mean i love all these
and that doesn't matter. I want you among

3
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:17,87
the heads of department i want the men
represented to so my my my we are in the

4
00:00:17,87 --> 00:00:22,99
photo and we got in the photo and these
are you come across to try and have

5
00:00:22,99 --> 00:00:29,50
a ride across the prime with us and we had
the privilege of being on that train and

6
00:00:29,50 --> 00:00:33,22
went across the first train and went
across arbour bridge because they read or

7
00:00:33,22 --> 00:00:38,24
after their lunch and we had to come back
to work. When he got on well with but

8
00:00:38,24 --> 00:00:42,56
redfield and with the engineers and whatever.
What about the foreman and going out

9
00:00:42,56 --> 00:00:49,32
in the public works. Well guess any on
that when we came back from the walk

10
00:00:50,03 --> 00:00:51,00
which we went mad

11
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:56,68
a couple of beers before we came back to
celebrate it. And the rope was there as

12
00:00:56,68 --> 00:01:01,76
you said well you fellows wait. I think we
have been across the bridge with. These

13
00:01:01,76 --> 00:01:05,03
and i think you've done enough for the day
that i think you better go out so we let

14
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:09,40
us go out that day but he
was a very trying to leave

15
00:01:09,40 --> 00:01:15,82
a low but some of the supervisors
were very nasty men.

16
00:01:16,46 --> 00:01:22,54
And then when one chap was very nasty
things to say about a man but. Now

17
00:01:22,54 --> 00:01:26,64
a lot of the gate was looking
for work and he promised to ask

18
00:01:26,64 --> 00:01:29,09
a couple of them they can sleep
with their wives and give them

19
00:01:29,09 --> 00:01:34,75
a job. And that really happened. I know
chapter that that happened. They tell me

20
00:01:34,75 --> 00:01:38,57
about it. So i know that was right
as a very sad thing of being

21
00:01:38,57 --> 00:01:41,80
a man that they were like that
and was very said i think

22
00:01:41,80 --> 00:01:43,30
a mandate that except that they get

23
00:01:43,30 --> 00:01:49,78
a job that really happened and that
time. It certainly was. Yeah it was so

24
00:01:50,89 --> 00:01:57,51
but. We were i think where we are
happy it was never any arguments or

25
00:01:57,51 --> 00:02:02,01
just friends and among men
and it was unionism with

26
00:02:02,01 --> 00:02:07,93
a very loud then and i was still in the
union the captain the union. We never ever

27
00:02:07,93 --> 00:02:13,37
saw anybody from the young. That the b w

28
00:02:13,37 --> 00:02:18,70
o you or the carpenters that was the
amalgamated trappers union at that time. I've

29
00:02:18,70 --> 00:02:24,46
been in the young and since 1921. First in
the progressive and then the amalgamated

30
00:02:24,46 --> 00:02:28,55
gardeners and then during the war
years they joined up in the b.w.

31
00:02:28,55 --> 00:02:35,29
I took over and still represent
the carpenters and i mean they

32
00:02:35,29 --> 00:02:41,59
represent all capital
communist inspired. With

33
00:02:41,60 --> 00:02:44,05
a good union by comparison to
the other one. But there was

34
00:02:44,05 --> 00:02:48,22
a period where i suppose
their organization was

35
00:02:48,22 --> 00:02:54,19
a very good. They. Sort of
the benefit of the work.

36
00:02:55,42 --> 00:02:56,00
There is a very

37
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:01,35
a growing grew gap and it became more
prevalent there were more chapters about

38
00:03:01,35 --> 00:03:06,30
a building was more strong.
The sydney started to build

39
00:03:06,30 --> 00:03:11,13
a lot of places on the grows naturally and
that produced more cars which makes the

40
00:03:11,13 --> 00:03:16,80
young and strong. Tell me something. If
you or your biography with when were you

41
00:03:16,80 --> 00:03:18,64
born. Mr.

42
00:03:18,65 --> 00:03:24,68
Milligan road born on the journey for
the november 1899 and makes me a

43
00:03:24,68 --> 00:03:26,96
b to know. My paper

44
00:03:26,96 --> 00:03:33,79
a french australian born out here where but
were you born. Maybe the united states

45
00:03:33,79 --> 00:03:40,73
it will operate. And where did you

46
00:03:40,73 --> 00:03:46,12
grow up and willem alluded to you in school
in the sydney harbour and down darling

47
00:03:46,12 --> 00:03:51,100
harbour. I can remember there's i can
remember sydney before we had trams we had

48
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:58,82
was buses member is about 9am for i lived
in darling harbour before the markets

49
00:03:58,82 --> 00:04:04,26
was built when the old paddy's markets was
going as the capital. Yet and now that's

50
00:04:04,26 --> 00:04:11,01
the original burma market and then i saw
the trams come on. And i've seen the trams

51
00:04:11,01 --> 00:04:15,25
you know i moved from the darling harbour
section down the well i'm eleven hours

52
00:04:15,25 --> 00:04:20,71
that all my parents died
in 1914. After that or

53
00:04:20,71 --> 00:04:26,92
a couple of years after i went to the world.
When did you first up were. No i mean

54
00:04:28,39 --> 00:04:32,73
i'm only i was fourteen or
thirteen and that when i go. I had

55
00:04:32,73 --> 00:04:37,77
a do there because we were pretty
hard up and we made money so i got

56
00:04:37,77 --> 00:04:41,88
a job. My first job was that
they'd buy but wait. In

57
00:04:41,88 --> 00:04:48,80
a chemist. And when you get your

58
00:04:49,64 --> 00:04:56,59
indentures is the tough to know that
it's another's doria. And though when i

59
00:04:56,59 --> 00:05:00,61
came back from the same job in the first
war. Well let's let's cover the first well

60
00:05:00,61 --> 00:05:04,68
when you went to the war. What did you do
there. Will you then when you enter the

61
00:05:04,68 --> 00:05:10,17
war. Well i noticed and seventeen that
i'd been in the cadets in the compulsory

62
00:05:10,17 --> 00:05:15,63
training and i let and i was very keen
soldiering and they'd make me go up and ceos

63
00:05:15,63 --> 00:05:21,10
girl now becoming ceo. I took on by
an authority and physical culture as

64
00:05:21,10 --> 00:05:24,21
a project and they kept me there for

65
00:05:24,21 --> 00:05:30,50
a while and i never got away.
Well either in 1918 and i

66
00:05:31,86 --> 00:05:32,73
get in england for

67
00:05:32,73 --> 00:05:38,90
a while and the world was nearly finished
runner i went over there. It was just

68
00:05:38,90 --> 00:05:45,78
about ready to go got over there and i
got no money. So i missed the war. I

69
00:05:45,78 --> 00:05:50,87
didn't see much of it. I never saw any
battles or anything. I just was over there

70
00:05:50,87 --> 00:05:51,24
and i was

71
00:05:51,24 --> 00:05:58,03
a lot of the seventeen but chalion don't
know me but still i was over there.

72
00:05:58,20 --> 00:06:03,60
Married. It was my fault. And when you got
back. Many of them managed to get your

73
00:06:03,60 --> 00:06:04,06
indentures

74
00:06:04,06 --> 00:06:11,00
a different and well when we came
home in 1919 in the meantime i had

75
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:17,74
learnt motor mechanic work in england and
i like being and i got and then from the

76
00:06:18,83 --> 00:06:24,34
vocational training. So the
repatriation department and i went

77
00:06:24,34 --> 00:06:28,28
a technical trail went there for
nine months and went out as

78
00:06:28,28 --> 00:06:34,49
a thirty per cent carbon day but instead
of that i realised and i don't believe me

79
00:06:34,49 --> 00:06:37,21
. Tried like this and i stayed

80
00:06:37,21 --> 00:06:43,31
a i asked for an extension and i stayed
there for. Two years at the technical

81
00:06:43,31 --> 00:06:46,89
trolley different parts of it
and i lived on two guineas

82
00:06:46,89 --> 00:06:52,55
a week for two years to learn my
trade and i was only there five days

83
00:06:52,55 --> 00:06:55,46
a week of the tech and i
reckon that was better than

84
00:06:55,46 --> 00:06:59,28
a and then apprenticeship because you had
trained men looking out you know all the

85
00:06:59,28 --> 00:07:05,07
time and i stayed there for two years
and i came out as a trust myself as

86
00:07:05,07 --> 00:07:12,02
a voter ids and that's that's the story.
If you and then you've got on the average

87
00:07:12,02 --> 00:07:18,03
no you got other jobs first but i was worked
on different types of jobs everywhere

88
00:07:18,03 --> 00:07:22,75
and sydney and them days you just went
around looking for work and you're going to

89
00:07:22,75 --> 00:07:27,30
work you might be fixing it. That's putting
doors windows and things like that

90
00:07:27,30 --> 00:07:33,60
finishing off and i'd do a roofing
job. And i'd get a country job and

91
00:07:33,61 --> 00:07:39,68
a big factory job. I know i worked
on gold for my watch big fire job in

92
00:07:41,27 --> 00:07:47,51
a month for about seven or eight months and
i'd done jobs in the country. But first

93
00:07:47,51 --> 00:07:48,16
rebuild

94
00:07:48,16 --> 00:07:52,90
a lot of power couple of places up there
and then gradually i weary of debate out

95
00:07:53,70 --> 00:07:58,66
doing jobs everywhere because you in the
building trade you don't stay in one place

96
00:07:58,66 --> 00:07:59,51
it just may have

97
00:07:59,51 --> 00:08:04,99
a bad. Doing that you get experience by
dependent doing different types of work

98
00:08:06,09 --> 00:08:13,05
place i'm living here i built
1928 this house. Still is

99
00:08:13,05 --> 00:08:19,31
as good as new this last room we're
in our build thirty years ago but

100
00:08:20,97 --> 00:08:26,58
i like my work. You know i'm very keen on
carpentry and. I even made my i'm for an

101
00:08:26,58 --> 00:08:33,20
extra bedrooms wait in queensland
to get my daughter from forty five

102
00:08:33,20 --> 00:08:40,09
shillings are hundred feet so far
in them days by the hour. And

103
00:08:40,10 --> 00:08:42,03
that solid queensland maple
as well not the near

104
00:08:42,03 --> 00:08:48,31
a they buy one boards. You
wouldn't buy that the money. Yes

105
00:08:49,12 --> 00:08:53,97
. Tell me when you were on the bridge.
Remember the working conditions being harder

106
00:08:53,97 --> 00:08:58,59
or easier than anywhere else. Now we just
done an ordinary day's work. We just

107
00:08:58,59 --> 00:09:03,90
naturally we didn't raise or race.
And we never let a jap with

108
00:09:03,90 --> 00:09:08,69
a whip overs but. I had one leading and
i can't think of his name but he lived

109
00:09:08,69 --> 00:09:13,51
locally but he was a very nice
fellow and. We all just worked as

110
00:09:13,51 --> 00:09:20,38
a team we just done the job properly
correctly and we used to grow up as these

111
00:09:20,38 --> 00:09:24,94
these these men and calmly care for him
directly. And we done everything right and

112
00:09:24,94 --> 00:09:31,75
it was never any mistakes without work. Yet
their work they were the idle light and

113
00:09:31,75 --> 00:09:37,72
we up there were everything was done precision
and although we camps just don't he

114
00:09:37,72 --> 00:09:43,49
working. And then being any of us broke our
back but we worked steady anyway all of

115
00:09:43,49 --> 00:09:50,40
mine. Where where were you in the bridge
was opened. I was on at that time i

116
00:09:50,40 --> 00:09:57,21
was. I was finished and i want
some shops underneath the

117
00:09:58,22 --> 00:10:03,09
mills and find station where the tram just
around i was on that side. That's where

118
00:10:03,09 --> 00:10:04,55
we built the shops enlivened by

119
00:10:04,55 --> 00:10:11,41
a road and we had finished.
The station management

120
00:10:11,41 --> 00:10:13,78
point station stairs and

121
00:10:14,86 --> 00:10:19,66
a concrete where they've been done earlier
of course and we'd been fixed and we

122
00:10:19,66 --> 00:10:23,73
were done all the fixing work and i was
one of the lucky ones that was kept on to

123
00:10:23,73 --> 00:10:30,30
do the finishing work and then we
built the last very doable as i

124
00:10:31,56 --> 00:10:37,37
pull the escalators down that went up to
the top now days. Now the escalators going

125
00:10:37,37 --> 00:10:41,33
up to the top when the ferries were there
after the ferries that was from the

126
00:10:42,40 --> 00:10:46,81
temperate temporary milton's point station
to lend street terms mansour over

127
00:10:46,81 --> 00:10:53,76
a month there and when we had to pull
that down we were tired from from

128
00:10:53,76 --> 00:10:58,76
the wharf which they aren't allowed to
park or you know that used to be the mills

129
00:10:58,76 --> 00:11:05,64
and points more and then we we fixed
the park out. I meant tidy the park

130
00:11:05,64 --> 00:11:10,41
up and put tree guards and things like that
round them. That was my last job them.

131
00:11:12,01 --> 00:11:17,24
To what happened the escalators. Now they
were both down. They were just destroyed

132
00:11:17,24 --> 00:11:21,69
i think sold or given away to something i
know i fell down to the top of the bottom

133
00:11:21,69 --> 00:11:28,51
ones that was my last job i skidded out
of the only places i did it was like

134
00:11:28,51 --> 00:11:35,25
that probably and you know it was the last
that was there. That was the last time i

135
00:11:35,25 --> 00:11:38,22
was there and then you
were on the dole for

136
00:11:38,22 --> 00:11:43,49
a while. Yes. Things were very very hard
after that until you start at this relief

137
00:11:43,49 --> 00:11:45,35
work. Allowed ease the situation

138
00:11:45,35 --> 00:11:52,25
a little bit before that you know you
just went down to them they worked about

139
00:11:52,25 --> 00:11:56,55
and. You've got a ticket to
get so much groceries and

140
00:11:56,56 --> 00:12:03,40
a mate. How weak and we are and we
started off getting at the intent. And i

141
00:12:03,40 --> 00:12:05,10
threw a big lump of my that your half

142
00:12:05,10 --> 00:12:08,47
a dozen loaves of bread didn't say kill
and so they're little they're you for the

143
00:12:08,47 --> 00:12:09,81
week and

144
00:12:10,93 --> 00:12:17,76
a very shame that they've got no way am
i that my bribed after that. But then

145
00:12:17,76 --> 00:12:23,39
when we got the relief where we got it in
cash. I mean we could use our money as we

146
00:12:23,39 --> 00:12:28,60
like tell me at that time when you when
you've got the coupons and then we had to

147
00:12:28,60 --> 00:12:32,87
draw the food for it. What did you do first
say cooking for the money for the gas

148
00:12:32,87 --> 00:12:38,70
or whatever and well where you just.
Look what we could do if i had

149
00:12:38,70 --> 00:12:44,90
a fuel's derivatives house at the time
and we had to cook most all on the field

150
00:12:44,90 --> 00:12:48,69
stivers we would now but i
don't but when i built a house

151
00:12:49,97 --> 00:12:56,29
a mining twenty eight. And you know couple
of i had up in the place. But i guess

152
00:12:56,29 --> 00:12:58,24
we're just managed and get

153
00:12:58,24 --> 00:13:04,95
a few shillings. We're good. And
there were deprived of that and.

154
00:13:05,59 --> 00:13:10,91
I was playing the place or up from the
bank the government savings bank state

155
00:13:10,91 --> 00:13:17,90
savings bank. They were very good to me
though even paid my rates here. I couldn't

156
00:13:17,90 --> 00:13:24,07
play anything i had no money and they don't
buy that while i have this unemployed

157
00:13:24,07 --> 00:13:30,87
coupon that they wouldn't allow it to
go carry i think for two years. They

158
00:13:31,74 --> 00:13:38,08
never they never i never paid anything but
pay their aup since of course. But they

159
00:13:38,08 --> 00:13:43,48
were very very good. There was when they
said they were never there. Presume

160
00:13:43,48 --> 00:13:46,33
a property. Jack lanning of course started

161
00:13:46,33 --> 00:13:52,26
a moratorium that out that out as he did
was dropped. Ms asian going back gives

162
00:13:52,26 --> 00:13:58,18
a shame that those chaps of got killed on
the bridge but no compensation because

163
00:13:58,18 --> 00:14:04,01
there was no medical compensation on them
days and they just at the take it. I'm

164
00:14:04,02 --> 00:14:07,30
afraid that they did get some would say
there was workers there wasn't one killed

165
00:14:07,30 --> 00:14:11,53
before 1926 when the workers compensation
started. They were all killed after all

166
00:14:11,53 --> 00:14:15,56
i'm wrong i thought it was after i
married jack lang deck lang was

167
00:14:15,56 --> 00:14:20,81
a man that put the workers compensation
act through which which was very had

168
00:14:20,81 --> 00:14:27,06
a hard very good. I know before that in
bad money trying to draw out an accident

169
00:14:28,07 --> 00:14:32,87
and no these great to me leg
my arms and i never got

170
00:14:32,87 --> 00:14:38,43
a pending out of it. That was that was
before compensation. Those or not. There

171
00:14:38,44 --> 00:14:42,27
none of you got involved in any accidents
around you on the bridge goings on and

172
00:14:42,27 --> 00:14:46,53
northern approaches. No i never had an
accident at all. I was very careful and i

173
00:14:46,53 --> 00:14:51,31
was a very able and i was a
very fit and them though. Being

174
00:14:51,31 --> 00:14:54,67
a young man of course i very able to do

175
00:14:54,67 --> 00:14:59,33
a good day's work which we did. One last
thing do you remember any funny stories

176
00:14:59,33 --> 00:15:05,64
that happened while you working over there.
Now i think that you know. You know the

177
00:15:05,64 --> 00:15:11,89
only one being that of memories of me
at my mates where we were fixing on the

178
00:15:11,89 --> 00:15:18,55
station in the writing room putting the
seats where building the state where

179
00:15:18,55 --> 00:15:24,42
everybody said and my i might just come
to work or mine. I'm used to like these

180
00:15:24,42 --> 00:15:29,91
drop romany used to eat garlic. Only merely
suffocate me was like boys and girls. I

181
00:15:29,91 --> 00:15:35,74
was talking about they would go outside
work. It could i couldn't stand the smell

182
00:15:35,74 --> 00:15:41,100
of some of the only thing i can say about
it. I mean yeah. The people that worked

183
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,57
on the. On the approaches were generally
australian born with. Ah yes you know i

184
00:15:46,57 --> 00:15:50,35
don't think there was any foreigners any
of them there weren't that many out of

185
00:15:50,35 --> 00:15:55,61
that time that was before the influx of
immigrants but most of them are astray

186
00:15:55,61 --> 00:16:00,41
liam's i can say that now everybody
army or i think was on australian

187
00:16:01,21 --> 00:16:05,74
a lot of them were out there for well for
us war diggers do that came back. You

188
00:16:05,74 --> 00:16:10,90
know they one of the job. But then
i think we were just a mixed crowd

189
00:16:10,90 --> 00:16:17,80
a purist railings in them days. A man
that was recognised in the tried

190
00:16:18,56 --> 00:16:22,11
but you did a good hard day's
work all the time allotted hours

191
00:16:22,11 --> 00:16:27,18
a day already four hours a
week and body tony hours

192
00:16:27,18 --> 00:16:33,74
a week they brought it down to after but
in them days everybody worked well and

193
00:16:33,75 --> 00:16:36,16
we're crunching answers like today as

194
00:16:36,16 --> 00:16:42,89
a little bit different. Do you remember
what you used to do in the spare

195
00:16:42,89 --> 00:16:43,54
time when you had

196
00:16:43,54 --> 00:16:47,24
a little bit of money in your pocket when
you before you were married and then

197
00:16:47,24 --> 00:16:53,48
after that. Well you know if i was married
i was saving up to buy this block of

198
00:16:53,48 --> 00:16:59,87
land i'm on now and build my house. My
people died when i was between loreen and

199
00:16:59,87 --> 00:17:06,50
fifteen. My mother and father my mother
died three months i have to my father she

200
00:17:06,50 --> 00:17:06,64
was

201
00:17:06,64 --> 00:17:13,78
a beast got buried genes. My father was
friends. And there were very happy family

202
00:17:13,78 --> 00:17:20,42
. But or very poor because at the time
and i was i was and i was living with

203
00:17:20,42 --> 00:17:23,66
my sister punchbowl which was

204
00:17:23,66 --> 00:17:30,18
a scrubby place there was no houses
i think there back in 1915 that

205
00:17:30,19 --> 00:17:36,44
my brother first and his wife died twelve
months after my mother and they went of

206
00:17:36,44 --> 00:17:42,65
the world and 1916 the elder brother
and me we had no home at all. And

207
00:17:43,69 --> 00:17:44,84
so i was always wanting

208
00:17:44,84 --> 00:17:51,01
a home amount and the only way i got it. I
bet i don't scrape to my i didn't go for

209
00:17:51,01 --> 00:17:57,59
much. I mean as means except fishing which
is cheap. And that was my only sports

210
00:17:57,59 --> 00:18:04,47
which it is deal and i saved my
money as best i could i never drank

211
00:18:04,47 --> 00:18:05,89
and i never smoked in them days

212
00:18:06,71 --> 00:18:11,66
a good employer. And i didn't waste my money
because i wanted to save the money the

213
00:18:11,66 --> 00:18:17,23
builders house which i did. Now it's
my home and many wouldn't buy it.

214
00:18:19,21 --> 00:18:20,43
Thank you very much risk of elegant.
