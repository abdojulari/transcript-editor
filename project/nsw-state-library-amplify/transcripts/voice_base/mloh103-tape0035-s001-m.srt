1
00:00:12,92 --> 00:00:17,49
Ok. I had my. Mask. Three beans.

2
00:00:18,37 --> 00:00:23,50
Universe two cultures.

3
00:00:25,59 --> 00:00:29,71
Sure. Col. James. Fifty seven.

4
00:00:30,74 --> 00:00:32,27
And i work at the university of sydney

5
00:00:32,27 --> 00:00:36,69
and i've been here for about 15 years
still doing a lot of the things

6
00:00:36,69 --> 00:00:39,71
that i did when the pride
of aquarius festival.

7
00:00:39,87 --> 00:00:43,12
I was tutoring here and at the
university new south wales

8
00:00:44,49 --> 00:00:49,22
and was my involvement with sakic just
dudes who were also interested in.

9
00:00:49,24 --> 00:00:53,34
The ideologies that and the protest and
the radical movements of that time.

10
00:00:53,82 --> 00:00:58,30
And who desperately wanted to be involved
in exploring some of those paths

11
00:00:58,30 --> 00:01:01,06
and it was through that university
commitment and the fact

12
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:04,65
that the aquarius festival was a straight

13
00:01:04,66 --> 00:01:11,26
and union of students event that we
could quite legitimately get involved

14
00:01:11,26 --> 00:01:16,13
and i was capable because i worked also
in new south wales of involving the

15
00:01:16,13 --> 00:01:18,87
students architecture
students at both universities

16
00:01:18,87 --> 00:01:22,49
and they were very keen i must say
i didn't have to do too much.

17
00:01:22,50 --> 00:01:25,98
Coercing and there was a solid group
of students from new south wales

18
00:01:25,98 --> 00:01:29,07
and from sydney who got
involved in the planning

19
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:34,07
and in the construction of some of
the facilities for the festival

20
00:01:35,53 --> 00:01:40,52
but prior to that though i can recall
very early in the piece maybe a year

21
00:01:40,52 --> 00:01:41,75
or two year

22
00:01:41,75 --> 00:01:46,39
and a half perhaps before the festival
started being approached by johnny allen

23
00:01:46,39 --> 00:01:50,41
dunston. And i can recall
my first meeting with them.

24
00:01:50,46 --> 00:01:53,63
I knew john anyway from the
yellow house of kings cross

25
00:01:53,63 --> 00:01:59,28
but i we had a meeting at my office at
the time which was in the bakery at.

26
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,40
Thing to. And we were
talking about the festival

27
00:02:04,40 --> 00:02:07,90
and how it might be set up
and where it might be set up

28
00:02:08,88 --> 00:02:15,63
and about some of the ideas that might
might be be brought to bear on it and i.

29
00:02:16,10 --> 00:02:19,88
I remember at that stage i think
it was graham dunstan was saying

30
00:02:19,88 --> 00:02:25,14
that they both of them were attracted
to the area around mullumbimby

31
00:02:25,14 --> 00:02:30,75
but for various reasons. It
may not. May not occur there.

32
00:02:31,59 --> 00:02:35,64
But that general region which i forget
who coined the word road by region

33
00:02:35,64 --> 00:02:38,56
but it was that region that
we we were talking about.

34
00:02:39,94 --> 00:02:45,79
And i can remember advancing.
The idea since of.

35
00:02:46,65 --> 00:02:47,52
Working to try

36
00:02:47,52 --> 00:02:53,08
and have a larger agenda for the festival
to help to with the decentralization

37
00:02:53,08 --> 00:02:57,54
movement because i had just done a job
for the department of decentralisation

38
00:02:57,54 --> 00:03:00,26
through the university of new england
about a town called mcclain.

39
00:03:00,73 --> 00:03:04,03
Where i'd had a lot of contact
with local townspeople

40
00:03:04,03 --> 00:03:09,52
and also farmers from the district and
they were very sad about the fact

41
00:03:09,52 --> 00:03:11,74
that their kids were leaving
home and going to the city

42
00:03:11,74 --> 00:03:15,14
and not continuing the rural tradition.

43
00:03:15,15 --> 00:03:19,85
And the townspeople were also very
keen to attract. Development.

44
00:03:19,96 --> 00:03:23,53
They will looking at their town declining
and the population declining and.

45
00:03:24,13 --> 00:03:26,97
They were very worried
about about the future

46
00:03:27,78 --> 00:03:32,38
and what i was therefore was to help
sort of plan a strategy for the future.

47
00:03:32,54 --> 00:03:36,72
So this was very conscious
of that and i remember.

48
00:03:36,74 --> 00:03:42,58
Relating this to john in graeme saying
that. There was this problem of.

49
00:03:42,97 --> 00:03:46,27
Of a concentration of population
moving to the big cities

50
00:03:47,04 --> 00:03:51,00
and the rural areas hadn't
been able to attract either.

51
00:03:52,69 --> 00:03:56,91
New settlements or business
like or new rural developments

52
00:03:57,73 --> 00:03:59,74
and it was a known fact
that the north coast.

53
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,12
In particular the dairy
industry was declining

54
00:04:03,17 --> 00:04:07,38
and no matter how much funding the department
a decentralized asian injected into

55
00:04:07,38 --> 00:04:09,01
it didn't seem to address that decline.

56
00:04:09,18 --> 00:04:13,72
So i mean we were trying to look at a
bigger picture as well as having a festival

57
00:04:13,72 --> 00:04:16,36
and enjoying the fruits of that.

58
00:04:17,60 --> 00:04:23,02
And it was also from a from my point of
view university involvement it was a great

59
00:04:23,02 --> 00:04:28,66
time to try some experiments
and to see what would work.

60
00:04:28,67 --> 00:04:35,46
Well. I can remember being in them but.

61
00:04:36,02 --> 00:04:39,86
Being in. I think we in lismore
we met up at least more

62
00:04:39,86 --> 00:04:41,74
and i think it was tom's
a brisk he had a car

63
00:04:42,85 --> 00:04:47,15
and there were four of us there including
tom and graham and john in the self

64
00:04:48,14 --> 00:04:52,75
and i think we were cruising the area
looking for inspiration and sites

65
00:04:53,82 --> 00:04:55,57
and i think graham in
particular was very keen.

66
00:04:56,17 --> 00:05:02,76
Finding something like a wilderness
area like a wonderful place to be into

67
00:05:02,76 --> 00:05:04,09
and to have a festival

68
00:05:04,09 --> 00:05:09,81
and to be in a fairly unfettered
way try out a lot of new systems

69
00:05:11,08 --> 00:05:13,56
and so i suppose we were
looking for a special site.

70
00:05:15,14 --> 00:05:20,14
I mean none of us would talk seriously
about recycling a town at that stage.

71
00:05:20,16 --> 00:05:23,25
And i remember when we first
sight of the nimbin rocks.

72
00:05:23,92 --> 00:05:28,93
It was such a powerful impact that
everybody just said you know. Wow.

73
00:05:29,26 --> 00:05:32,08
This has to be the site
somewhere around here

74
00:05:32,08 --> 00:05:36,25
and i think the first instinct was to say
let's have a festival at the foothills of

75
00:05:36,25 --> 00:05:39,78
the rocks.

76
00:05:39,80 --> 00:05:41,56
Not knowing if it's
aboriginal significance

77
00:05:41,56 --> 00:05:44,18
or anything else other than the fact
there was just a very powerful place

78
00:05:44,18 --> 00:05:48,88
that we continued on and to
explore. You know around.

79
00:05:49,28 --> 00:05:53,32
Around the place and then we found
that when we came into the town

80
00:05:53,32 --> 00:05:59,89
and it was a village it was. It was. Worse
than mcclane in a sense in that it it.

81
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,79
There's almost a mint condition there only
to village with there's only one shop

82
00:06:03,79 --> 00:06:08,11
alive. Very little action in the
streets and hardly anyone around

83
00:06:09,73 --> 00:06:12,80
and i can recall then saying this.

84
00:06:14,03 --> 00:06:14,76
This is the place

85
00:06:15,86 --> 00:06:22,43
and i suppose i mean it was the connection
between this almost a film set village

86
00:06:22,43 --> 00:06:28,24
and the membrane rocks
that created that sort of.

87
00:06:30,15 --> 00:06:31,78
The notion that. Yeah we'd found the place

88
00:06:31,78 --> 00:06:37,28
and now we should sort of
concentrate on what to do with it.

89
00:06:39,06 --> 00:06:43,06
I think what the sequence
events after that was basically

90
00:06:43,07 --> 00:06:45,14
that one of the things

91
00:06:45,14 --> 00:06:49,44
that having just done the town exercise
was very conscious of participating with

92
00:06:49,44 --> 00:06:53,19
local people. And i did suggest

93
00:06:53,19 --> 00:06:56,53
that before we did too much else we
should have a meeting with the town

94
00:06:57,30 --> 00:06:57,89
and set up a meeting

95
00:06:57,89 --> 00:07:03,17
and start to negotiate whether in fact
the town people wanted just here he way.

96
00:07:03,18 --> 00:07:07,69
But i felt sure they would because
of that background of. Involving.

97
00:07:08,17 --> 00:07:12,53
And wanting to involve young
people in in rural values

98
00:07:12,53 --> 00:07:16,65
and the opportunity to start new lives
i mean i think that the townspeople

99
00:07:16,65 --> 00:07:20,08
and the organizers of the conference
had had a lot of common ground.

100
00:07:22,47 --> 00:07:25,60
And i actually wasn't there when
that when those meetings occurred.

101
00:07:26,57 --> 00:07:31,14
I had i went off to china.

102
00:07:32,13 --> 00:07:33,82
For a educational visit.

103
00:07:35,68 --> 00:07:42,05
Now in our meetings before i went though
we did talk about whether it should be a

104
00:07:42,05 --> 00:07:43,96
wilderness site.

105
00:07:43,98 --> 00:07:50,03
Or whether it should be what i was opting
for which was a degraded site like the

106
00:07:50,03 --> 00:07:56,46
place where the impact of having x thousand
number of people for a couple of weeks

107
00:07:56,46 --> 00:07:59,86
wouldn't. Wouldn't destroy
the site and i mean i was.

108
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:01,30
Very conscious of the fact

109
00:08:01,30 --> 00:08:08,32
that the impact having been to other

110
00:08:08,33 --> 00:08:10,70
events like that. I mean.

111
00:08:10,71 --> 00:08:13,77
I don't remember and several others i
was aware that you know there was a.

112
00:08:15,23 --> 00:08:20,26
There was a terrific potential
impact of so many people.

113
00:08:21,56 --> 00:08:27,21
And the idea of finding sites close to the
town to sort of close to the village to

114
00:08:27,21 --> 00:08:30,02
breathe life into the place and the fact

115
00:08:30,02 --> 00:08:33,92
that there was already a transport
connection to lismore there was already some

116
00:08:33,92 --> 00:08:37,36
what's a vacant shops and one shop
but there were facilities there

117
00:08:37,36 --> 00:08:41,28
that could very could i add
the idea of a festival

118
00:08:42,16 --> 00:08:44,98
and without having to put all the expensive
infrastructure because there was a

119
00:08:44,98 --> 00:08:50,26
budgetary problem anyway about bringing
in water and handling transport

120
00:08:50,26 --> 00:08:53,92
and also controlling it. I
mean as a police station.

121
00:08:54,10 --> 00:08:57,27
If they're not that that was a factor
but it was a hospital and things like

122
00:08:57,27 --> 00:09:04,08
that which were in the event were you
know useful things to have around.

123
00:09:05,29 --> 00:09:06,79
So.

124
00:09:06,81 --> 00:09:08,36
It more or less that all down

125
00:09:08,36 --> 00:09:12,40
that you know we wouldn't go
over the rocks at them in rocks.

126
00:09:12,67 --> 00:09:16,21
I don't think that site was
made available anyway.

127
00:09:16,22 --> 00:09:19,75
And i don't know i didn't pursue.

128
00:09:19,77 --> 00:09:21,86
As to whether we could use that site

129
00:09:21,86 --> 00:09:25,88
but we did talk very seriously with the
owners of the sites closest to the main

130
00:09:25,88 --> 00:09:32,04
street of nimbin one of whom acquiesced
to to letting us use the site

131
00:09:32,04 --> 00:09:32,81
and the other one didn't.

132
00:09:33,04 --> 00:09:38,36
So most of our planning work was
concentrated on the site where the festival

133
00:09:38,36 --> 00:09:39,12
actually occurred.

134
00:09:39,67 --> 00:09:46,26
And the idea of the street being part of
the the festival was actually endorsed by

135
00:09:46,26 --> 00:09:49,61
the by the local. The local people.

136
00:09:52,48 --> 00:09:59,14
You know. The time. Sure.

137
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,53
The general idea of
recycling was very strong.

138
00:10:03,55 --> 00:10:05,73
I mean we were talking about
recycling all sorts of things.

139
00:10:05,91 --> 00:10:09,18
I mean no one of the actually jumped
the scale up to recycling a town but.

140
00:10:10,61 --> 00:10:14,37
I mean it was a natural extension
of recycling waste materials

141
00:10:14,37 --> 00:10:17,73
or we saw recycling building
materials or recycling anything.

142
00:10:17,90 --> 00:10:22,44
I mean rather than putting
energy into new products.

143
00:10:22,49 --> 00:10:24,63
I mean that was very much
part of the ideology and

144
00:10:24,63 --> 00:10:28,90
that found form in the idea of recycling
a town and not building a lot of stuff

145
00:10:28,90 --> 00:10:29,67
that was already there.

146
00:10:31,57 --> 00:10:37,37
There was a lot of interest in things
like solar energy i mean what.

147
00:10:37,38 --> 00:10:42,28
What in fact is probably now one of the
centres of some who see this is found its

148
00:10:42,28 --> 00:10:44,36
place in them and.

149
00:10:44,38 --> 00:10:47,85
There was a lot of the stuff that
came out of the whole earth catalog

150
00:10:47,85 --> 00:10:50,60
and the thinking that came out of there.

151
00:10:50,61 --> 00:10:57,08
People were very anxious to explore like
building their own structures minimally.

152
00:10:57,09 --> 00:10:59,36
And in fact you know it was a venue.

153
00:10:59,49 --> 00:11:05,42
Most people who came there came with the
idea of building new sorts of structures.

154
00:11:05,44 --> 00:11:10,78
Also ideas about using waste.

155
00:11:10,80 --> 00:11:12,75
Methane to gestures and things like that.

156
00:11:13,97 --> 00:11:16,59
To handle sewage and other
sort of waste water.

157
00:11:17,14 --> 00:11:22,46
There was intense interest in
vegetarianism and new ways of of cooking

158
00:11:23,25 --> 00:11:24,85
and also in.

159
00:11:25,79 --> 00:11:32,34
Eating different sort of products starting
there was a growing interest in soybeans

160
00:11:32,35 --> 00:11:33,57
and.

161
00:11:36,24 --> 00:11:43,00
Many things like that goat's
cheeses and. And also in fruit.

162
00:11:43,15 --> 00:11:44,54
You know there was it was no accident.

163
00:11:44,98 --> 00:11:49,81
People used to say people went round
there with banana grins on their faces.

164
00:11:49,83 --> 00:11:53,54
And it's no accident. Also that the
rainbow cafe started up as sort of a.

165
00:11:53,94 --> 00:11:59,22
Very all you know a challenging
sort of food venue that.

166
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,88
And peeled a lot of people specially was
opposite the hotel i mean there was a

167
00:12:02,88 --> 00:12:07,73
there was a mainstream culture going on
one side of the street with hamburgers

168
00:12:07,73 --> 00:12:12,08
and beer and there was another culture
dead opposite going for soya burgers

169
00:12:12,08 --> 00:12:17,31
and green tea and things like
that. But from my point of view.

170
00:12:17,34 --> 00:12:19,46
I mean i was i'm a
planner and an architect

171
00:12:19,46 --> 00:12:21,48
and i was very interested in my students

172
00:12:21,48 --> 00:12:28,20
and ourselves being involved in in
designing and constructing the facilities.

173
00:12:28,23 --> 00:12:34,55
So we actually our part of
the idea was to design.

174
00:12:34,57 --> 00:12:38,59
And designate the camping areas and
the commune and the facilities areas

175
00:12:38,59 --> 00:12:45,16
and the systems which would at least maintain
several thousand people for a couple

176
00:12:45,16 --> 00:12:48,87
of couple of weeks and we did that

177
00:12:48,87 --> 00:12:53,10
and i am especially was the sort
of was our client in that regard.

178
00:12:53,16 --> 00:12:58,88
I mean he was the one who basically either
endorse the ideas or challenge them and.

179
00:12:59,54 --> 00:13:04,28
And you know we did other things
but we did have a lot of contact.

180
00:13:04,30 --> 00:13:08,85
I remember with the army when they were
extremely helpful in in how to handle

181
00:13:08,85 --> 00:13:12,97
that many people on on frail sites

182
00:13:13,86 --> 00:13:17,91
and we also had a lot of contact with
the state emergency services in lismore

183
00:13:18,90 --> 00:13:23,93
and we had many many meetings with
the local with the shire council.

184
00:13:24,89 --> 00:13:27,48
Because ultimately i suppose they
and the state emergency service

185
00:13:28,29 --> 00:13:31,82
and the army if it was necessary might
have gotten involved somewhere along the

186
00:13:31,82 --> 00:13:36,24
line. But as far as the services were
concerned. They had a health priority.

187
00:13:36,87 --> 00:13:40,20
And the responsibility for health
and we we were conscious of that.

188
00:13:41,63 --> 00:13:46,48
So we did opt for toilets
as being the best option.

189
00:13:48,03 --> 00:13:50,72
And we had the local
lectures to authority come

190
00:13:50,72 --> 00:13:55,31
and dig dig they did post holes
basically but in the sense

191
00:13:55,31 --> 00:13:59,86
that pit toilets act.

192
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,50
Only was a sort of crude way of recycling
sewage because wherever the pit toilets

193
00:14:05,50 --> 00:14:07,87
where we had planned an
orchard to take its place.

194
00:14:09,53 --> 00:14:12,24
What was revolutionary i think
was that the pit toilets were.

195
00:14:12,78 --> 00:14:16,79
Were community all and they
were sex they were sexless too

196
00:14:16,79 --> 00:14:21,29
and i mean the one of
my during memories is.

197
00:14:22,10 --> 00:14:26,45
A group of people sitting in a circle.
Having a crap and having a good time.

198
00:14:26,48 --> 00:14:30,64
If you got extraordinarily and
i mean the things like privacy

199
00:14:30,64 --> 00:14:35,53
and modesty just were
blown out the window.

200
00:14:36,25 --> 00:14:39,65
I must say that when we planned that we
did have we did have them in circles

201
00:14:39,65 --> 00:14:44,96
that we had a bit of privacy
enforced. The camping areas.

202
00:14:45,11 --> 00:14:51,03
I mean the priority was given to committee
facilities like there was a health like

203
00:14:51,03 --> 00:14:52,90
a hospital place for emergencies.

204
00:14:53,75 --> 00:14:55,36
There were places where cooking was done

205
00:14:55,36 --> 00:14:58,69
and where there was access
to the creek water.

206
00:15:00,51 --> 00:15:04,11
The sites for the camping were
well away from the creek.

207
00:15:04,11 --> 00:15:06,65
We're very conscious of the
fact that people could.

208
00:15:06,67 --> 00:15:09,03
You know pollute the
groundwater very easily.

209
00:15:10,51 --> 00:15:14,80
So where the where the pitch were dug also
real careful not to penetrate the water

210
00:15:14,80 --> 00:15:15,99
table and it would have contributed.

211
00:15:18,17 --> 00:15:23,53
And we used a lot of cheap materials
like parachutes and poles and.

212
00:15:24,50 --> 00:15:29,54
Like the the toilets themselves were just
hessian and posts and pits and we did.

213
00:15:30,23 --> 00:15:32,83
Hire pans that came in.

214
00:15:32,93 --> 00:15:38,54
All those squatting toilets were very
fashionable into we we did a lot of we built

215
00:15:38,54 --> 00:15:43,78
a lot of. Footprint type squatting
toilets. So when you went to the toilet.

216
00:15:44,07 --> 00:15:47,03
You had an option of a squatter or a pan.

217
00:15:48,03 --> 00:15:54,19
The water system we just basically we did
collect water of rooms where we we could

218
00:15:54,19 --> 00:15:59,89
do it but we relied on town
water and also the creek. The.

219
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,32
Gray water.

220
00:16:01,34 --> 00:16:04,97
From cooking and other places was
put into salix pits that day

221
00:16:06,38 --> 00:16:12,96
and the the general planning of the of
the festival designated parking areas

222
00:16:12,96 --> 00:16:16,47
and places where people like checkpoints
so people when they came into town

223
00:16:17,53 --> 00:16:18,94
or came out of the camping sites.

224
00:16:19,73 --> 00:16:21,66
You know had entrance fees and things like

225
00:16:21,66 --> 00:16:28,33
that. These.

226
00:16:29,37 --> 00:16:31,96
Tepees were very interesting.

227
00:16:32,51 --> 00:16:35,56
I mean a lot of people would normally
surmount of effort into their like was almost

228
00:16:35,56 --> 00:16:42,41
like a display village of g-d
domes tepees recycled a lot of

229
00:16:42,41 --> 00:16:45,32
bamboo because people found
bamboo in the region

230
00:16:45,32 --> 00:16:50,54
and they persuaded some farmers to let them
have a lot of natural materials people

231
00:16:50,54 --> 00:16:54,92
did earth brick construction.

232
00:16:56,86 --> 00:16:59,72
The favored materials were
natural materials means to say

233
00:16:59,72 --> 00:17:05,73
or recycle materials like people
building things out of our member. One.

234
00:17:06,28 --> 00:17:09,29
Dear d extractor was build out of.

235
00:17:10,64 --> 00:17:13,32
I think it's starting to many
a bit of something like that

236
00:17:13,32 --> 00:17:17,11
that the northern star throughout
all these printing plates

237
00:17:17,11 --> 00:17:21,79
and someone found a use where they could
actually. Tip of the gather they had a.

238
00:17:22,13 --> 00:17:24,46
Unusual looking judy's extraction.

239
00:17:25,01 --> 00:17:29,94
But one tenth of course and
caravans we all structures

240
00:17:31,01 --> 00:17:34,74
but the most extraordinary ones i think
were enormous spans done in bamboo using

241
00:17:34,74 --> 00:17:40,00
geodesic principles. There.

242
00:17:40,17 --> 00:17:41,35
One of the things

243
00:17:41,35 --> 00:17:46,68
that the army helped us with so was they
set us up with might have been emergency

244
00:17:46,68 --> 00:17:53,31
services set us up with a telephone
wireless telephone system.

245
00:17:53,80 --> 00:17:57,23
Which and some of the students
got involved in being more

246
00:17:57,23 --> 00:17:59,92
or less like like a foreman is on.

247
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,35
Building job and there was
a couple of really good.

248
00:18:03,37 --> 00:18:07,95
Women students that started to do
all of that sort of on site workers

249
00:18:09,65 --> 00:18:13,75
and the students who were deployed
into you know various work teams and.

250
00:18:14,20 --> 00:18:18,38
I think i haven't. I do remember now was.

251
00:18:19,17 --> 00:18:21,89
I think there was a very
low ebb like graeme

252
00:18:21,89 --> 00:18:26,60
and a number of supporters had moved
into name but and the living there.

253
00:18:28,41 --> 00:18:30,40
And i recall that they were i'd heard

254
00:18:30,40 --> 00:18:32,91
that they are very sad because they didn't
think anything was going to happen no

255
00:18:32,91 --> 00:18:35,69
one of the right on the side no one.

256
00:18:35,71 --> 00:18:41,09
And then we all went up on a on a big
bus like a whole load of us we had a 80

257
00:18:41,10 --> 00:18:45,35
seater bus. And we arrived at
neiman in the middle of the night.

258
00:18:46,11 --> 00:18:49,57
But it wasn't middle of the night
it was about. The dinner time.

259
00:18:50,93 --> 00:18:55,11
And we just arrived in the main
street of nimbin and graeme

260
00:18:55,12 --> 00:19:01,36
and a few other people were eating in
the daisies cafe which was the one

261
00:19:01,36 --> 00:19:05,20
that was just certainly this injection of
energy like just the numbers of people

262
00:19:05,20 --> 00:19:07,06
who are enthusiastic and committed and

263
00:19:07,06 --> 00:19:09,70
that sort of you know things
just started to fire from there.

264
00:19:10,75 --> 00:19:13,64
So we moved onto the sites
and started work and.

265
00:19:15,01 --> 00:19:20,32
That must have been about i don't know
four weeks or so before the thing started.

266
00:19:23,07 --> 00:19:27,86
But. I mean it was good. Good for
students good for us and the systems.

267
00:19:27,88 --> 00:19:31,83
You know they were primitive but they
worked and there were no health outbreaks.

268
00:19:33,57 --> 00:19:35,44
There were health problems
people did get sick.

269
00:19:35,88 --> 00:19:41,28
And there were there were some problems

270
00:19:41,28 --> 00:19:43,92
but they weren't messes i mean
coping with that amount of people

271
00:19:45,01 --> 00:19:46,60
and the council were basically happy

272
00:19:46,60 --> 00:19:50,65
and the emergency stardom urgency people
didn't get involved the army would call in

273
00:19:52,47 --> 00:19:53,68
the coppers paid a few visits

274
00:19:53,68 --> 00:19:59,81
but generally speaking the
place worked except i mean.

275
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,29
A lot of people were experimenting with.

276
00:20:03,91 --> 00:20:05,25
Knocking down a lot of inhibitions

277
00:20:05,25 --> 00:20:11,33
and whilst the townspeople had welcomed
the idea when the actual thing occurred.

278
00:20:11,43 --> 00:20:14,45
I mean they were confronted
with extraordinary.

279
00:20:14,46 --> 00:20:18,69
Assault on their senses and on their
ideas about modesty and privacy

280
00:20:18,69 --> 00:20:21,43
and drug use and all sorts of things.

281
00:20:21,62 --> 00:20:27,87
I mean it was just extraordinary
the the battering that.

282
00:20:27,89 --> 00:20:32,31
I think but they got what
they wanted. Basically they.

283
00:20:32,33 --> 00:20:37,30
They got thousands of people they had
an incredible injection of funds

284
00:20:37,30 --> 00:20:43,86
and energy and into the place and.

285
00:20:43,88 --> 00:20:48,99
After first it was over i was
involved in setting up the afternoon

286
00:20:48,99 --> 00:20:51,24
and what meetings.

287
00:20:51,26 --> 00:20:56,07
Because we had been we had realised
during the course the festival

288
00:20:56,07 --> 00:20:59,05
that you know a lot of people are
getting very committed to staying there

289
00:21:00,01 --> 00:21:04,17
and we're quite anxious to try and
purchase some key properties to.

290
00:21:04,18 --> 00:21:04,97
To make sure

291
00:21:04,97 --> 00:21:08,63
that we you know we weren't going to get
done over by the real estate people in the

292
00:21:08,63 --> 00:21:10,24
area and some people didn't.

293
00:21:10,43 --> 00:21:12,25
I mean the tomato sauce filling was a card

294
00:21:12,25 --> 00:21:14,66
and there were some other props
the rainbow cafe and things like

295
00:21:14,66 --> 00:21:17,83
that were required and i think

296
00:21:17,83 --> 00:21:23,17
and carnival falls was a call so.

297
00:21:23,18 --> 00:21:27,76
That's really where terry mcgarry
though came to prominence. I mean he.

298
00:21:27,78 --> 00:21:29,91
Who gradually took over those meetings

299
00:21:29,91 --> 00:21:35,76
and the running really was all the
people when whilst. As a planner.

300
00:21:35,87 --> 00:21:38,36
I was interested in the
afternoon but what idea

301
00:21:38,36 --> 00:21:43,70
and certainly wanted to help facilitate
what i got into the thing believing

302
00:21:43,70 --> 00:21:46,38
that you know he was something

303
00:21:46,38 --> 00:21:50,43
that decentralize it was actually
decentralization it was happening.

304
00:21:50,50 --> 00:21:53,51
It was about lifestyle it wasn't
about industry or anything else.

305
00:21:53,74 --> 00:21:59,81
It was about people wanting a different
life. But the people who. Who.

306
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,31
I formed the core groups out of the
afternoon the what meetings actually.

307
00:22:04,90 --> 00:22:09,46
With a core group that then
purchase tangible falls and.

308
00:22:09,48 --> 00:22:11,84
And set up the robo cafe

309
00:22:11,84 --> 00:22:16,75
and started tomato sauce as
a sort of a drop in centre

310
00:22:16,75 --> 00:22:19,50
and then eventually got
involved in the schooling and.

311
00:22:20,10 --> 00:22:22,86
The birthing center and the
media center and i mean it.

312
00:22:24,05 --> 00:22:38,87
You know even what is what is now.

313
00:22:38,89 --> 00:22:44,03
Oh yeah i just i mean at the time i was
living with a bunch of other people in

314
00:22:44,03 --> 00:22:45,84
castle cragg right on the waterfront.

315
00:22:46,20 --> 00:22:51,37
I mean it was it took half an hour to get
there because there was a 200 foot cliff

316
00:22:51,37 --> 00:22:55,33
you had to climb up and down and it was
one of those sort of left over places

317
00:22:55,33 --> 00:22:56,87
but no idea like.

318
00:22:56,89 --> 00:23:01,10
I mean i had found nothing that would
have compared with the lifestyle there.

319
00:23:01,28 --> 00:23:03,35
I mean we had a wonderful time we had.

320
00:23:05,30 --> 00:23:09,44
Canoeing and we had a pearl
and we had our own gardens

321
00:23:09,44 --> 00:23:13,41
and as far as i was concerned we were
doing it anyway but i must say that

322
00:23:16,10 --> 00:23:20,61
when my mother died which is around that
time i inherited a little bit of money

323
00:23:20,61 --> 00:23:25,92
and i went off and i bought a property
on the hawkesbury river which was.

324
00:23:27,43 --> 00:23:29,99
I mean that was my move to decentralize

325
00:23:31,32 --> 00:23:34,06
and i guess a lot of people worried
about nuclear war and things like that

326
00:23:34,06 --> 00:23:37,09
and i was certainly very
interested in autonomy.

327
00:23:38,99 --> 00:23:42,16
And there's two things
i did one was to set.

328
00:23:42,23 --> 00:23:48,78
I found a derelict old house on the
hawkesbury which i've got students involved

329
00:23:48,78 --> 00:23:52,69
and we've we had a commune there and we
actually started to fix up the house

330
00:23:52,69 --> 00:23:57,06
and the gardens and that move
towards self-sufficiency

331
00:23:58,45 --> 00:23:59,93
and i still in.

332
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:00,61
Your teaching

333
00:24:00,61 --> 00:24:04,85
and one of the things we did at the university
was build the thomas house which is

334
00:24:04,85 --> 00:24:09,58
built entirely out of recycled
materials and that had solar hot water

335
00:24:09,58 --> 00:24:14,24
and it had a solar a conditioning
system and the methane the jester

336
00:24:14,24 --> 00:24:16,82
and associated gardens

337
00:24:16,82 --> 00:24:22,93
and several of the students lived
there for four years only university.

338
00:24:22,95 --> 00:24:25,39
Wanted to get rid of it
and when it benefits

339
00:24:25,39 --> 00:24:28,12
that we get it up in the first place
that it's lasted for four years.

340
00:24:28,46 --> 00:24:35,04
Let it wind generators i mean
it was an extraordinary sight

341
00:24:35,76 --> 00:24:36,84
on a on a campus.

342
00:24:36,95 --> 00:24:37,93
That was full of brick

343
00:24:37,93 --> 00:24:42,18
and concrete buildings to find this what
the vice-chancellor call the federal house

344
00:24:44,17 --> 00:24:45,52
set in this derelict bit of ground

345
00:24:45,52 --> 00:24:48,66
that actually started to turn
into these wonderful gardens

346
00:24:48,66 --> 00:24:54,35
and we had four fairs which were
free and people used to come in

347
00:24:54,35 --> 00:24:58,46
and display what they you know anything
that was alternative was a was fair game.

348
00:25:00,37 --> 00:25:02,76
And that's where bill mollison started.

349
00:25:02,85 --> 00:25:06,05
I mean he came to the other first venues

350
00:25:06,05 --> 00:25:10,98
that he got involved in the lots
of aboriginal groups and g-d.

351
00:25:11,19 --> 00:25:14,82
Tony eady put up an enormous
g-d extraction that.

352
00:25:16,28 --> 00:25:19,92
We're course we experimented with
recycling systems and solar energy

353
00:25:19,92 --> 00:25:23,95
and villages and a lot of
gardeners got involved

354
00:25:23,95 --> 00:25:26,09
and universe if you south wales come over

355
00:25:26,09 --> 00:25:27,84
and built a mud brick
oven brian would would.

356
00:25:28,14 --> 00:25:33,60
I mean it was that it was a became
a focal point for a lot of.

357
00:25:33,61 --> 00:25:35,79
Mclay sheen had a solar cooker and

358
00:25:35,79 --> 00:25:40,29
that lots of i mean it became
a place where people could.

359
00:25:41,24 --> 00:25:43,44
You know show their ideas to other people

360
00:25:43,44 --> 00:25:47,72
and before fairs were
really very very successful

361
00:25:47,72 --> 00:25:50,26
when we ran out of gas after fortunate.

362
00:25:50,84 --> 00:25:56,18
There was nothing more we could say i
suppose but also we got a bit worried

363
00:25:56,18 --> 00:25:59,88
when the people who are involved
in setting up the house that. He.

364
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:02,62
We were setting up an absolute.

365
00:26:03,15 --> 00:26:06,07
Autonomous system within
the middle of a huge city

366
00:26:07,06 --> 00:26:08,24
that had all these systems in place

367
00:26:09,67 --> 00:26:13,43
and we thought it was a bit bit of an
anachronism actually do a good tour

368
00:26:14,83 --> 00:26:20,09
and what we came to conclusion that it
wasn't the systems wasn't the location

369
00:26:21,07 --> 00:26:24,41
and it wasn't going to nimbin or the
hawkesbury river or castle cragg

370
00:26:24,41 --> 00:26:24,89
or anything else.

371
00:26:25,19 --> 00:26:29,51
What was fundamental to what we're on
about was actually a change of attitude

372
00:26:30,31 --> 00:26:37,03
and a change of personal lifestyle
and a commitment to. You know.

373
00:26:37,05 --> 00:26:41,09
Being aware globally and acting locally.
You know that slogan was around the time.

374
00:26:41,36 --> 00:26:45,68
And it didn't matter whether i mean
we didn't think it was mattered

375
00:26:45,68 --> 00:26:47,24
that we weren't living it
nimbin or anywhere else.

376
00:26:47,50 --> 00:26:50,81
The fact was that we were
challenging the system

377
00:26:50,81 --> 00:26:53,34
and we were being personally
responsible for what we did.

378
00:26:53,47 --> 00:26:56,89
And we're altering our lifestyle that
we've been conscious about not wasting

379
00:26:56,89 --> 00:26:59,05
and we were conscious about
not trying things out.

380
00:27:00,58 --> 00:27:06,46
And we were committed to working on
systems and ways of building that.

381
00:27:06,47 --> 00:27:15,19
You know what you've
now cause sustainable.

382
00:27:19,43 --> 00:27:21,00
So i used to get a bit pissed off

383
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:27,07
that the ideas were.

384
00:27:27,80 --> 00:27:28,99
When our ideas

385
00:27:28,99 --> 00:27:31,75
or what we thought we're how it is
i mean probably weren't our ideas

386
00:27:31,75 --> 00:27:33,18
but anyway we own them.

387
00:27:33,38 --> 00:27:38,62
We got a bit disturbed the way mainstream
culture sometimes adapted them.

388
00:27:38,79 --> 00:27:43,76
I mean a classic point was we've done a lot
of work on solar water collectors with

389
00:27:43,76 --> 00:27:50,38
a guy called michael ling who had a
fascinating idea about parabolic reflectors

390
00:27:51,33 --> 00:27:56,29
and we set up you know. A cheap
recycled version of that.

391
00:27:56,44 --> 00:27:59,67
And then along comes a solar heart.

392
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,63
And they they produce a system which
we fought thought was really inferior.

393
00:28:04,79 --> 00:28:08,96
I mean it was using materials that
weren't that weren't energy efficient.

394
00:28:09,97 --> 00:28:13,16
Whereas they've been firms like beazley for
example south australia had been doing

395
00:28:13,16 --> 00:28:15,40
so i water systems for years.

396
00:28:15,44 --> 00:28:18,69
I mean they've been up in the 1930s
for you know had never caught on.

397
00:28:19,84 --> 00:28:20,91
But solar heart went ahead.

398
00:28:21,36 --> 00:28:25,07
Like gangbusters and they
produced these heavy systems

399
00:28:25,07 --> 00:28:29,70
that sat on rooms where they and
they worked and. The public.

400
00:28:30,33 --> 00:28:32,47
Bought them and they feel good about them.

401
00:28:32,63 --> 00:28:36,34
I mean i don't think they alter
their lifestyle one inch though

402
00:28:36,35 --> 00:28:39,52
and they still continue to use
more water than they had to.

403
00:28:41,11 --> 00:28:44,38
And they still had an
electric backup system.

404
00:28:45,15 --> 00:28:51,61
So you know i did feel a bit upset about
that but i don't now i just think

405
00:28:51,61 --> 00:28:52,94
that.

406
00:28:53,81 --> 00:28:56,23
Those ideas of most of the ideas

407
00:28:56,23 --> 00:29:00,77
that were being experimented with have
been adopted by mainstream culture and.

408
00:29:01,42 --> 00:29:02,60
And that's good. I mean.

409
00:29:03,12 --> 00:29:07,40
I don't think lifestyle has been altered
materially it's still a very consumers

410
00:29:07,40 --> 00:29:11,72
society but that may
change or is changing.

411
00:29:13,31 --> 00:29:18,67
I mean there were a lot of the green movements
now which probably had their origins

412
00:29:18,67 --> 00:29:24,39
then. And it was almost a
religion became a religion.

413
00:29:24,73 --> 00:29:26,24
I mean.

414
00:29:26,25 --> 00:29:29,22
Those values of permeating at every level

415
00:29:29,22 --> 00:29:35,85
and i think the federal government

416
00:29:35,85 --> 00:29:40,92
and other people in places like the water
board and planning authorities and.

417
00:29:42,47 --> 00:29:46,86
In in local government and in a
very conscious of these values now.

418
00:29:47,22 --> 00:29:52,60
When it was unheard of for example.

419
00:29:52,61 --> 00:29:56,96
10 years ago to actually
have citizens recycling the.

420
00:29:57,26 --> 00:29:59,87
Their their products of
their waste products.

421
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:00,63
At a local government level

422
00:30:01,79 --> 00:30:05,69
and i remember going out of the
city council arguing black and blue

423
00:30:05,69 --> 00:30:09,11
that they should start a paper recycling
program and they just said are you mad.

424
00:30:09,17 --> 00:30:14,24
You know. You know just doesn't work it's
not economic. It's cost but over time.

425
00:30:16,90 --> 00:30:18,60
It's become absolutely essential.

426
00:30:19,19 --> 00:30:21,68
No council would dare not recycle

427
00:30:21,68 --> 00:30:24,24
when you zealanders got into
it long before australians.

428
00:30:24,85 --> 00:30:28,39
When they had some wonderful
recycling programs.

429
00:30:30,10 --> 00:30:33,07
But i mean there are things
like that that i'm very pleased

430
00:30:33,07 --> 00:30:36,67
that they've become mainstream.

431
00:30:37,53 --> 00:30:41,38
I mean i suppose in some ways.

432
00:30:41,40 --> 00:30:45,21
This rampant sort of
consumerism is going to.

433
00:30:45,23 --> 00:30:49,75
Mean people are now aware much more they
ever were about the finite resources of

434
00:30:49,75 --> 00:30:53,99
the planet and are being a lot more
more careful about what they do.

435
00:30:54,93 --> 00:30:59,90
We're still hooked on a lot of
things like our transport systems.

436
00:31:00,60 --> 00:31:03,25
But there i mean there are people
like better cities program

437
00:31:03,25 --> 00:31:08,35
that are conscientious lee trying to get
people out of their cars they try to

438
00:31:08,35 --> 00:31:14,37
locate workplaces close to living places
or to integrate them. There are people.

439
00:31:15,08 --> 00:31:21,94
Pushing light rail their
people pushing better water

440
00:31:21,94 --> 00:31:25,37
systems or recycling water's
stormwater and cleaning it

441
00:31:25,37 --> 00:31:29,44
and recycling the housing
department believe it

442
00:31:29,44 --> 00:31:34,49
or not is now putting in twin water systems
in their houses on the outer suburbs.

443
00:31:35,72 --> 00:31:38,28
Because i mean every site
live got two systems of water

444
00:31:38,28 --> 00:31:41,36
and they're ever conscious that
they're polluting the hawks.

445
00:31:45,11 --> 00:31:47,91
So i mean i am very happy about all that.

446
00:31:49,10 --> 00:31:50,38
It's maybe not moving fast enough

447
00:31:50,38 --> 00:31:55,33
and maybe not being conclusive enough by
big disappointment is i guess lifestyle

448
00:31:55,33 --> 00:31:59,86
and i still think that's i've come to believe
that's the issue. And unless you can.

449
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:04,64
Right through to people that are
very at their household level.

450
00:32:05,43 --> 00:32:09,72
Which is one reason why for example at
the moment i'm interested in a recycling

451
00:32:09,72 --> 00:32:15,07
sewage system that actually started the
household starts and finishes the house

452
00:32:15,07 --> 00:32:19,25
and when i think basically people are
more responsible than bureaucracies

453
00:32:20,47 --> 00:32:26,69
and people are very seemed to me to be
very willing to allow bureau bureaucracies

454
00:32:26,69 --> 00:32:29,44
to do the dirty work and
then criticize them for it

455
00:32:29,44 --> 00:32:34,29
but if it was sheeted home at a household
level about that's where it really

456
00:32:34,29 --> 00:32:39,17
matters then. Just as. Just as.

457
00:32:39,96 --> 00:32:44,79
The community have been capable
of handling the recycling. Idea.

458
00:32:44,88 --> 00:32:47,73
I think they could take on
just take it one step further

459
00:32:47,73 --> 00:32:52,77
and now start looking at their water
supply their stormwater their grey water

460
00:32:52,77 --> 00:32:55,15
and their sewage.

461
00:32:56,57 --> 00:33:01,11
There's another thing i want to add which
i perhaps should have said some time ago

462
00:33:01,11 --> 00:33:05,67
but that is after the festival was over.

463
00:33:05,68 --> 00:33:06,52
Johnny allen

464
00:33:06,52 --> 00:33:11,01
and i went to see the department
decentralisation because we thought you know.

465
00:33:11,03 --> 00:33:11,91
We've done it

466
00:33:11,91 --> 00:33:16,96
and they haven't you know here's these
thousands of people living up there and.

467
00:33:18,28 --> 00:33:19,33
And so we went to see them

468
00:33:19,33 --> 00:33:24,01
and said look you know we think we've
got a better formula than you have.

469
00:33:24,03 --> 00:33:25,69
And it's all about lost time.

470
00:33:27,51 --> 00:33:30,70
And they they sort of they said they
were interested because they'd heard

471
00:33:30,70 --> 00:33:31,92
and seen the phenomenon.

472
00:33:33,64 --> 00:33:35,24
But they weren't at all
impressed with the people

473
00:33:35,24 --> 00:33:39,44
or you know they just thought you know
how we're not going to flood the country

474
00:33:39,44 --> 00:33:45,81
with hippies. Even though i mean.

475
00:33:45,83 --> 00:33:46,88
Lots of the

476
00:33:46,88 --> 00:33:50,74
but the kids at neiman i mean one of the
best experiences i had there was this.

477
00:33:51,32 --> 00:33:54,23
This family have said you
know my kids came back.

478
00:33:54,36 --> 00:33:59,95
You know with that festival and i thought
that was that was good. For the.

479
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:02,20
Family that was really quite a success

480
00:34:02,20 --> 00:34:05,54
that in fact their kids had returned
because they they came back with.

481
00:34:06,53 --> 00:34:08,32
Attitudes that their parents
probably didn't like

482
00:34:08,32 --> 00:34:12,22
but nevertheless they were back and
they were going to do organic farming

483
00:34:12,22 --> 00:34:15,06
and they were going to tell their old
man to get rid of the pesticides

484
00:34:15,06 --> 00:34:19,65
and the fertilizer and to wake up and
but that was the that was the challenge

485
00:34:19,65 --> 00:34:24,79
and they came back on their own terms
not on their own their parents terms.

486
00:34:24,81 --> 00:34:29,91
But this it was asian didn't give us a
lot of money to go and do it again so.

487
00:34:30,63 --> 00:34:33,93
But it happened anyway when people
started settling in bieber valley

488
00:34:33,93 --> 00:34:37,78
and in new england area and.

489
00:34:37,79 --> 00:34:41,12
When i was party to setting up a
huge community coffs harbour.

490
00:34:41,77 --> 00:34:43,67
We had 200 shareholders and.

491
00:34:44,25 --> 00:34:48,75
We bought a wonderful piece of land
on the waterfront of some badger.

492
00:34:49,38 --> 00:34:54,43
And i'm still a member of
that but i i don't go there.

493
00:34:54,45 --> 00:34:55,38
Person that set

494
00:34:55,38 --> 00:34:59,22
that up was an insurance salesman actually
i just i can never i i think he actually

495
00:35:00,49 --> 00:35:05,21
i mean he was committed to the ideology
and lifestyle but underneath it all.

496
00:35:05,46 --> 00:35:09,54
He was actually selling an insurance
policy and people bought it and

497
00:35:09,54 --> 00:35:13,05
when they said you know here's the
lifeboats. You know if things get crook.

498
00:35:13,70 --> 00:35:20,28
We'll go. We'll go north.

499
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:38,22
Well i was delighted. I mean i was a
lot of the people stayed and i was.

500
00:35:39,95 --> 00:35:42,52
I've been back to nimbin a couple
of times since the festival.

501
00:35:43,86 --> 00:35:48,15
Three times four times i
think and i'm very proud

502
00:35:48,15 --> 00:35:53,46
that i was part of the the idea to breathe
some life in an embed i mean i very

503
00:35:53,46 --> 00:35:56,37
proud. I mean i think
it. I think it worked.

504
00:35:58,01 --> 00:35:59,83
It went through a lot of
teething problems of.

505
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:01,00
It's a lot of conflict

506
00:36:02,08 --> 00:36:07,73
and it was very painful for a lot of
people to confront that sort of lifestyle

507
00:36:07,73 --> 00:36:13,76
and to have their lives disrupted
in that way but in the end.

508
00:36:15,84 --> 00:36:20,57
I think that both the people who settled
there and the people who live there.

509
00:36:20,71 --> 00:36:25,73
Well people who went there 20 years ago
have now become the establishment.

510
00:36:26,52 --> 00:36:27,92
I mean the last time was up hours.

511
00:36:27,99 --> 00:36:29,20
I was a bit disturbed

512
00:36:29,20 --> 00:36:34,34
that the people who are speaking
to go there now the minority

513
00:36:34,34 --> 00:36:37,88
and they were called the droogs of the old
established hippies were becoming the

514
00:36:37,88 --> 00:36:42,99
sort of like the establishment
when. It's like recycling.

515
00:36:44,17 --> 00:36:47,05
But a lot of them have still got
their are their ideals and.

516
00:36:47,74 --> 00:36:52,10
I got involved in a you know what's called
a development control plan with some of

517
00:36:52,10 --> 00:36:52,32
the residents

518
00:36:52,32 --> 00:36:56,42
and we did run some workshops about what
direction the town wanted to go in and.

519
00:36:56,86 --> 00:37:03,34
Lismore council amazingly were
prepared to pass over a lot of the

520
00:37:03,34 --> 00:37:11,25
responsibility for preparing master plans
over to you know a community committee.

521
00:37:11,26 --> 00:37:12,64
Of very responsible.

522
00:37:12,70 --> 00:37:16,29
You know active people and they did it

523
00:37:16,29 --> 00:37:19,17
and i was just a facilitator
from outside it came in

524
00:37:20,96 --> 00:37:23,87
and sort of you know helped
if a technical point of view

525
00:37:23,87 --> 00:37:26,92
but i was also pleased about that.

526
00:37:27,09 --> 00:37:29,09
I mean he was citizens getting up

527
00:37:29,09 --> 00:37:33,28
and taking control of the
town the way it ought to be.

528
00:37:33,30 --> 00:37:38,26
Instead of continually relying on the
council to do things or i mean it's

529
00:37:38,26 --> 00:37:41,03
that thing of acting locally and

530
00:37:42,00 --> 00:37:46,62
and not not passing responsibility down
the line and then getting upset about it.

531
00:37:50,25 --> 00:37:59,87
Just.

532
00:38:06,88 --> 00:38:12,67
I'm i say in my day to day operations in
i'm very i'm committed to housing i mean

533
00:38:12,67 --> 00:38:14,50
i'm more and more involved in.

534
00:38:14,68 --> 00:38:18,02
In community based housing and
with and in aboriginal work.

535
00:38:18,51 --> 00:38:20,72
I've been working for 20 years
with a housing company.

536
00:38:21,33 --> 00:38:24,08
And i continually run into
people in the bureaucracy

537
00:38:24,08 --> 00:38:30,76
or in in powerful positions in
government who i used to know

538
00:38:31,97 --> 00:38:33,50
20 years ago less

539
00:38:34,52 --> 00:38:38,56
but who i knew you know had been attracted
to the same sort of things i have been

540
00:38:38,56 --> 00:38:42,49
attracted to and. In some ways
they still had constraints

541
00:38:42,49 --> 00:38:45,76
but a lot of them still had
a lot of that ideology

542
00:38:45,76 --> 00:38:52,20
and the best thing about it was that
you could talk. I could talk to them.

543
00:38:52,22 --> 00:38:55,05
From a point of view that where
we both knew who had come from.

544
00:38:56,63 --> 00:39:01,70
And one could appeal to some of
their earlier instincts and.

545
00:39:02,43 --> 00:39:05,94
And sometimes get to a position where we
couldn't have got two had we not known

546
00:39:05,94 --> 00:39:08,44
each other or had i not known
that they'd been there

547
00:39:09,44 --> 00:39:14,83
and put a bureaucratic facade and
there are a lot of people like that.

548
00:39:15,84 --> 00:39:19,57
With a lot of goodwill in government in the
public service who are actually trying

549
00:39:19,57 --> 00:39:24,06
to. Still do things that
are important to people

550
00:39:24,06 --> 00:39:28,08
and still reflect empowering
local people and.

551
00:39:28,10 --> 00:39:32,42
In gendering some idea of cooperation.

552
00:39:32,44 --> 00:39:37,87
The article i read in this morning's paper
are still saying communes in co-ops were

553
00:39:37,87 --> 00:39:41,89
one of the sort of
hallmarks that might be so

554
00:39:41,89 --> 00:39:46,58
but i mean co-op is you've been around in
the in the dairy company for four years i

555
00:39:46,58 --> 00:39:50,72
mean they were birthed in about the 1920s
in effect the cult movement got its got

556
00:39:50,72 --> 00:39:54,45
its start in the very dairy
industry in the north coast

557
00:39:55,62 --> 00:39:59,39
and it's not it's not a big shift to switch
to housing cooperatives is not a happy

558
00:39:59,39 --> 00:40:01,47
thing. At all. It makes a lot of sense

559
00:40:02,58 --> 00:40:07,01
and i'm particularly committed to housing
co-op is a there's a bridge between

560
00:40:07,01 --> 00:40:10,02
rental and home ownership and.

561
00:40:10,65 --> 00:40:15,44
In working with aboriginal communities
i mean they were they were exploring

562
00:40:15,45 --> 00:40:20,17
and developing community. Communes
and community lifestyles and.

563
00:40:20,85 --> 00:40:22,81
Tribal lifestyles you know so

564
00:40:24,27 --> 00:40:28,22
that hundreds of thousands of years probably
where that's where the co-operative

565
00:40:28,22 --> 00:40:32,44
movement in the probably got its
origins out of tribal cultures

566
00:40:34,61 --> 00:40:37,70
and it's interesting that the
aboriginal communities around.

567
00:40:37,72 --> 00:40:41,96
Lismore actually were a vital part
of the aquarius festival as well

568
00:40:41,96 --> 00:40:45,85
when they they were there in
numbers and they participated and.

569
00:40:45,87 --> 00:40:47,39
That was quite a strong
part of the festival

570
00:40:48,73 --> 00:40:54,15
and the housing property movement is
probably in aboriginal circles is one of the

571
00:40:54,15 --> 00:40:55,42
strongest movements in the.

572
00:40:55,80 --> 00:41:01,83
In the state of hundreds of housing
co-ops in new south wales and queensland.

573
00:41:02,67 --> 00:41:04,89
And they continue to.

574
00:41:06,67 --> 00:41:13,57
To develop on cooperative principles.

575
00:41:19,18 --> 00:41:25,61
Yeah i don't know the land rights issue was
canvassed at the at the festival issues

576
00:41:25,61 --> 00:41:31,52
of commute ality and lifestyle and
like some of the aboriginal people

577
00:41:31,52 --> 00:41:32,59
that came to that festival.

578
00:41:33,06 --> 00:41:39,62
Talked about the students
as white aboriginals

579
00:41:39,62 --> 00:41:45,75
like they they their
perception was that a lot of.

580
00:41:45,77 --> 00:41:49,55
The alternative culture was in fact
experimenting with an aboriginal lifestyle.

581
00:41:49,82 --> 00:41:55,06
Like having a little impact on the
land eating more natural materials

582
00:41:55,06 --> 00:41:59,80
and acting and entertaining.

583
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:02,67
Skills in a very aboriginal sort
of way like dancing and singing

584
00:42:02,67 --> 00:42:05,25
and campfire sort of culture was.

585
00:42:07,58 --> 00:42:14,10
Was very evident and
people like harry penrith.

586
00:42:15,72 --> 00:42:20,96
And mike she got there lots of people
who either aboriginal people are well

587
00:42:20,96 --> 00:42:25,47
connected in a bundle and mob.

588
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:29,56
Gary and williams.

589
00:42:29,81 --> 00:42:31,74
I mean it all had gotten involved

590
00:42:32,99 --> 00:42:36,86
and who had a powerful influence i
think in a lot of the thinking.

591
00:42:37,17 --> 00:42:40,28
Burn and burn it. That's how it
was used to call her parents.

592
00:42:40,40 --> 00:42:41,01
I mean he was

593
00:42:41,95 --> 00:42:45,43
and has been continuously involved in an
alternative lifestyle sort of movement

594
00:42:45,43 --> 00:42:55,76
and in trying to connect white australians
with a sort of a tribal culture.
