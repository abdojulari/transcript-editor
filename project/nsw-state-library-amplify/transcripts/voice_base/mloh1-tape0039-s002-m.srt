1
00:00:06,33 --> 00:00:11,67
We are started when the team harron out.
To talk about alf much at the formula. And

2
00:00:11,67 --> 00:00:14,82
yes i can remember him coming
years to come out quite

3
00:00:14,82 --> 00:00:21,14
a lot because he had it different consignments
that he probably wanted to do. Prior

4
00:00:21,14 --> 00:00:25,19
to others you know with the numbering they
knew what they were looking for. So he

5
00:00:25,19 --> 00:00:26,20
used to have to come out quite

6
00:00:26,20 --> 00:00:33,06
a lot. He was about my build about
five foot nine ten and didn't look

7
00:00:33,06 --> 00:00:36,51
to have any fight on him or anything
else like that fairish hair and

8
00:00:36,51 --> 00:00:40,56
a bit of colour in the cheeks
which was quite common for quite

9
00:00:40,56 --> 00:00:45,78
a lot from england. No face
and. Pretty quiet sort of

10
00:00:45,78 --> 00:00:51,59
a fellow military you know he did the job
very well. Several people inside reckon

11
00:00:51,59 --> 00:00:57,18
that he was he was very careful when he
gave instructions. As far as making sure

12
00:00:57,18 --> 00:01:01,94
that people got the right message. Yeah
well he was there and that's what i was

13
00:01:01,94 --> 00:01:02,29
going to say

14
00:01:02,29 --> 00:01:09,62
a while ago about the the accuracy
with which they had to do i

15
00:01:09,62 --> 00:01:14,26
had to take some to make the temperance
i think out of redwood and they had

16
00:01:14,26 --> 00:01:16,74
a big assembly area where
they used to assemble

17
00:01:16,74 --> 00:01:23,41
a whole member up above and we used to have
to sling the stuff down there and send

18
00:01:23,41 --> 00:01:27,63
it up and i got up there once and i was off
siding we were slack outside there and

19
00:01:27,63 --> 00:01:34,38
i was i siding with this little template
mark. I think may have been his title. And

20
00:01:34,39 --> 00:01:39,90
i had the steel type.
Major in and he said that

21
00:01:41,28 --> 00:01:47,77
near enough is not good enough if
the type bisected certain area is

22
00:01:48,52 --> 00:01:53,29
not good enough he said near in this
business near enough is not good enough. And

23
00:01:53,29 --> 00:01:55,85
when you realize just
how important that is

24
00:01:56,85 --> 00:01:59,80
a small little deviation on the width of

25
00:01:59,80 --> 00:02:05,87
a mark. I will finish up first out by the
time i get to the other end of the plate

26
00:02:05,87 --> 00:02:09,94
you know and that impressed me very much.
When i felt that you know i was very

27
00:02:09,94 --> 00:02:12,30
careful. I was while holding

28
00:02:12,30 --> 00:02:17,11
a tape for now i'm words do you ever
remember them putting the tapes out in the

29
00:02:17,11 --> 00:02:22,62
harbor to get the temperature down. You
know going to remember that that happened.

30
00:02:22,65 --> 00:02:27,49
Yes apparently it did happen. Over
apparently when the when the temperature got

31
00:02:27,49 --> 00:02:32,78
very hot the tapes would stretch too
far and they put them up against

32
00:02:32,78 --> 00:02:37,58
a standard which was apparently wood which
we didn't expand so much. And if it was

33
00:02:37,58 --> 00:02:40,24
measured somewhere i don't know what it
was on the wharf or what it was inside

34
00:02:40,24 --> 00:02:41,14
a where there was

35
00:02:41,14 --> 00:02:45,09
a permanent measure there. And they and
they used to compare them periodically on

36
00:02:45,09 --> 00:02:50,49
a hot day particularly and the stories.
Anyway i don't know how accurate they are

37
00:02:51,19 --> 00:02:53,88
of them giving the but the tapes

38
00:02:53,88 --> 00:02:59,24
a swim as they call to
get the girl down is

39
00:02:59,24 --> 00:03:05,11
a beaut as i say then it would be necessary
after you know what this little fella

40
00:03:05,11 --> 00:03:08,96
told me you know in the bandy legged
fellow i can't remember his name. I wasn't

41
00:03:08,96 --> 00:03:15,56
with him that long journey of the
other doormen long people. Well.

42
00:03:17,56 --> 00:03:24,45
No no not particularly those of the ones
that i was more immediately concerned

43
00:03:24,45 --> 00:03:30,54
with you know that i did mention. Did you
see it. Well at all. He was in charge of

44
00:03:30,54 --> 00:03:36,48
verse dealer action. And i don't want
him. No one's come to mind but i

45
00:03:37,71 --> 00:03:39,39
was on the construction

46
00:03:39,39 --> 00:03:44,58
a fellow name you or he was on it mostly
on this side. I think in my i had

47
00:03:44,58 --> 00:03:47,81
a counterpart on the southern
side i don't know but he was

48
00:03:47,81 --> 00:03:53,20
a stocky but i get their press that he was
an american but i'm not sure he may have

49
00:03:53,20 --> 00:03:53,65
been be was

50
00:03:53,65 --> 00:03:58,95
a scot. I think. But you know it whether
he worked in america. I don't know and i

51
00:03:58,95 --> 00:04:00,06
think this was it was

52
00:04:00,06 --> 00:04:06,25
a scot but he'd worked in america. Yeah you
know well he came down to the wharf on

53
00:04:06,25 --> 00:04:11,53
occasions and because the right time that
we unloaded all those cables. It was

54
00:04:11,53 --> 00:04:18,21
probably the best job after going to work
an all nighter and union rules where the

55
00:04:18,21 --> 00:04:23,35
two of his had to accompany us so that
meant that there were four men for diamond

56
00:04:23,35 --> 00:04:27,48
beach lad came out with one of those
coils particularly if they had

57
00:04:27,48 --> 00:04:32,94
a big drag from under the combs in the
hatches it take about twenty minutes because

58
00:04:32,94 --> 00:04:37,98
the queen had to go in hell. I love gear
and as they came out we guided them down

59
00:04:37,98 --> 00:04:40,61
to where they had to be
stacked each of us grabbed

60
00:04:40,61 --> 00:04:45,18
a hook to let go and went back by the fire
for the rest aright. So we've got pretty

61
00:04:45,18 --> 00:04:51,11
good money and i was pretty good. I got
the biggest pay i think i ever got down

62
00:04:51,11 --> 00:04:55,91
there was fourteen pound and i don't know
how many ships were tied up and let go

63
00:04:55,91 --> 00:05:02,33
and how many all nighters. We did now. Do
you ever hear anything or see anything of

64
00:05:02,33 --> 00:05:07,79
them dumping steel in the harbor
overnight. No i didn't i did. Again i got

65
00:05:07,79 --> 00:05:13,43
a story you know of them dumping badly
drilled plates. You know didn't hear or see

66
00:05:13,43 --> 00:05:17,03
anything of that. The only thing as
far as i was concerned i used to have

67
00:05:17,03 --> 00:05:23,86
a big hopper with. Rings
on each corner and

68
00:05:23,87 --> 00:05:29,40
i cry and used to pick up the shavings
they'd use and swing them out and dump them

69
00:05:29,40 --> 00:05:29,55
on

70
00:05:29,55 --> 00:05:36,59
a barge or punt and i
know that there was great

71
00:05:36,59 --> 00:05:42,94
stress laid on not spilling but it
fails dumping i didn't say you know.

72
00:05:43,50 --> 00:05:49,55
I probably went back to newcastle. I don't
know where i went really but. You know

73
00:05:49,55 --> 00:05:49,67
it was

74
00:05:49,67 --> 00:05:54,01
a lot of them as you can imagine from all
those drills. I can remember there was

75
00:05:54,01 --> 00:06:00,50
a scot for all and i care he had two sons
the both worked and i was one of the

76
00:06:00,50 --> 00:06:01,22
first suggest

77
00:06:01,22 --> 00:06:05,60
a whale the timing's out in the world about
what was this do you member the sons

78
00:06:05,60 --> 00:06:09,19
names. You know but i go. Well
as an alfred kerr who was

79
00:06:09,19 --> 00:06:15,06
a driller yeah well no i'm. Yeah well
i could have been one of them. I was

80
00:06:16,26 --> 00:06:21,90
back scott. You know all very black hair
and everything else like that but dark

81
00:06:21,90 --> 00:06:25,57
complexioned i tell me the different parts
of scotland where they are like that.

82
00:06:26,55 --> 00:06:32,43
And another family. There was smith. With

83
00:06:32,43 --> 00:06:35,67
a little fat fell on them and start

84
00:06:35,67 --> 00:06:40,89
w out here. He had two sons and
one of them was now a mass. I'm

85
00:06:40,89 --> 00:06:44,27
a double team and i can't remember the
other one. But one of them played football

86
00:06:44,27 --> 00:06:46,53
with us. If i think it

87
00:06:46,53 --> 00:06:52,44
a way that was the reason james beer
came over to your end was that he was in

88
00:06:52,44 --> 00:06:57,86
charge of substructure and for the whole
bridge job you see he was his were he was

89
00:06:57,86 --> 00:07:02,69
a concrete and stone man he was in charge
of the quarry as well. Yeah you know and

90
00:07:03,66 --> 00:07:09,46
but he and hit well who was still in
charge of steeler action. They had an

91
00:07:09,46 --> 00:07:14,05
arrangement and went before the arch joined
that one would be in charge of one side

92
00:07:14,05 --> 00:07:17,67
for the whole lot and the other one would
be in charge of the other you'll see. But

93
00:07:17,67 --> 00:07:22,48
when they joined then after that then he
would revert to being in charge of all the

94
00:07:22,48 --> 00:07:28,79
substructure. Yes i remember the name
hopeful when you mentioned it but i'm no.

95
00:07:28,81 --> 00:07:35,73
Association really that i could
point to with him. And now

96
00:07:35,73 --> 00:07:39,70
i wonder i wanted to ask you in your travels
and interviews or anything else like

97
00:07:39,70 --> 00:07:45,63
that. Have you ever heard the name of siddle
oh i've heard it mentioned but not not

98
00:07:45,64 --> 00:07:51,22
much no lie. Visited earlier to you by
the way is name identity still alive

99
00:07:51,22 --> 00:07:58,17
actually but his name is on one of the
lists and i look it up for you. Said no

100
00:07:58,17 --> 00:07:59,12
one made see was

101
00:07:59,12 --> 00:08:03,45
a fellow to tell me i talked to selling
to be over twenty one you know and

102
00:08:03,46 --> 00:08:03,89
a hell of

103
00:08:03,89 --> 00:08:10,45
a good athlete and i bumped him during the
war. We're both in the table and he was

104
00:08:10,45 --> 00:08:16,48
a captain then said was pretty bright and
he started out there with us. But he was

105
00:08:16,48 --> 00:08:18,96
finished up with as italic like and he did

106
00:08:18,96 --> 00:08:23,08
a lot of work in the office that was in
between the two buildings. That's was

107
00:08:23,08 --> 00:08:30,04
a main office and drawing office doing it.
Yes that's why i said finished up. You

108
00:08:30,04 --> 00:08:31,88
know i just wondered you know is a bit of

109
00:08:31,88 --> 00:08:37,32
a scallywag too that i won't go into that
you might save me. If he's around but he

110
00:08:37,32 --> 00:08:40,21
was a very good tweak
alone and you know and

111
00:08:40,22 --> 00:08:44,94
a good mate to me. Well i'll the feeling
you feel i have just look at me. Book just

112
00:08:44,94 --> 00:08:45,35
hold on

113
00:08:45,35 --> 00:08:51,98
a minute. I let looks as if the low we
have on the list is not him it's somebody

114
00:08:51,98 --> 00:08:57,70
else's search was george low so it must
be him. Can you remember anyone else down

115
00:08:57,70 --> 00:09:03,88
there. Well i think i've gone through most
of the names i did write some down and

116
00:09:06,07 --> 00:09:12,26
i was going to tell you about that. That
jordy fellow but i thought of that. We

117
00:09:12,26 --> 00:09:18,91
were on the wharf. But idle at the moment
and right across towards mcmahon's point

118
00:09:18,91 --> 00:09:23,14
there were two fellows on the boat rowing
boat that looked like and they were

119
00:09:23,14 --> 00:09:26,74
pulling in pulling in pulling in and i had

120
00:09:26,74 --> 00:09:30,80
a pile right on the back so that the bear
was sticking up in the air and i said i.

121
00:09:30,80 --> 00:09:36,35
Geordi what do you reckon they're doing.
He says they're pull it out can't just

122
00:09:36,35 --> 00:09:42,53
keep water going down. I don't. That
was priceless you know as quick as

123
00:09:42,53 --> 00:09:45,92
a flash is when it was supposed phenomenal
no i didn't even know what i was going

124
00:09:45,92 --> 00:09:50,90
to say. And that was the little geordi
that felt i described earlier being jockey

125
00:09:50,90 --> 00:09:57,06
size you know and that i just had to tell
you that because i told it 100 times you

126
00:09:57,06 --> 00:10:00,67
know in my lifetime and there
was big bill brown he was

127
00:10:00,67 --> 00:10:07,52
a geordi he worked out there is in that
photo that i gave john andrew and his

128
00:10:07,52 --> 00:10:09,04
son came down to visiting one day

129
00:10:09,04 --> 00:10:15,30
a big six foot strapping bloke and we
mentioned about it and both as i. He said

130
00:10:15,30 --> 00:10:21,93
that he cried for the first six months and
he said use that used to sleep with us.

131
00:10:22,07 --> 00:10:25,36
We are as you know in at all but
there will be had. I try and talk

132
00:10:25,36 --> 00:10:31,78
a bit like him and he said. One night

133
00:10:33,17 --> 00:10:39,08
we in used to get sleepy sense and one night
he fell out of bed and he said we had

134
00:10:39,08 --> 00:10:43,60
a good sleep. It's if you book it if i don't
know no other pushed him out long ago

135
00:10:45,19 --> 00:10:47,60
. So that was billy brown just

136
00:10:47,60 --> 00:10:51,59
a couple i think that i think that they
do you know how many of them were brought

137
00:10:51,59 --> 00:10:54,98
out by doing one long or.
You know there was quite

138
00:10:54,98 --> 00:10:58,85
a lot of georgism middlesbrough fellows
there i do you know how many were brought

139
00:10:58,85 --> 00:11:03,36
out and how many just sort of came you
know i don't know. Numbers. I didn't get

140
00:11:03,36 --> 00:11:09,16
that you know information in in my experience
there. But i understood and because i

141
00:11:09,16 --> 00:11:14,66
was pretty young and silly according to
said i understood that most of them were

142
00:11:14,66 --> 00:11:21,52
brought out you know most of the palms
and we called them time and that they

143
00:11:21,52 --> 00:11:26,03
were from door milan gorman long's employment
they were there and we thought that

144
00:11:26,03 --> 00:11:32,15
they were sent out and specialists. Yes
well the key ones were i know that i was

145
00:11:32,15 --> 00:11:33,73
about twenty but that's including mr.

146
00:11:33,73 --> 00:11:38,92
Innis i don't think there was any more
than that. Did you ever come across any of

147
00:11:38,92 --> 00:11:42,05
any of the people that worked on the arch
i mean for instance if i went on that i

148
00:11:42,05 --> 00:11:44,10
mean it was jack harris
for instance he was

149
00:11:44,10 --> 00:11:50,40
a house taffy taffy they used to call him
you. He was a boss rigger i think yes

150
00:11:50,41 --> 00:11:51,76
a little fellow they reckon he was like

151
00:11:51,76 --> 00:11:55,72
a spy. They could climb all over the place
you know he used to be like to be known

152
00:11:55,72 --> 00:11:59,92
as the human fly. That's right. That would
be the same fellow and i think he was

153
00:11:59,92 --> 00:12:06,90
a welshman was you know i think
they nickname was taffy. Yes the

154
00:12:06,90 --> 00:12:11,23
little fellow as they were he was one of
the ones that were brought out so i was

155
00:12:11,23 --> 00:12:16,03
alf but it but i don't think there was
more than twenty that i can actually trace

156
00:12:16,03 --> 00:12:17,62
that. I made

157
00:12:17,62 --> 00:12:21,65
a lot of the others came out under under
regulation schemes and such like you know

158
00:12:21,65 --> 00:12:28,48
. You know. And some paid
their own way. I was

159
00:12:28,49 --> 00:12:33,64
part immigration and part something else
and someone got sponsored yeah yeah. A

160
00:12:33,64 --> 00:12:40,43
kiddie young kid came down there one day
with jock's lunch and he's at the gate and

161
00:12:40,43 --> 00:12:46,58
a fellow said jock who. And
if you said he didn't know

162
00:12:46,58 --> 00:12:49,93
a surname. So the fellow saying out how

163
00:12:49,93 --> 00:12:54,01
a shark and i went about twenty of
them stood up because there's quite

164
00:12:54,01 --> 00:12:58,11
a few scots there too but
that was just another side

165
00:12:59,20 --> 00:13:05,52
a cloud side belfast dualities yeah. Oh
yes but you meant getting put off and

166
00:13:05,52 --> 00:13:11,84
when that one. You don't remember the
actual time i remember the occasion because

167
00:13:13,07 --> 00:13:18,23
i've been warned. You know things were
pretty bad outside. And i'd also been warned

168
00:13:18,23 --> 00:13:23,98
that i'd be one of the first because i was
one of the last ones to be put in that

169
00:13:23,98 --> 00:13:26,47
particular section. And with the.

170
00:13:30,66 --> 00:13:37,58
Stopping of the steel coming out i was
there done that. So that's it. I know i

171
00:13:37,58 --> 00:13:44,19
mean they had to start looking put thing
else and it was pretty hard to define

172
00:13:44,19 --> 00:13:50,76
a thing or we got we on the dole. And
i when i went onto the dole. But.

173
00:13:51,39 --> 00:13:56,55
I remember what it was that oh well it
was only on the coupons in those days i

174
00:13:56,55 --> 00:14:02,89
can't remember the actual money but it
was very difficult to get the ingredient

175
00:14:02,89 --> 00:14:06,20
that you want because
the government put out

176
00:14:06,20 --> 00:14:13,03
a table and you motor the dealers would
give you what was on that table. I

177
00:14:13,03 --> 00:14:16,17
wouldn't deviate at all. We had
to have to go up to me and it is

178
00:14:16,17 --> 00:14:23,06
a hall at north sydney to pick it up and
when i moved that i used to walk from lane

179
00:14:23,06 --> 00:14:29,71
cove. I mean these are home and
then i got will leave work two in

180
00:14:29,71 --> 00:14:36,51
five i had to do two days or two
weeks two weeks in five weeks. I

181
00:14:36,51 --> 00:14:40,69
think it was three penta then
we have any sixteen shillings

182
00:14:41,44 --> 00:14:48,35
a day you were married then
used to till we got to we

183
00:14:48,35 --> 00:14:51,74
were living with my wife people quite

184
00:14:51,75 --> 00:14:58,21
a while and then at always turns
out we moved on into college and

185
00:14:59,38 --> 00:15:01,53
that's what we paid $16 sixteen shillings

186
00:15:01,53 --> 00:15:06,86
a week when we could pay and
what about when you couldn't.

187
00:15:08,42 --> 00:15:15,41
Well i think the firm's name was
hardy and gorman and mr jones

188
00:15:16,23 --> 00:15:22,68
was the agent the jester correct our
collective end because in between. I had

189
00:15:22,68 --> 00:15:28,88
a couple of other jobs. And i worked
in the gas company for a while as

190
00:15:28,89 --> 00:15:35,75
a labor and then i applied for
the buses and it took eighteen

191
00:15:35,75 --> 00:15:42,05
months to go through and when i was called
up eventually. There were fifty two of

192
00:15:42,05 --> 00:15:48,28
its went in the deal ever passed.

193
00:15:48,30 --> 00:15:49,83
So i got

194
00:15:49,83 --> 00:15:56,45
a start and we want to move today why so.

195
00:15:56,65 --> 00:16:00,39
We were always very honest and i told mr.

196
00:16:00,39 --> 00:16:06,63
Jones and i don't remember the
amount we were behind in meant

197
00:16:08,09 --> 00:16:08,80
but they gave but

198
00:16:08,80 --> 00:16:17,40
a clear bill to move out and i'm
sure that was the end gorman.

199
00:16:17,42 --> 00:16:24,42
And so we moved down to day. Y
and i started on the buses. What

200
00:16:24,43 --> 00:16:29,60
from the depot down it brooke. Was it
you know i know that was it. Actually i

201
00:16:29,61 --> 00:16:35,74
started to burwood depot. I used to
have to hit. From nine cove to berlin

202
00:16:36,63 --> 00:16:43,33
and that was for five months and then i
got to kelso road. Martin and then from

203
00:16:43,34 --> 00:16:50,21
mosman i went to man any where the old
train depot us and from there i went to

204
00:16:50,21 --> 00:16:56,66
book my friends up where you're
a conductor or driver. I was

205
00:16:56,66 --> 00:17:00,83
a conductor for about eighteen
months and then i was

206
00:17:00,83 --> 00:17:04,78
a driver for the rest of the time you
won't be getting your first training as

207
00:17:04,78 --> 00:17:09,94
a conductor when you first started.
Yes very much very very you know.

208
00:17:11,82 --> 00:17:14,84
Well very interesting
situations occurred quite

209
00:17:14,84 --> 00:17:19,73
a time you do your three days with the
king. Yes yes i'm sure we did that. Yeah.

210
00:17:19,79 --> 00:17:24,29
Three days and that. That's right.
Your second chord there and

211
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,95
. When i was learning the ropes. We were
told the conductor was in charge of the

212
00:17:31,95 --> 00:17:38,77
people. Because i took buses in
preference to trams i stood down and

213
00:17:38,78 --> 00:17:45,66
cost me eleven days saying you
know and i was working with

214
00:17:45,66 --> 00:17:50,60
this fellow stand small
up for me would depend

215
00:17:53,23 --> 00:17:59,05
and being in charge as i thought i when
the bell for him to go. We're waiting at

216
00:17:59,79 --> 00:18:06,12
some place and he moved and i said
we're going right. You better go.

217
00:18:07,83 --> 00:18:08,16
We just took

218
00:18:08,16 --> 00:18:15,09
a chance and saying i'm entitled to this
but i'm telling you to go. He says i'm

219
00:18:15,09 --> 00:18:19,75
driving it. And i'm stopping here. And
that was it the reason he was waiting was

220
00:18:19,75 --> 00:18:25,67
for the pick to care. I think
it was you know i will bust him

221
00:18:25,68 --> 00:18:32,56
a couple of times so i went so that was
my first experience in networks. You were

222
00:18:32,56 --> 00:18:33,86
in charge of the passengers and he was

223
00:18:33,86 --> 00:18:39,15
a jar to the basket. Yeah. Actually that's
what it was it's doing the driving idea

224
00:18:39,15 --> 00:18:41,76
that you know what you
want. I found that i want

225
00:18:43,45 --> 00:18:50,32
a driver with tact or you know man
that good job. You know so i was i was

226
00:18:50,32 --> 00:18:55,13
twenty twenty seven years on the buses and

227
00:18:59,43 --> 00:18:59,68
three and

228
00:18:59,68 --> 00:19:05,74
a half years in there when we went in the
army during the second world war when did

229
00:19:05,74 --> 00:19:11,37
you go in. Just after the japanese came
in. Well i think that was fully one of

230
00:19:11,37 --> 00:19:13,97
forty to december. It's

231
00:19:13,98 --> 00:19:18,89
a matter of fact i got on the phone to
go over and enlist the lieutenant cutler

232
00:19:20,06 --> 00:19:20,45
received

233
00:19:20,46 --> 00:19:26,31
a hero's welcome back to manly off the same
ferry i said to my wife jokingly i said

234
00:19:26,31 --> 00:19:31,29
don't you know mob to say is or.
It was for lieutenant country

235
00:19:33,26 --> 00:19:40,25
and where did you serve. I went to encamp
from the showground i went up to dubbo

236
00:19:41,34 --> 00:19:47,22
down to bathurst. And then we went to the
middle east and i didn't see any action

237
00:19:47,22 --> 00:19:52,56
in the middle east. We were
videos and where you were work

238
00:19:53,33 --> 00:19:58,42
reinforcements and they were inclined to
look down on reinforcements because they

239
00:19:58,42 --> 00:20:05,13
should have been in from the beginning as
i say. And we're in camp at news about

240
00:20:07,64 --> 00:20:13,48
and then. Allow i mean took place while we
were there some some of the fellows went

241
00:20:13,48 --> 00:20:20,31
up after i mean finished and the
next thing when you when you get

242
00:20:20,31 --> 00:20:26,86
anything clean up and we want to queen
mary jane came home and then you go to new

243
00:20:26,86 --> 00:20:33,35
kitty and i yeah yeah. After some leave.
I went to new guinea and we landed and

244
00:20:36,87 --> 00:20:43,40
. I think milne may was the first one not
in action that that actually happened.

245
00:20:44,43 --> 00:20:51,39
And from there we went to print chaffin

246
00:20:53,03 --> 00:20:55,83
and there saddleback and i got

247
00:20:55,83 --> 00:21:02,46
a bit crook. And then you know
i was sent back to hospital

248
00:21:02,46 --> 00:21:08,26
in the lie and then back to mostly we are
involved in any action up there now i

249
00:21:08,26 --> 00:21:13,22
find i'm missing gun in action. But i didn't
say i didn't see the enemy at all you

250
00:21:13,23 --> 00:21:16,29
know i didn't like so angry i
enlisted because i thought i had to

251
00:21:20,34 --> 00:21:23,25
the bombing. We were under bombing where
we were and then from places like that.

252
00:21:23,42 --> 00:21:30,13
That's right and i'll i tell me my shot at
the shooting. Yeah you know i thought it

253
00:21:30,14 --> 00:21:30,18
was

254
00:21:30,18 --> 00:21:33,42
a nasty feeling you hear the pop and say
well east and then you could hear the sbt

255
00:21:35,17 --> 00:21:36,87
. And i know the feeling
i was living there was

256
00:21:36,87 --> 00:21:41,40
a child doing that or going to know all
about that. I always believe that this

257
00:21:41,40 --> 00:21:48,34
evidence in the. England and you
got it worse than the soldiers

258
00:21:49,80 --> 00:21:53,65
and i don't about that but the europe
certainly got it worse. I think yes yes oh

259
00:21:53,65 --> 00:22:00,37
yes and when you got back. You were
invalided out where you were you know

260
00:22:00,37 --> 00:22:07,35
i was given the option and i manpower.
Me out and i said do you want to be

261
00:22:07,35 --> 00:22:14,02
manpower there. I got me after saying yes
or no and i said yes. So i was out and i

262
00:22:14,02 --> 00:22:20,76
went back to the buses. I just beat
the band when i enlisted. Because i

263
00:22:20,76 --> 00:22:27,73
stop the batsman from investing
just after i did and so i got

264
00:22:27,73 --> 00:22:32,16
back. Oh i am money was made up my way

265
00:22:35,63 --> 00:22:40,63
and just down the buzzer there for four.
Yes i was tired when i was twenty five.

266
00:22:40,91 --> 00:22:47,56
Well it's still twenty four years
ago now. That was well i got my

267
00:22:47,56 --> 00:22:53,41

only i was on it but they both. And

269
00:23:01,72 --> 00:23:08,69

273
00:23:22,86 --> 00:23:26,35
I sat down and i know george just

274
00:23:26,35 --> 00:23:33,30

300
00:25:44,97 --> 00:25:50,53
frank hardy stood against me and bill
wentworth for the seat of my kill i don't

301
00:25:50,53 --> 00:25:56,89
because we couldn't get any money for
mars and let people know when our

302
00:25:56,89 --> 00:26:03,83
candidate. I would say moved to
against you know ice and we poll

303
00:26:03,83 --> 00:26:10,82
fairly well meant no way we were going
to win it. And i remember neck night and

304
00:26:10,82 --> 00:26:17,20
the poll. Frank i was there and
bill went with no other candidate

305
00:26:18,57 --> 00:26:20,74
and i wanted

306
00:26:20,74 --> 00:26:27,32

members and he read then all people
and not just one said people

308
00:26:35,35 --> 00:26:41,83

309
00:26:43,04 --> 00:26:48,18
who ended up getting that seat and was it
really when you see wentworth yeah the

310
00:26:48,19 --> 00:26:54,32
medevac prior to the actual
election. He was supposed to be

311
00:26:54,32 --> 00:27:00,25
a terrible murder driver he was in trouble.
Tell three times and i didn't want this

312
00:27:00,25 --> 00:27:06,38
damn thing you know i didn't want it anyway.
I ran to the labor party candidate. So

313
00:27:06,39 --> 00:27:13,31
i said to myra my wife. I
just found out today that if

314
00:27:13,31 --> 00:27:19,22

go live right through this damn thing

316
00:27:23,09 --> 00:27:27,03
because i don't i don't you know. But anyway
he lived through and as you know he's

317
00:27:27,03 --> 00:27:33,16
a pretty by play but he was he was one
piece of white smoke where you call an

318
00:27:33,16 --> 00:27:37,12
antithesis or something like
that. He make and there was

319
00:27:37,12 --> 00:27:40,42
a communist and when he met and
bill white they reckon it was

320
00:27:40,42 --> 00:27:46,76
a capitalist. Yes of course. Oh
yes he did man he went with time

321
00:27:47,62 --> 00:27:54,17
. But i used to send all our fellows
to him but you commonwealths as

322
00:27:54,18 --> 00:27:56,55
they were in time about that was

323
00:27:56,55 --> 00:28:01,73
a job. Did you get involved at all during
the period with the groups against the

324
00:28:01,73 --> 00:28:03,02
communists. Yes yes

325
00:28:03,02 --> 00:28:09,24
a matter fact. Do you know. The first
occasion was rent time too early

326
00:28:10,84 --> 00:28:17,24
and it counted from now been stood
and i was his campaign manager.

327
00:28:18,22 --> 00:28:24,75
And i didn't know anything about groups
they were how death but i didn't i was

328
00:28:24,75 --> 00:28:31,45
a catholic but i wasn't practicing and i
wasn't satiated with any group at all

329
00:28:33,32 --> 00:28:39,55
and i couldn't believe it. You know we
didn't want to coming into this and

330
00:28:40,51 --> 00:28:45,83
that was when we were mainly napa and
these fellows were pointed out to me that

331
00:28:45,83 --> 00:28:52,29
were active and then they know when
time stood the group trying to get it

332
00:28:53,72 --> 00:29:00,27
and they nearly succeeded and i move the
amendment. He was going to be censured and

333
00:29:00,28 --> 00:29:06,78
and move on. That's been something i feel
right now and i move the amendment that

334
00:29:06,78 --> 00:29:13,72
was carried that he acted in good faith of
the big article in the hell that him and

335
00:29:13,73 --> 00:29:20,70
the group tied together. Why the
fellers. I can't think we know

336
00:29:20,70 --> 00:29:25,84
stills from any human associated with the
major he was one of the active members

337
00:29:26,54 --> 00:29:31,12
