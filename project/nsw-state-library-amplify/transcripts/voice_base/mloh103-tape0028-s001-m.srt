1
00:00:14,94 --> 00:00:17,39
No. So i thought of.

2
00:00:18,00 --> 00:00:24,99
And i think i'm too close
with well you know.

3
00:00:25,80 --> 00:00:31,11
You know for us. High.
On world thing you know.

4
00:00:33,32 --> 00:00:39,94
And this is going to go awry
how did i come to nimbin.

5
00:00:40,24 --> 00:00:44,24
Was that. Back when the couriers
first it was first happening.

6
00:00:44,61 --> 00:00:49,64
Or even before then actually used to come
down here to go down to byron 30 actually.

7
00:00:50,30 --> 00:00:51,35
Around broken head

8
00:00:53,04 --> 00:00:58,40
and being involved probably from the
60s with the the new age of the hippie

9
00:00:58,40 --> 00:00:59,63
movement of that was then

10
00:01:01,74 --> 00:01:06,12
and being somewhat very radical myself
looking for an alternative in life.

11
00:01:08,01 --> 00:01:15,33
Not being happy with the system
of the rot of the system.

12
00:01:16,04 --> 00:01:18,25
Sort of used to venture around
going to different places

13
00:01:19,29 --> 00:01:22,17
and i can actually remember.

14
00:01:22,19 --> 00:01:27,64
I think the first tour they
have the ties quite a lot.

15
00:01:27,65 --> 00:01:30,95
And decided to come down and check it out.

16
00:01:31,09 --> 00:01:34,25
I came down with a group of friends
living in brisbane at the time

17
00:01:35,24 --> 00:01:40,61
and living in a community how to get me
an old style house a number of us living

18
00:01:40,61 --> 00:01:45,35
there. And we all decide to come
down and see what was happening.

19
00:01:45,42 --> 00:01:50,76
So we came down before the festival.
It was sort of interesting.

20
00:01:51,73 --> 00:01:56,11
You know getting out of a.
Smoking and tripping whatever.

21
00:01:57,44 --> 00:01:59,90
It's always good to get out in the
country especially if you're tripping.

22
00:02:00,70 --> 00:02:03,76
When our 30th sort of it's
nice to get away from people

23
00:02:03,76 --> 00:02:07,71
and you can sort of be relaxed an
environment that you feel safe in

24
00:02:07,71 --> 00:02:10,83
and sort of logic itself get into nature.

25
00:02:12,49 --> 00:02:16,56
So they don't survive as a real bars and
coming down here and it's a nice area

26
00:02:16,56 --> 00:02:20,88
and people seem friendly and
interesting things going on

27
00:02:21,92 --> 00:02:25,39
and they were in the first of all
this happening it was quite a vase.

28
00:02:28,19 --> 00:02:34,08
Just i suppose the people there
apart from the area the land.

29
00:02:34,11 --> 00:02:39,51
I mean it's obviously unique
obviously. It is different.

30
00:02:39,70 --> 00:02:43,94
It has a lot to offer. So i
think the people at the time.

31
00:02:45,02 --> 00:02:47,28
When the first of all is
on it was very colourful.

32
00:02:47,92 --> 00:02:51,01
So if i remember it was
sort of towards the end of

33
00:02:51,01 --> 00:02:54,46
when all the festivals were
happening from the 60s it was

34
00:02:55,27 --> 00:03:00,20
when they started you know
dying out that there.

35
00:03:00,29 --> 00:03:01,97
This aquarius testable happened

36
00:03:03,80 --> 00:03:08,51
and it was interest seeing
it was it could be and they.

37
00:03:08,54 --> 00:03:11,17
The whole town i suppose is hold
a little village being there.

38
00:03:11,24 --> 00:03:15,08
All these shops and things and set
up there a sort of wander around

39
00:03:15,08 --> 00:03:20,50
and help yourselves. You
know. Get out of it.

40
00:03:22,35 --> 00:03:28,08
Sort of you know. The actual hills
around at when the festival was on.

41
00:03:28,89 --> 00:03:33,77
Well it was only virtually directly around
the town itself so you know the people

42
00:03:33,77 --> 00:03:39,29
would sort of mingled around the
hills and camped tense all sorts of.

43
00:03:39,67 --> 00:03:45,93
Unique dwellings a load
of. Temporary drilling.

44
00:03:47,82 --> 00:03:51,66
I suppose that was typical for those
the first two rules of around

45
00:03:51,66 --> 00:03:58,20
that time was to love experimenting looking
searching sort of looking at consistent

46
00:03:58,20 --> 00:03:59,35
new ideas and.

47
00:04:02,79 --> 00:04:05,38
Once sort of interacting
with different people.

48
00:04:16,14 --> 00:04:20,26
Like.

49
00:04:22,91 --> 00:04:25,92
High life high life.

50
00:04:25,93 --> 00:04:32,38
I suppose there was no
one pacific or major one

51
00:04:32,38 --> 00:04:35,56
that i can think oh
this is that i suppose.

52
00:04:35,58 --> 00:04:41,06
The whole essence of the festival in the
feeling of the area was yeah it's nice

53
00:04:41,06 --> 00:04:43,69
it's great you know be nice
to be able to live this way.

54
00:04:45,79 --> 00:04:50,13
You know it's stimulating exciting as.

55
00:04:51,64 --> 00:04:57,39
It's good and sought after the
first or going back to verse and.

56
00:04:57,41 --> 00:05:00,66
The usual stuff where you know have to
fall back into the system in the right

57
00:05:00,66 --> 00:05:04,36
and not feeling happy about

58
00:05:04,36 --> 00:05:08,50
and then go back down to nimbin some
months later to check it out again

59
00:05:08,50 --> 00:05:14,96
that sort of finding it sort of changed
there was even a different feeling amongst

60
00:05:14,96 --> 00:05:17,99
the people. There's some
sort of resentment.

61
00:05:18,01 --> 00:05:24,62
And i think it was to do with you know like
with it with anything is for something

62
00:05:24,62 --> 00:05:28,26
to actually happen it needs
energy to go into it so it needs.

63
00:05:28,87 --> 00:05:30,01
The energy comes from the heart

64
00:05:30,01 --> 00:05:33,97
and therefore if we're not putting the
energy into it then it's not really

65
00:05:33,97 --> 00:05:37,29
happening and the sort of get people that.

66
00:05:37,31 --> 00:05:41,73
They just appear just purely for
what they can get out of it

67
00:05:41,73 --> 00:05:45,63
and don't put anything into it
and because it doesn't work.

68
00:05:46,03 --> 00:05:48,01
You get too many people doing that.

69
00:05:48,19 --> 00:05:54,69
It's just you then start getting resentment
from other people because it's not

70
00:05:54,69 --> 00:05:58,16
enhancing it's not adding to the
whole thing is just taking from it.

71
00:05:58,20 --> 00:05:59,40
I think that's why.

72
00:06:01,60 --> 00:06:03,20
The particular feeling of the place

73
00:06:03,20 --> 00:06:09,67
and was you know the suspicion also you
know of you know you know what do you want

74
00:06:09,67 --> 00:06:15,58
you know what are you doing here. You know
what do you want from us. So there's a.

75
00:06:15,60 --> 00:06:18,42
What you felt.

76
00:06:18,43 --> 00:06:23,18
It was yeah yeah that
was a few months after.

77
00:06:23,57 --> 00:06:27,70
And then i think probably a year a year

78
00:06:27,70 --> 00:06:34,17
and a half after the first of all went
back and the feeling was strongly there.

79
00:06:35,09 --> 00:06:41,72
And it's also the other thing
else when the actual communities

80
00:06:41,73 --> 00:06:44,58
or communes as they were then were forming

81
00:06:44,58 --> 00:06:50,18
and cooperatives the just wondering
how to say forward actually being

82
00:06:50,18 --> 00:06:56,65
and if it would work and trying to
break away from my own. Feelings or.

83
00:06:57,29 --> 00:07:00,31
Conditionings of security in the system.

84
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:06,09
Breaking away from you know the false sense
of the security of you know having a

85
00:07:06,09 --> 00:07:08,47
job and having money and
having a gun and a house

86
00:07:08,47 --> 00:07:12,21
and you got all the structure around you
that you can hide in the pool or you

87
00:07:13,74 --> 00:07:19,19
and all your friends there. I suppose
you friends on you know and.

88
00:07:21,06 --> 00:07:26,39
Sort of breaking away from that as i
found it was actually very difficult.

89
00:07:26,41 --> 00:07:32,87
And coming to a place where you
sort of did a different creation

90
00:07:32,87 --> 00:07:35,80
and even though it stimulating
exciting there still.

91
00:07:35,84 --> 00:07:37,66
The fear sake try to think of it.

92
00:07:39,12 --> 00:07:44,00
Will i survive in this or relate freakout
or well i lose whatever it is i.

93
00:07:44,20 --> 00:07:49,47
I already have. You can't pull
you through that you know.

94
00:07:49,72 --> 00:07:52,73
To challenge. Yeah i think so.

95
00:07:52,75 --> 00:07:57,37
I find in most of them probably and
also now they have these two aspects

96
00:07:58,37 --> 00:08:00,98
and i suppose. Maybe we all do

97
00:08:00,98 --> 00:08:03,17
or a lot of people do we
have many different aspects.

98
00:08:03,69 --> 00:08:07,31
Whenever it is but there seems to be
these two major aspects and one is

99
00:08:07,31 --> 00:08:10,98
that i can fit into the system
quite easily and play it again

100
00:08:12,07 --> 00:08:17,57
and it because it's easy to do you know
you can just fall into it and so on.

101
00:08:19,16 --> 00:08:22,22
You know you just become
like a clone artist.

102
00:08:23,77 --> 00:08:28,72
But even though it was
easy to do that and to be

103
00:08:28,72 --> 00:08:32,92
that i there's this other aspect
of me that is very radical

104
00:08:33,97 --> 00:08:37,94
and it sort of says you know i need to be
looked at i need to be express you know

105
00:08:37,94 --> 00:08:44,63
this isn't a feeling me
doing this and so i find

106
00:08:44,63 --> 00:08:48,11
when i look look at that aspect of
myself that it wants to challenge all

107
00:08:48,11 --> 00:08:51,37
that it doesn't want to
play by all these rules

108
00:08:51,37 --> 00:08:56,80
that they were created by someone
else that those. That really.

109
00:08:56,82 --> 00:09:03,00
I just i don't know i just challenge
your region it wasn't for feeling in me

110
00:09:04,89 --> 00:09:07,49
so.

111
00:09:07,50 --> 00:09:14,36
Sort of realizing that there's this
aspect of me that i need to feel and.

112
00:09:15,31 --> 00:09:16,53
I guess.

113
00:09:16,55 --> 00:09:21,31
That also covers all that's pretty true
and for oneself in lifestyle sexuality.

114
00:09:22,86 --> 00:09:28,12
The whole life. Plays.

115
00:09:28,83 --> 00:09:33,92
Toast. That's a good
question. I'm not so sure.

116
00:09:35,01 --> 00:09:39,75
It's it's reasonably i find it.

117
00:09:40,96 --> 00:09:45,56
On the one of the groups you know first.

118
00:09:46,34 --> 00:09:50,36
How we're there for field.

119
00:09:50,38 --> 00:09:57,28
No i don't think they are.

120
00:09:58,60 --> 00:10:05,12
Yeah so i guess. I don't really know if
my exit expectations had been for soon.

121
00:10:05,40 --> 00:10:10,82
You know because i finally still questioning
things i still looking at myself

122
00:10:10,82 --> 00:10:14,82
and. What's reflecting back around me.

123
00:10:17,57 --> 00:10:19,79
I further wonder if that's
just an ongoing seeing

124
00:10:19,79 --> 00:10:22,38
or you know like how we
create things around us

125
00:10:22,38 --> 00:10:27,82
and we get caught up in our own creations
and you know the more we put into it.

126
00:10:27,93 --> 00:10:32,10
This gets going on and
maybe we need to drop all.

127
00:10:32,12 --> 00:10:35,05
But.

128
00:10:36,53 --> 00:10:41,83
Just recently i've been looking at how
i feel and with where i am now i hear

129
00:10:41,83 --> 00:10:46,19
and dylan clues and after
being here for 10 years.

130
00:10:46,21 --> 00:10:50,72
And how it's developed and. And.

131
00:10:50,74 --> 00:10:56,73
I find you know looking more into myself
too as to maybe looking at things like

132
00:10:56,73 --> 00:11:03,26
one's own selfishness and what we need
out a life or feel we need out of life.

133
00:11:04,44 --> 00:11:08,51
What what i'm actually doing in my life
as to where i'm putting my energies

134
00:11:09,49 --> 00:11:10,34
and maybe part of

135
00:11:10,34 --> 00:11:14,13
that is still creating what i was
trying to get away from before

136
00:11:14,98 --> 00:11:17,57
and bringing it all here with
me and creating it again

137
00:11:19,42 --> 00:11:21,12
or whether it's all actually here anyway.

138
00:11:21,12 --> 00:11:24,61
And you know it's all in
there within one's own life.

139
00:11:25,17 --> 00:11:33,39
It was.

140
00:11:34,35 --> 00:11:37,07
I feel asian.

141
00:11:37,09 --> 00:11:40,37
Well yeah if you're to go back to the
equator is still a thing because

142
00:11:40,37 --> 00:11:42,68
that was some time back.

143
00:11:44,29 --> 00:11:45,42
Going back 20 years ago

144
00:11:46,17 --> 00:11:51,02
and then it was a period of probably 10
years before i actually started living here

145
00:11:51,02 --> 00:11:55,36
in this area. And.

146
00:11:55,38 --> 00:11:59,72
Eventually when i made that break and you
know came here and looked at this place.

147
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,85
And it was just a cattle property and
thinking god you know this looks like.

148
00:12:07,06 --> 00:12:09,76
On the surface it didn't look very
good. It just looks like a paddock.

149
00:12:10,66 --> 00:12:11,82
But the feeling under me.

150
00:12:11,83 --> 00:12:14,94
Is there was a feeling some
feeling about it and that's

151
00:12:14,94 --> 00:12:19,84
when i clicked into that's
what i like it and.

152
00:12:19,86 --> 00:12:22,53
So i decided to buy

153
00:12:22,53 --> 00:12:27,80
and then ended up moving here finally
breaking hours in the system

154
00:12:27,80 --> 00:12:33,95
and moving here then interacting with
the land and the people i was at

155
00:12:33,96 --> 00:12:36,71
that particular stage
in going through court.

156
00:12:36,73 --> 00:12:41,80
You know major court case which went for
eight months in a bikini sort of like

157
00:12:41,80 --> 00:12:44,27
having manages and no proper roads

158
00:12:44,27 --> 00:12:48,74
and it rained for nearly
eight months just during

159
00:12:48,74 --> 00:12:51,99
that so to.

160
00:12:52,87 --> 00:12:58,42
Even though at times it was very testing
you think shit. When i married you were.

161
00:12:59,17 --> 00:13:03,48
Well it's out there especially with
court cases and that because you think.

162
00:13:03,64 --> 00:13:05,79
I came here to get away
from all that stuff

163
00:13:05,79 --> 00:13:09,91
and fairly it's all here even
more so more confronted by it

164
00:13:12,00 --> 00:13:16,59
but then the realisation in that is that
food like trying to avoid something

165
00:13:16,59 --> 00:13:22,56
or running away from something you further
caught there you got to you have to

166
00:13:22,56 --> 00:13:28,29
confront it and go through it. So
all so well that was happening.

167
00:13:28,45 --> 00:13:32,56
Interacting with the land and that that
was really great and even the rain.

168
00:13:32,63 --> 00:13:37,15
It was good. It was good. Walking the
land it was digging holes planting a tree

169
00:13:37,85 --> 00:13:41,27
and sort of getting mud all
the dirt on your hands.

170
00:13:42,55 --> 00:13:46,19
It was good school and.

171
00:13:46,21 --> 00:13:49,61
Even the whole pioneering spirit
of it and the other people

172
00:13:49,61 --> 00:13:51,16
that sort of moved in

173
00:13:51,16 --> 00:13:56,25
and sort of just finding
out how diverse people are

174
00:13:56,25 --> 00:14:02,39
and i guess the old turn ative tends
to attract people. At a very diverse.

175
00:14:02,41 --> 00:14:05,86
You know. So like me they sort of.

176
00:14:05,88 --> 00:14:12,14
Want to get away from a system that
tends to just clone people stereo time.

177
00:14:12,16 --> 00:14:14,89
But in that diversity.

178
00:14:14,91 --> 00:14:20,49
You can find five you know people can be
can sing totally different to you can have

179
00:14:20,49 --> 00:14:23,38
totally different person
first section of a liar

180
00:14:25,25 --> 00:14:27,34
when it comes to consensus of agreement.

181
00:14:27,97 --> 00:14:34,32
And it is you know it's not there for
the other aspect of that is that.

182
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:38,41
You can learn a lot in
really start learning

183
00:14:38,41 --> 00:14:41,76
and i mean you start interacting with
people these different kinds tests and.

184
00:14:41,94 --> 00:14:43,02
Different ideas

185
00:14:43,02 --> 00:14:48,99
and i think our yeah it's interesting.

186
00:14:49,81 --> 00:14:52,57
So then getting on with a
few years after being here.

187
00:14:52,80 --> 00:14:56,24
Sort of really starting to
develop in getting into the land

188
00:14:56,24 --> 00:14:57,59
and going through different stages.

189
00:14:59,28 --> 00:15:05,30
I would like meditating getting into a
working meditation as sort of not seeing

190
00:15:05,30 --> 00:15:06,61
people for weeks on end.

191
00:15:09,57 --> 00:15:15,04
And create a really good getting into
the feeling of the land of the live

192
00:15:15,05 --> 00:15:20,27
or the energy or whatever you thought if
you want to call it all was brilliant.

193
00:15:20,63 --> 00:15:26,01
I think those particular
that particular time.

194
00:15:27,52 --> 00:15:30,99
Were was really pretty and when
i when i reflect back on it.

195
00:15:31,96 --> 00:15:34,45
It was good that pathology
the feeling of it.

196
00:15:34,45 --> 00:15:39,58
Ok i get up in the morning and just spend
the whole day working in the garden

197
00:15:41,25 --> 00:15:43,34
and staying there until the sun went down

198
00:15:44,46 --> 00:15:49,47
and even if it was rainy is
to get out there and book.

199
00:15:50,29 --> 00:15:52,43
And it was a work it was
really work. It was.

200
00:15:53,34 --> 00:15:59,03
It was an enjoyable doing. The mall.

201
00:16:03,08 --> 00:16:07,14
Yeah just getting out there and
just working in the garden

202
00:16:07,14 --> 00:16:13,95
but it wasn't really work. It was an enjoyment
it was like there was a meditation.

203
00:16:13,96 --> 00:16:19,28
And so building a rock or going into
rock and i started going rock all.

204
00:16:20,72 --> 00:16:22,98
And i really enjoyed

205
00:16:22,98 --> 00:16:29,89
that because it's just by handling the
rock picking them up there you know they

206
00:16:29,89 --> 00:16:33,52
had their different sizes different
textures feeling about it and

207
00:16:34,26 --> 00:16:35,87
and the way to the right.

208
00:16:36,03 --> 00:16:41,39
And also there's this feeling like
an energy you get from a rock

209
00:16:41,39 --> 00:16:47,26
and it was just amazing experience
to bring you know really light.

210
00:16:47,97 --> 00:16:52,07
And building the wall of birds when
you see unfinished sort of you know

211
00:16:52,07 --> 00:16:54,38
when you start being creative with it

212
00:16:54,38 --> 00:16:58,88
and putting patterns in
the wall of the night.

213
00:16:59,26 --> 00:17:04,78
To create a great.

214
00:17:05,89 --> 00:17:11,28
Thing getting into building a house.

215
00:17:12,21 --> 00:17:17,62
So you can see the house and.

216
00:17:19,48 --> 00:17:21,05
I guess in the beginning i used to.

217
00:17:21,23 --> 00:17:26,03
I think chemo 12 is the time people are
going to build our place to wonder about

218
00:17:26,03 --> 00:17:31,60
things she can i get to build a house
and i've never built a house before.

219
00:17:31,62 --> 00:17:36,15
They're finally getting to a point where i
thought of you know really have to do it

220
00:17:36,15 --> 00:17:39,39
had to build a house so ideas and.

221
00:17:40,63 --> 00:17:42,42
So we've my particular nature

222
00:17:42,42 --> 00:17:48,89
or bringing order from my manic
approach will be hazier i'm sort of

223
00:17:50,45 --> 00:17:54,51
tend to be more into.

224
00:17:54,53 --> 00:17:59,94
Detail and you know sort
of. Making things sort of.

225
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,52
So that's there is there.
The. They look for a site.

226
00:18:05,91 --> 00:18:11,95
I think is a word for it and.

227
00:18:11,96 --> 00:18:14,84
I suppose being particular.

228
00:18:14,86 --> 00:18:16,76
And going through

229
00:18:16,76 --> 00:18:21,96
that experience for a couple of years doing
it by myself because i wanted to sort

230
00:18:21,97 --> 00:18:26,44
of challenge or idea of challenger was
some sort of eager thing or whatever.

231
00:18:29,35 --> 00:18:31,18
Without power tools all by hand

232
00:18:33,62 --> 00:18:36,25
and a helluva lot of work a lot of energy

233
00:18:37,60 --> 00:18:43,88
and i used to really just myself
out at full time doing it really

234
00:18:43,89 --> 00:18:50,83
frustrated sort of hitting a nail in a sort
of with the religious farmers on their.

235
00:18:50,84 --> 00:18:52,63
Shoes.

236
00:18:52,65 --> 00:18:54,84
You know i get really aggro about it

237
00:18:54,84 --> 00:18:59,88
and throw the hammer over the roof
of really doors we jump up and down

238
00:18:59,88 --> 00:19:06,35
and whatever. And it's been the rest
of the day looking for the hammer.

239
00:19:06,37 --> 00:19:07,02
Mr.

240
00:19:10,86 --> 00:19:15,08
I suppose it had a sense a
reward you know and movie.

241
00:19:15,36 --> 00:19:18,71
I wonder about the things
we do that we don't realize

242
00:19:18,71 --> 00:19:21,90
when we you know like you get
satisfaction out of it and to achievement

243
00:19:21,90 --> 00:19:23,74
or whatever and i think

244
00:19:23,74 --> 00:19:27,23
when you do something it someone gives
you a pat on the back in some way

245
00:19:27,23 --> 00:19:31,92
that enhances you too. To make
you feel good about it and.

246
00:19:31,93 --> 00:19:35,58
So there was great in people
you know even though it's good

247
00:19:35,58 --> 00:19:38,39
and i think i thought
and now i look at it.

248
00:19:38,42 --> 00:19:41,24
I think yeah well it's a how
they do i guess is there

249
00:19:42,85 --> 00:19:47,14
but i don't really think of it that i
filled it that you know with my own sweat

250
00:19:47,15 --> 00:19:49,79
and blood that went into it
and how i'd paint over it.

251
00:19:49,90 --> 00:19:52,16
I sort of forgotten or i don't
want to remember all that.

252
00:19:53,54 --> 00:19:55,08
I think you know like

253
00:19:56,11 --> 00:19:59,68
but i don't know whether i do it
again if i did i do it differently.

254
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,23
I wouldn't do it but they
probably power to it.

255
00:20:06,77 --> 00:20:09,79
But it hating generated.

256
00:20:20,57 --> 00:20:23,43
As for now what's going on with the.

257
00:20:24,40 --> 00:20:30,82
What we allot of her vehicle the next
stage of of our growth or development.

258
00:20:31,02 --> 00:20:36,74
That's a good word you think
growth of better. Of the village.

259
00:20:36,76 --> 00:20:37,75
Bill and will include

260
00:20:37,75 --> 00:20:43,76
and it is a village natural village
with the commercial centre and and all.

261
00:20:44,89 --> 00:20:45,65
And i can see that.

262
00:20:45,73 --> 00:20:50,31
Yeah it's great to be good to have a
commercial centre down there abilities centres

263
00:20:50,31 --> 00:20:55,66
in a commercial for a village centre
sort of like the heart of the village

264
00:20:57,43 --> 00:21:01,70
and either just remind me too that.

265
00:21:01,72 --> 00:21:03,89
An aspect of being in a community

266
00:21:05,17 --> 00:21:08,87
and even though it's not a
commune it's a community.

267
00:21:08,89 --> 00:21:12,08
Just like village of the
community but because it's.

268
00:21:12,75 --> 00:21:16,75
Something about their
one part a lot of land

269
00:21:17,96 --> 00:21:19,13
or whatever it is then

270
00:21:19,91 --> 00:21:22,76
that if there's a binding there
it's like an extended family

271
00:21:23,56 --> 00:21:25,31
and even if even if the people here

272
00:21:25,31 --> 00:21:29,89
that you may never talk to you still
have this thing they're finding

273
00:21:31,62 --> 00:21:37,73
and play and i think there's
a sort of interest thing

274
00:21:37,73 --> 00:21:41,14
that could cause a lot of
good at that to some time.

275
00:21:42,04 --> 00:21:43,07
It may not be so good

276
00:21:43,07 --> 00:21:51,80
and it's sort of a.

277
00:21:51,82 --> 00:21:53,60
I suppose it's there.

278
00:21:53,60 --> 00:21:59,95
Yeah i think you do and maybe it's
something you sort of take to grant.

279
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,95
When bert.

280
00:22:04,97 --> 00:22:08,92
And recently i've been looking
at what i'm doing here

281
00:22:08,92 --> 00:22:10,81
and want to getting out of this place and.

282
00:22:11,33 --> 00:22:14,58
If it is what are we creating it's just

283
00:22:14,58 --> 00:22:19,63
that the reliever again because
they can see that here to suburbia

284
00:22:19,63 --> 00:22:23,99
and the new killer family
when you go to parties

285
00:22:23,99 --> 00:22:26,40
and it all revolves around
the family structure

286
00:22:26,40 --> 00:22:31,85
and you know how johnny going at school
and you know when the school fete is on

287
00:22:32,91 --> 00:22:36,20
and all that sort of stuff
and up to me i find

288
00:22:36,20 --> 00:22:43,06
that just oriented you
know there's no there's

289
00:22:43,07 --> 00:22:47,69
no definite for me really. And
specially for my radical.

290
00:22:49,10 --> 00:22:52,96
And i think you know this really where i
want to be here is really right i warrant

291
00:22:55,29 --> 00:22:57,71
and then looking at
that if you will. Okay.

292
00:22:57,82 --> 00:23:00,58
You know that's not what i want
what i don't do something about it.

293
00:23:01,94 --> 00:23:06,03
Bringing my radical side more out
expressing that and seeing what happens.

294
00:23:06,56 --> 00:23:12,77
Or you know being more honest
without that a victim and by doing

295
00:23:12,77 --> 00:23:19,77
that finding that the reaction coming
back is yeah why not do it. Yes but.

296
00:23:20,27 --> 00:23:24,95
There are other people other energy there
that a similar one of the things thing

297
00:23:26,95 --> 00:23:29,70
and i feel a need for that too.

298
00:23:30,77 --> 00:23:37,29
So okay start doing that and if that
draws other energy other people that.

299
00:23:37,97 --> 00:23:41,15
Feel it being then why not.

300
00:23:41,35 --> 00:23:46,56
Who knows what may happen.

301
00:23:46,58 --> 00:23:49,78
I suppose.

302
00:23:49,79 --> 00:23:56,50
Bring it to bring out my radicalized
state of what i call radically new

303
00:23:56,50 --> 00:23:59,68
concepts of the way we live.
Rather than how we've.

304
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:07,00
Brought up of conditions to feel we should
live life in this the new killer family

305
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:11,26
thing the the marriage thing the the
male female the one to one and all

306
00:24:11,26 --> 00:24:12,04
that sort of stuff

307
00:24:13,81 --> 00:24:18,38
that possibly.

308
00:24:18,40 --> 00:24:23,90
I think there's very few people that could
really add here or find in the style

309
00:24:23,90 --> 00:24:25,18
that that's where they're

310
00:24:26,81 --> 00:24:31,62
that there's one to one thing
even milder female thing is

311
00:24:31,63 --> 00:24:38,21
that i think very few people actually
find that totally for feeling.

312
00:24:38,23 --> 00:24:42,29
But if they can just go along with
it because that's the way it is

313
00:24:42,29 --> 00:24:46,32
and they see they don't question
that or they say find they can't

314
00:24:46,32 --> 00:24:50,53
or they don't want to. And.

315
00:24:51,56 --> 00:24:56,37
That possibly in oh i feel that in life.

316
00:24:59,56 --> 00:25:01,04
If it's all interaction.

317
00:25:01,10 --> 00:25:05,11
Because possibly just one
tiny is interaction and

318
00:25:05,11 --> 00:25:08,37
that where is strict ing ourselves
and one to one relationship

319
00:25:09,43 --> 00:25:15,97
that we're not allowing ourselves to to
interact more to experience morning life.

320
00:25:16,77 --> 00:25:21,53
And things like how we
interact with people here.

321
00:25:21,74 --> 00:25:27,54
If you go to a social limitations all the
time even if you may want to to feel

322
00:25:27,54 --> 00:25:29,19
that you want to hear to that person

323
00:25:29,19 --> 00:25:32,84
or they might to you you still
restricted by this limitation.

324
00:25:33,31 --> 00:25:39,68
So you play along with that. And then coming
away from that situation and thinking.

325
00:25:40,75 --> 00:25:46,65
You know i can be boring. Done that. All
before and you know you know for you.

326
00:25:46,66 --> 00:25:47,97
Just not feeling something yourself

327
00:25:47,97 --> 00:25:51,30
and i think it's a spiritual
aspect of yourself of life

328
00:25:51,30 --> 00:25:53,34
that i should talk about myself.

329
00:25:54,28 --> 00:25:59,93
Maybe i find it not for filling
in my spiritual aspect of it.

330
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:10,31
Being able to relate to the renteria.

331
00:26:11,88 --> 00:26:17,18
Being a well person loads of
relating to me to my own gayness.

332
00:26:18,98 --> 00:26:24,70
Maybe yes i suppose it is but
i i think even if a person

333
00:26:24,70 --> 00:26:27,12
that was so caused great or heterosexual

334
00:26:28,42 --> 00:26:34,81
and i think the same thing was to apply
sexuality i think we're all just a sexual

335
00:26:36,29 --> 00:26:38,34
whether we're home with sexual or bisexual

336
00:26:38,34 --> 00:26:42,15
or heterosexual it's all
categorizing it all label and

337
00:26:43,17 --> 00:26:45,85
and sure you need to use
those words for expression

338
00:26:46,72 --> 00:26:48,16
but the realisation of where it's

339
00:26:48,16 --> 00:26:54,96
that is just individuality is
just individual asexual and.

340
00:26:56,99 --> 00:26:59,54
I suppose for myself in
happen the question.

341
00:26:59,56 --> 00:27:02,95
My own sexuality and with the
system growing up in the system

342
00:27:02,95 --> 00:27:07,79
that conditions are such that
heterosexuality is how it should be and

343
00:27:07,79 --> 00:27:10,75
that homosexual ideas. And bad.

344
00:27:10,79 --> 00:27:15,19
You know wrong or evil or something like.

345
00:27:16,88 --> 00:27:17,64
I suppose

346
00:27:17,64 --> 00:27:21,62
that in itself has made me question because
i have a feeling towards something

347
00:27:22,58 --> 00:27:26,32
and then at this point it telling me that
you can't do that or you shouldn't do

348
00:27:26,32 --> 00:27:27,98
that it contradicts

349
00:27:29,61 --> 00:27:34,24
and it's something i had to look at
in myself and come to terms with

350
00:27:35,55 --> 00:27:41,57
and i suppose by that is
accepting my own sexuality. But.

351
00:27:42,45 --> 00:27:44,98
And with. I mean accepted that sexuality.

352
00:27:45,24 --> 00:27:52,09
Then you can either fit it into a
particular sector of the system

353
00:27:52,09 --> 00:27:55,11
that is the gay ghetto or the gay movement

354
00:27:55,11 --> 00:27:59,95
or you know whether it be the men's
movement or as if you are a woman with.

355
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:02,99
There will and or you don't to be mourned
with the women's movement or whatever

356
00:28:02,99 --> 00:28:08,51
or whether it's capitalism or socialism

357
00:28:08,52 --> 00:28:11,66
or whatever.

358
00:28:12,48 --> 00:28:18,40
This is where you want to fit into
a life and i suppose coming here.

359
00:28:18,81 --> 00:28:25,81
Maybe more so because of my
for my so maybe i'm more

360
00:28:25,81 --> 00:28:32,56
my spiritual aspect of life of feeling
more fulfillment out of life brothers

361
00:28:32,56 --> 00:28:34,03
energy.

362
00:28:34,04 --> 00:28:39,76
Following a routine system that
i suppose wasn't stimulating

363
00:28:39,76 --> 00:28:50,40
and i was bored with the rut.

364
00:28:52,45 --> 00:28:56,26
I think that the hard way what
works for what is most spiritual

365
00:28:56,26 --> 00:29:02,29
that i could say something.

366
00:29:02,54 --> 00:29:05,88
Now but i could change on that
tomorrow in the next hour.

367
00:29:07,78 --> 00:29:11,42
But i'm trying to find the.

368
00:29:11,43 --> 00:29:18,37
Feeling of belonging integration
harmony the positive aspect

369
00:29:18,37 --> 00:29:20,67
love what i consider love positive

370
00:29:22,12 --> 00:29:27,08
and even for the negative aspect of life
which would come into the ages for i think

371
00:29:27,08 --> 00:29:29,44
it's a question of using
words that are you.

372
00:29:29,50 --> 00:29:34,59
I don't think you could you can put
your actual feeling at the fishery

373
00:29:34,59 --> 00:29:48,72
and you're your spiritual aspect of
feeling into words system possible.

374
00:29:48,74 --> 00:29:52,54
I don't know just to justify higher food.

375
00:29:53,79 --> 00:29:58,65
I suppose it's a harmonious feeling and
that includes everything positive negative.

376
00:29:59,12 --> 00:29:59,96
You know the union.

377
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,76
Like there's an awful feeling whole
more harmonious where there's

378
00:30:06,76 --> 00:30:13,51
trees around the greenery you haven't
got a concrete jungle where it's four

379
00:30:14,52 --> 00:30:15,63
corners and angles.

380
00:30:15,67 --> 00:30:22,65
And you know you you you have a
system where you've got to follow

381
00:30:22,65 --> 00:30:26,05
this particular line. You know if
you go down the road. You can't.

382
00:30:26,25 --> 00:30:32,90
You've got you've got have taken
for you you've got to follow a

383
00:30:32,90 --> 00:30:39,26
rigid rigid cord. Yeah.

384
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:44,06
Yeah and i think in

385
00:30:44,06 --> 00:30:50,76
that you see you i find in myself
that it was stopping a lot of my.

386
00:30:52,00 --> 00:30:57,97
And i feel it should shouldn't be the. You
know just a slight flow that there is.

387
00:30:59,76 --> 00:31:08,30
But there's waves it's slow it.

388
00:31:10,72 --> 00:31:13,38
Yeah right. Being gay and
being here in this place

389
00:31:13,38 --> 00:31:16,26
and do include those first coming here

390
00:31:16,26 --> 00:31:21,44
and moving from queensland where at the
time it was still illegal to be gay

391
00:31:21,44 --> 00:31:27,42
or you know. The the laws were
still against homosexuality.

392
00:31:27,44 --> 00:31:32,32
And even though i had sort of
already confronted my sexually.
