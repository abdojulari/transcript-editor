1
00:00:14,16 --> 00:00:18,24
Identification this is session three with FAITH BANDLER

2
00:00:18,24 --> 00:00:24,76
and Carolyn Craig recorded in Sydney on Friday night of May one thousand nine hundred seven

3
00:00:24,76 --> 00:00:38,81
and the take begins in about ten seconds time and of identifications aside one. FACE.

4
00:00:39,89 --> 00:00:48,4
How old were you when you decided to leave home. It's too long to remember but I think it for I was about ninety.

5
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:55,33
Me eighteen. And I went to perspire.

6
00:00:56,78 --> 00:01:01,23
And I was only there for a very short time I spent a lot of time at my grandmother's

7
00:01:02,21 --> 00:01:12,74
but I was only there for a very short time before nine thirty. Now in September of ninety eight thirty nine and.

8
00:01:13,7 --> 00:01:26,74
I remember the night was declared. I didn't mean much to me I thought well it's over there and I'm here.

9
00:01:26,76 --> 00:01:40,92
Although I knew that it would happen. Because Hitler had marched in. Austria. Czechoslovakia. And Poland.

10
00:01:41,63 --> 00:02:01,26
And I knew that the talks that Chamberlain to head with Hitler wasn't worth the paper they were recorded or. I somehow.

11
00:02:01,28 --> 00:02:09,53
Expected it. And yet I was still surprised I didn't know and I didn't even think I suppose.

12
00:02:10,00 --> 00:02:21,43
How it would affect us all in. Australia. But only a short time passed before people we're joining now.

13
00:02:21,45 --> 00:02:30,22
Didn't seem very long at all. And the young me and I would say main certainly older than me but still very young.

14
00:02:30,58 --> 00:02:42,96
In their twenty's. Like twenty's and thirty's. After a few months were beginning to join after course the Tweed.

15
00:02:43,86 --> 00:02:54,05
Where I was born. Wren very deeply in my veins and I would go back often once a month.

16
00:02:54,32 --> 00:03:03,8
Perhaps And each time I'd go there. I'd ask about a certain person. And they'd say Oh he's enlisted and where he is.

17
00:03:06,48 --> 00:03:10,12
And they were particularly women

18
00:03:10,13 --> 00:03:22,21
and gays who were nurses they were then their first postings of course was in the Middle East.

19
00:03:24,31 --> 00:03:33,81
And later of course increase. Can I ask you how you felt as a young woman when you had that board broken.

20
00:03:36,98 --> 00:03:48,62
Well a lot of young people were very excited because life would change for they made no way particularly the people

21
00:03:48,62 --> 00:03:55,68
around where I was blown because life was pretty monotonous and then all of a sudden you have a war

22
00:03:55,68 --> 00:04:05,38
and you see good looking blokes in uniforms around the streets and there they appear free as a bird in the air

23
00:04:05,38 --> 00:04:22,16
and we went crazy about them. So I felt I did. Feel that way. I think. I I didn't have a fear that.

24
00:04:22,94 --> 00:04:31,5
I wasn't excited about it is some people who are. There was a big very big change coming to this very isolated country.

25
00:04:32,89 --> 00:04:49,56
And it was hard to tell how. Most of us would react. For quite some months. But then I recall that it in my opinion.

26
00:04:49,58 --> 00:05:01,74
My brother eighty was the second eldest in march and rally. To me and. I've come to say goodbye my unit is about to go.

27
00:05:01,81 --> 00:05:08,67
Why are there no where. And so I said goodbye to him was no grief.

28
00:05:09,98 --> 00:05:12,95
Because I expressed automatically expected him to come back.

29
00:05:13,28 --> 00:05:20,01
That's how you thought at the early part of the war before the Japanese became involved in the.

30
00:05:20,03 --> 00:05:29,1
It was you automatically thought that everyone would come back. I did. And so was it good bye to him.

31
00:05:31,1 --> 00:05:43,44
Well later we learned that he was sent to Singapore. And Singapore fail. And he was interned by the Japanese.

32
00:05:43,46 --> 00:05:57,37
And then put to work on the runway. And then finally in. Forty three. I think it for. My mother had he done.

33
00:05:58,64 --> 00:06:07,91
And she was he had very very very very many years later many years later when the war was over

34
00:06:08,65 --> 00:06:15,84
and those who survived the Burma. Came home. One by the name of Sullivan.

35
00:06:16,46 --> 00:06:24,62
Friend of our families said No no he didn't do very he was well. Together with a group.

36
00:06:25,41 --> 00:06:40,13
Who didn't respond quickly enough from orders from the Japanese and they were just learned up and shot. So. You know.

37
00:06:41,01 --> 00:06:48,4
That news came through to me when I was in a place called one in New South Wales

38
00:06:51,3 --> 00:06:55,13
and it didn't have a deep souring impact on me because

39
00:06:55,13 --> 00:07:04,12
but I've seen we were picking up the newspaper each day not to read about in order to hear. But to read off.

40
00:07:04,52 --> 00:07:13,04
How many thousands had lost their lives in we were in or a ball in.

41
00:07:13,87 --> 00:07:18,59
The Wood death of a beautiful men and women the thousands.

42
00:07:18,92 --> 00:07:32,62
So my brother's death didn't have the impact on me that it had on my sisters and my mother for some reason or other.

43
00:07:32,64 --> 00:07:36,47
It wasn't until the war was over. Finally over.

44
00:07:36,61 --> 00:07:46,08
We're dancing in the streets that that loss hit me that I wouldn't see him again. But.

45
00:07:47,48 --> 00:07:54,33
I was born at the end of the First World for. And there were people around who.

46
00:07:54,35 --> 00:07:59,63
Photographs of their husbands and brothers and uncles.

47
00:07:59,65 --> 00:08:06,12
Sometimes whole families almost Australian families were wiped out in the first world war

48
00:08:06,12 --> 00:08:20,07
and only twenty years that passed and we were involved in. And I had a friend. Who had a daughter twin.

49
00:08:20,09 --> 00:08:30,17
And one some of us a left turn and or captain in the Army and the other was a squadron leader in the Air Force.

50
00:08:30,18 --> 00:08:37,37
And within a week to week she had news that both had been killed. So.

51
00:08:39,84 --> 00:08:45,7
It was at that stage the war was beginning to have an impact on me.

52
00:08:47,25 --> 00:08:53,47
Too many had gone and had not come back too many had gone to the bottom of the ocean

53
00:08:55,06 --> 00:09:06,24
and too many had on the Burma railway. And I was beginning to think his life.

54
00:09:06,26 --> 00:09:15,33
I thought about this very deeply the other day. When I read or later in the Herald from a rabbi.

55
00:09:17,94 --> 00:09:24,51
And he said when people were being sent to the concentration camps in Germany.

56
00:09:24,52 --> 00:09:31,94
First they sent the Communists he was but he wasn't one. So why should it be. In the trade you know he wasn't one.

57
00:09:32,11 --> 00:09:37,22
So why should he care. And so it went on until they began to sing in the church people.

58
00:09:37,89 --> 00:09:48,68
And he ended up spending same and he isn't in a nutty concentration camp. And you know why.

59
00:09:51,43 --> 00:09:59,04
We were cut off from that kind of thing we have no idea what was going on with Europe.

60
00:09:59,1 --> 00:10:12,91
We didn't know that million millions had died in this life came. And perhaps lighten the impact. You know why.

61
00:10:12,93 --> 00:10:25,25
Because we were entering. On the terrible brutality of the Japanese.

62
00:10:25,27 --> 00:10:34,9
Faith you were part of the Women's Land Army in this time what. When did you join up and what prompted you to do that.

63
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:39,63
When you know in nineteen fourteen.

64
00:10:40,98 --> 00:10:46,28
Many people most people whom I knew felt I had to get up and bloody will do something

65
00:10:47,06 --> 00:10:58,42
or was it Japanese would take Australia. And I remember very well the night when I was in the city.

66
00:10:58,44 --> 00:11:11,71
And I got the ten o'clock boat her went up. And I heard what sounded like. Yes but they were deaf.

67
00:11:12,08 --> 00:11:18,69
Depth charges being dropped to destroy the Japanese submarine set in.

68
00:11:18,7 --> 00:11:23,17
Coming up and that now I see it's very very fit in my mind.

69
00:11:25,29 --> 00:11:36,59
And so the next morning I said the very next moment he landed my sister

70
00:11:36,59 --> 00:11:43,23
and I went into place where the recruitment center world.

71
00:11:43,58 --> 00:11:51,57
And I recall the officer there by the name of Mrs Johnson who says oh why do you want to go into the land you know very

72
00:11:51,57 --> 00:11:59,59
discouraging. And so we've made up our minds which sister. Kath buses to care.

73
00:12:00,78 --> 00:12:11,49
And to so I guess it's the fact that the Japanese had bought. And we were told they knew that.

74
00:12:11,66 --> 00:12:18,61
People put out and the submarine came very close to that ferry I was on.

75
00:12:20,03 --> 00:12:21,08
That helped me make up my mind

76
00:12:21,08 --> 00:12:28,68
but you see me were thinking as I was thinking we can't afford not to get into something.

77
00:12:28,7 --> 00:12:32,05
It's here it's right here in Australia.

78
00:12:32,99 --> 00:12:45,13
So to begin with the land was the cruelest of all and all I'm sure because we had to provide our own working class.

79
00:12:46,6 --> 00:12:55,79
And we've also villian close to the first twelve months and packing a suitcase with the various necessities

80
00:12:56,99 --> 00:13:08,69
and going up to Central Station and there was an army of the most elegant women all going off to work on the land.

81
00:13:08,71 --> 00:13:18,02
And it was the officer in charge. She had a uniform on she had actually. One of the forces are forgotten which one.

82
00:13:19,25 --> 00:13:23,85
Very able and beautiful home and very compassionate very loving very firm.

83
00:13:24,14 --> 00:13:28,24
So she got us all together on Central Station. And.

84
00:13:28,57 --> 00:13:36,13
Those days you had to travel while I was steam trains but you had to travel and work was if you were civilian

85
00:13:36,13 --> 00:13:39,71
and what was known as the dock boxes.

86
00:13:40,05 --> 00:13:45,66
You know that were just too long in each little compartment and you looked at each other like that.

87
00:13:46,81 --> 00:13:55,98
And of course a very wealthy were always able if not to bribe a good seat or. Get into another carriage but.

88
00:13:56,36 --> 00:14:01,2
Mainly they were kept from soldiers or people in uniform as I said so.

89
00:14:02,76 --> 00:14:11,57
I even Pickering the office said Come on girls and you blow a whistle and just in the east L.A. Going to women would.

90
00:14:11,66 --> 00:14:18,36
Most magnificent do beautifully manicured nails.

91
00:14:18,37 --> 00:14:27,29
Great make up picking up this cases and getting into the dog boxes and we set off for you. And the first year.

92
00:14:31,28 --> 00:14:40,75
We pick there twenty five of us. And we were some of the very early recruits and we got two young and he said Well.

93
00:14:40,77 --> 00:14:50,93
When we arrived from all the far was came to the station and count the mayor came with a local band

94
00:14:51,72 --> 00:15:01,08
and I've just off the train. And of course the pharmacy is for just flapping that I had never seen such a glass.

95
00:15:01,39 --> 00:15:15,29
But I think they also thought his hands take my cherries off the tree. But I have photographs of our right. S.

96
00:15:19,21 --> 00:15:22,84
Here we were taken off with right.

97
00:15:23,87 --> 00:15:34,59
Ceremony to be bedded down in the local showground in a huge pavilion with nothing other than a Catholic apparently yes

98
00:15:34,59 --> 00:15:43,9
which we had to take and fill up with straw and not another thing. Some army blankets. Fortunately the war.

99
00:15:43,93 --> 00:15:50,78
They'd installed a number of shares. So it was in the middle somewhere you see you pick in November.

100
00:15:52,28 --> 00:16:03,02
So we all went into this huge massive hole. It was the exhibition hall for the local show you see and.

101
00:16:03,04 --> 00:16:11,00
Here we were there were already women. So you all in that pavilion a space would have been a bit maybe thirty five.

102
00:16:14,01 --> 00:16:34,96
I couldn't believe what I was. You know women were looking for coaching. And then we showered and settled in. Which.

103
00:16:35,88 --> 00:16:44,6
Then we were told we have to go. To the dining room across the way like across the field. So we went over.

104
00:16:44,62 --> 00:16:53,04
And I've never had an experience like this although I spent some time in a college with my sister where we ate like in

105
00:16:53,04 --> 00:16:55,03
large groups but this was different.

106
00:16:55,38 --> 00:16:59,41
All of these people looked so different and I didn't have a bloody thing in common.

107
00:16:59,73 --> 00:17:07,72
Except to do something for the war effort. And I said. And people who are looking for I can recall.

108
00:17:09,13 --> 00:17:21,12
Who'd come from very wealthy background. When looking for time on their linen table Nick. And the second.

109
00:17:21,13 --> 00:17:23,43
It was nothing they got in the queue.

110
00:17:23,5 --> 00:17:32,74
They used pemmican they used to like for the a party each no trouble at all without exception.

111
00:17:33,36 --> 00:17:41,71
Nobody complained and I'm sure of the back of thinking of the men at the front and what they were putting up with

112
00:17:41,71 --> 00:17:49,94
and what they were going through. Nobody complained. Because who is land on a huge range of activities.

113
00:17:50,54 --> 00:17:54,00
What sort of things were you involved in it was.

114
00:17:54,02 --> 00:17:59,84
It was it may need working at young in the fruit picking all with their other activities as well.

115
00:18:00,78 --> 00:18:07,56
Now it wasn't really because when. One would be sent to where a season was ready for harvesting.

116
00:18:08,17 --> 00:18:11,59
As we were said to young. And by.

117
00:18:11,66 --> 00:18:14,91
Either way each morning the farmers would come in their trucks and pick us up

118
00:18:14,91 --> 00:18:26,4
and you see see woman getting into the trucks like workers. But we picked the cherry crop layer and then.

119
00:18:26,42 --> 00:18:30,5
We were all split a bad name would become very friendly with each other.

120
00:18:30,79 --> 00:18:37,01
Like there was a beautiful musician who played the violin and a beautiful painting.

121
00:18:37,52 --> 00:18:49,48
And these beautiful hands were used to pick the fruit. And from their. Death and.

122
00:18:50,16 --> 00:19:01,12
Together with four or six others forgotten. Were asked if we would go and harvest tomatoes and asparagus in better.

123
00:19:02,63 --> 00:19:08,59
And we were permitted a few days' leave before going to bed. Well still in civvy clothes of course.

124
00:19:08,66 --> 00:19:19,24
So we come to Sydney and we kind of blow and claimed three towns away typically cherries and we get on the train

125
00:19:19,24 --> 00:19:21,98
and go to the next fly so we would have to better.

126
00:19:22,32 --> 00:19:31,11
And that was quite an experience half and I got on the train and we set off and we were told quote.

127
00:19:31,57 --> 00:19:45,44
We would be made the matron at the railway station whose name was Mrs missing. Very close to us it was emu. Anyhow.

128
00:19:46,75 --> 00:19:56,6
We crossed the Blue Mountains and went down in the cities of the plains. As we stepped off the platform.

129
00:19:56,62 --> 00:20:18,17
A woman dressed in. Crape to a beautiful crape pink suit and. A blue hat with Fables. And. All. But it hanging loosely.

130
00:20:18,19 --> 00:20:27,34
Came up and said Welcome girls. I'm the officer Mrs missing. And.

131
00:20:27,36 --> 00:20:33,83
Anyhow she said I'm sure you're feeling hungry so we'll go to the chills. And have some lunch.

132
00:20:34,14 --> 00:20:39,26
Now I'd heard of the reputation of the Chelsea the restaurant.

133
00:20:39,28 --> 00:20:48,17
That during the war when we couldn't get everything was by coupon mate everything.

134
00:20:49,78 --> 00:20:56,15
They they could have scones and cream. The whole works.

135
00:20:56,29 --> 00:21:02,14
So they were you know stuff on the black market but she said I'll take it.

136
00:21:02,16 --> 00:21:05,53
We'll go to the Chelsea in at lunch and I thought that was lovely.

137
00:21:05,58 --> 00:21:11,63
Because you know we've been eating off these two plates for a few weeks and eating stew and what have you.

138
00:21:13,45 --> 00:21:22,37
So I thought someone. She's got a car when she's come along. And she carried law suit case for me.

139
00:21:25,59 --> 00:21:32,82
And we went to hosts trough. And there was a pile of horse having a drink. Standing there.

140
00:21:33,12 --> 00:21:40,93
Patiently waiting for us with a spring cat. And she hopped up into that spring cart very early.

141
00:21:41,11 --> 00:21:48,74
She had two little boxes one for kept to sit on and one for me to sit on. And with a beautiful pink suit and.

142
00:21:51,54 --> 00:21:57,91
Said Come on Dolly pull the horse up and off we went to the Chelsea down the Main Street.

143
00:21:59,51 --> 00:22:06,87
It was wonderful and true and we were going to be billeted Where is she says.

144
00:22:06,92 --> 00:22:15,84
Didn't I tell you what it quote is it's at Mount. Isn't it. Stewart's former residence meant nothing to me.

145
00:22:16,84 --> 00:22:23,6
I had forgotten about that I knew that was where blacks lost and went with and Jamerson

146
00:22:23,6 --> 00:22:27,62
but never thought of the steward's as early settlers the early settlers.

147
00:22:28,82 --> 00:22:34,21
Well we get into this spring cart and off we go about four miles out from town

148
00:22:35,08 --> 00:22:44,76
and up on the Hill is a huge grey castle. She turns to the magnificent driveway.

149
00:22:45,97 --> 00:22:56,07
From right from the bottom little although I. May just stick castle and asked her to succeed. She said.

150
00:22:56,11 --> 00:23:00,9
Yours is just a stupid cow so when they began to give us a street.

151
00:23:00,92 --> 00:23:14,58
She took us in to the master bedroom and said they saw you better. Already there were women there and.

152
00:23:17,48 --> 00:23:23,95
We were treated so well. Never forget it but she said in the morning girls.

153
00:23:24,16 --> 00:23:32,33
You won't be picking asparagus you need to get a little practice in bending the back. So you'll go wanted to matter.

154
00:23:32,34 --> 00:23:39,06
And there's. You have to cross the McQuarrie she said and the farmer is on the other side of the muck already.

155
00:23:40,18 --> 00:23:45,1
But there is a flying fox. Flying Fox I thought flying fox.

156
00:23:45,16 --> 00:23:49,28
Well I remembered flying foxes that had to be kept out of Africa tree said.

157
00:23:49,86 --> 00:23:57,07
Flying Fox Well we didn't ask any more questions and the next morning three of us went down the drive

158
00:23:57,07 --> 00:24:04,23
and crossed the paddock and came to the McQuarrie river and only other side was a tomato page.

159
00:24:06,27 --> 00:24:11,55
And sure enough there was a flying fox. So wait. The idea was to put your kit on your.

160
00:24:11,66 --> 00:24:14,33
Back and you put two feet on one.

161
00:24:14,36 --> 00:24:20,98
Why hang on to the end with another hand pulling the rope that takes you across the river.

162
00:24:21,59 --> 00:24:29,25
And we had to do this every morning every afternoon. So I wouldn't use the flying fox.

163
00:24:29,27 --> 00:24:35,66
And so we picked the matter say for a long time.

164
00:24:35,67 --> 00:24:45,84
The interesting thing about it was that really beautiful relationship developed between so many of the women

165
00:24:45,84 --> 00:24:54,12
and the farmers. And some of the women married married the sons of all the bachelor families.

166
00:24:54,26 --> 00:25:03,56
But if you ask me what I did to begin with. Certainly I've worked on the cabbage cutting cabbage.

167
00:25:04,15 --> 00:25:15,02
Cutting to matters and asparagus. But after all of that you see over in Iraq. January and you pick fruit.

168
00:25:16,08 --> 00:25:25,41
Not so much better. Stone fruit but whatever was there was always apples of course.

169
00:25:26,25 --> 00:25:33,09
And then when that finished the pruning of the stone tree fruit has got to be down.

170
00:25:33,31 --> 00:25:38,54
And that is really essentially a big strong man's job. But we got stuck into it.

171
00:25:39,46 --> 00:25:43,4
You know you use twenty foot lead to get to the very top of the tree

172
00:25:43,4 --> 00:25:47,78
and the tree would have to be shaped beautifully and trimmed to perfection

173
00:25:48,71 --> 00:25:58,78
and I had had some lessons in printing plant so didn't trouble me who flew much. And then after you proved we proved.

174
00:25:58,8 --> 00:26:08,89
We had to rake up the prunings have them in huge piles in between the rows of trees and then learn them.

175
00:26:09,21 --> 00:26:22,16
Well I had a beautiful boys. And he wrote poetry and he knew him. And he for the most beautiful.

176
00:26:22,18 --> 00:26:34,83
So he said well one day tomorrow we'll will you know the pruning limbs stuff we pruned. And I said you're right here.

177
00:26:35,04 --> 00:26:38,99
How do you do it he said well come them or not. Show you.

178
00:26:39,00 --> 00:26:46,3
So I'm going to and they reinforced me had a big draft horse and cart

179
00:26:47,18 --> 00:26:54,5
and what you did was for the cuttings into the car to see and the. You went along the road.

180
00:26:55,16 --> 00:27:00,61
You didn't get too much because that the danger would be the four I would get away from you.

181
00:27:00,75 --> 00:27:09,23
Well lo and behold he said have you got the idea and I said yes. OK. So he left me on my own.

182
00:27:09,75 --> 00:27:19,08
And I made the terrible mistake of taking the horse to face the wind. And so what happened.

183
00:27:19,11 --> 00:27:22,97
I had to find going nicely and everything was going beautifully you know.

184
00:27:23,44 --> 00:27:29,9
Feeling this I am with the cuttings and then I could smell him.

185
00:27:30,63 --> 00:27:37,01
And the horse's tail was on fire because the wind had blown it back over the R. and Cat.

186
00:27:37,02 --> 00:27:46,58
And fortunately I had collapsed. And I rushed to the horse and just grabbed it with my hands.

187
00:27:46,59 --> 00:27:58,49
I put the flame out and if. I've never forgotten and put it in the horses. Pretty to something for.

188
00:27:59,99 --> 00:28:06,2
It was the horse all right and well you're right horse didn't flick an upper. Most thought I was crazy.

189
00:28:06,51 --> 00:28:11,41
So after that few days later came said well if I think you may.

190
00:28:11,66 --> 00:28:17,37
You have really done a good job in many horses still there but I wondered if you'd be do a bit of irrigating now

191
00:28:17,37 --> 00:28:24,38
and I said Of course I would and I had no idea whatsoever that irrigating meant hopping in the tractor.

192
00:28:24,95 --> 00:28:30,66
And going up between the rows so that when they turned irrigation on the water.

193
00:28:30,66 --> 00:28:38,86
It just flowed on and the trees watered heavily. There are no trouble. I had no idea.

194
00:28:38,93 --> 00:28:46,37
So I turned up next morning and he had the tractor all first and tractors I called

195
00:28:47,56 --> 00:28:54,4
and he said well you turn in these things and I said will always measure affect I have and he said I'll show you.

196
00:28:54,5 --> 00:29:01,33
So he hopped up on this new day that I say yes sure.

197
00:29:01,53 --> 00:29:10,42
So I hopped up and I did those things up and back and took the tractor along and he's a lovely deep trenchers.

198
00:29:12,5 --> 00:29:19,48
He got in the car went to town to have a stroller and I took this thing into.

199
00:29:19,5 --> 00:29:28,28
The ground was just too soft and I thought the harder I accelerate the sooner I'll get out of this

200
00:29:28,28 --> 00:29:32,2
but what happened by the time came came.

201
00:29:32,22 --> 00:29:42,73
The wheels of the tractor were almost covered with the sand that I blew up in pressing the excess. Land Army.

202
00:29:42,86 --> 00:29:46,47
I had good to and. And it had better.

203
00:29:47,33 --> 00:29:53,34
There were good times because well there were times

204
00:29:53,34 --> 00:30:02,08
when there was a lot of satisfaction you so all the fruit you picked and sometimes if it were raining.

205
00:30:02,29 --> 00:30:09,36
You'd go into the cane rain came that fruit into huge containers and know that it was going directly to the troops

206
00:30:10,75 --> 00:30:14,63
and all of a. It was going to the troops all the fruit and all the vegetables.

207
00:30:15,16 --> 00:30:26,45
So there was a great sense of satisfaction. And you mentioned bad times and they were bad. But the times when.

208
00:30:27,74 --> 00:30:39,59
From Sydney someone heard right. And we've heard. And then would leave go.

209
00:30:40,36 --> 00:30:43,6
All the way to mourn about to see how many more.

210
00:30:44,61 --> 00:30:50,9
And all of those young men who man I used to go dancing with on a Friday or Saturday night

211
00:30:52,73 --> 00:31:01,24
and they weren't coming back. They were dated. And so one had to come to terms with that.

212
00:31:02,79 --> 00:31:12,33
Of course the terrible thing about war. And I realise this more and more each day. Is that it teaches you to hate.

213
00:31:14,1 --> 00:31:20,62
And to this very day. It's hard for me. To forgive the Japanese for their brutality.

214
00:31:20,64 --> 00:31:28,02
Just for the Jewish people and the soldiers Australian soldiers who went into your.

215
00:31:29,26 --> 00:31:36,15
Men in particular to forgive that you have mountains and it's nearly fifty years and this is destructive for.
