1
00:00:15,6 --> 00:00:27,07
Identification. They say this session. Thirteen. Sorry session fourteen and this is the second side.

2
00:00:27,27 --> 00:00:42,74
Coming up with fake panda invited if acacia. Well. Most history. Was Born. The youngest.

3
00:00:42,76 --> 00:00:50,64
And she was nine years old she slipped on the arm of my mother she would out into the world with all the confidence one

4
00:00:50,64 --> 00:01:09,76
could possibly. And. Like my mother she had absolutely beautiful. But we tried very hard to get her to study music.

5
00:01:10,14 --> 00:01:21,22
She wouldn't have an inch of it too impatient. But she went around and she saying in different places.

6
00:01:21,95 --> 00:01:32,25
And I remember one occasion the Polynesian club had a function in a hole in my happen. And so you must come.

7
00:01:32,76 --> 00:01:42,34
So we went along. And they were everyone started clapping one tree me. Up Front.

8
00:01:43,9 --> 00:01:58,09
And they put this roving marker of microphone. In her hand but she got the microphone like hanging behind a wife.

9
00:01:58,37 --> 00:02:14,12
And she sings. She didn't need any market ever. Ever. It was just a natural just natural force. Any.

10
00:02:14,29 --> 00:02:28,83
Now in eighty eighty. I had a yen and so I just went up to Qantas one day and I said I want to go.

11
00:02:29,84 --> 00:02:38,09
And so I went off and she came out to see me off at the airport because she

12
00:02:38,09 --> 00:02:43,14
and her husband were going to sue for they went to every year at Christmas time.

13
00:02:43,61 --> 00:02:52,44
And she said to thought of coming with you. And so I said goodbye.

14
00:02:54,14 --> 00:02:58,17
And I was I'd already been over there about four weeks and the phone rang.

15
00:02:58,51 --> 00:03:08,08
I was staying here in bed and breakfast place and the phone rang and the woman said it's your husband.

16
00:03:08,1 --> 00:03:15,98
And I was hands on hand said look I think you better come. Supporting the trouble is that Renie.

17
00:03:17,72 --> 00:03:22,43
And he said yes and here's. And she said no she hospital.

18
00:03:22,44 --> 00:03:32,9
And what had happened is that she went off to Fiji and she fell over on the dance floor one night

19
00:03:34,87 --> 00:03:40,46
and a fractured skull.

20
00:03:40,47 --> 00:03:50,22
And the superintendent of the hospital happened to be a friend who later became the prime minister.

21
00:03:50,24 --> 00:04:02,65
Who was thrown out by the present prime minister room. And here come back to you with a plan.

22
00:04:03,07 --> 00:04:10,02
She went into tonight's show and she never regained consciousness. I came back and she knew me.

23
00:04:13,01 --> 00:04:14,18
But she was in no show for.

24
00:04:14,29 --> 00:04:25,08
Six weeks and I said look it's impossible to believe they told me but I'm very good friend of ours PETER HARVEY The.

25
00:04:25,1 --> 00:04:39,85
Physicians he'd been to see. And he said you could take some of your good tapes. And play them to her with a song.

26
00:04:39,87 --> 00:04:49,96
So I went to my little type recorder. And I played her some of the songs she used. And she began to blink.

27
00:04:50,73 --> 00:04:58,48
And that was you know she really went off with. I think beautiful memories. But that was a great.

28
00:04:58,64 --> 00:05:01,81
I'm sure I can say that must have been the greatest loss.

29
00:05:02,52 --> 00:05:10,82
I've ever had in my life and that was losing really we had no one for relationship. It was just great.

30
00:05:12,67 --> 00:05:21,2
Anyhow I mean if it was a Kerry relationship. But with Reagan that was a lot of give and take and family.

31
00:05:21,49 --> 00:05:39,65
That's how it was you were the two youngest two youngest. So. I spent four nearly five weeks in that.

32
00:05:40,98 --> 00:05:49,82
And it was five weeks that I left because I was absolutely alone. I felt obliged to no one.

33
00:05:50,68 --> 00:06:00,32
And I would just I stayed in two different places and I went for the breakfasts of course I couldn't face you know.

34
00:06:00,34 --> 00:06:06,00
Two eggs and bacon and all that but so kind and generous terrible poverty.

35
00:06:07,42 --> 00:06:17,06
It was like a Third World country in many ways dreadful poverty away from Dublin. But Dublin had it.

36
00:06:17,08 --> 00:06:27,5
I found out had to take myself away from Dublin. So I went back to London and stayed overnight before I got the plane.

37
00:06:29,47 --> 00:06:38,21
You know Qantas a real bastards to deal with they didn't want to. They said yes you can come and break her trip.

38
00:06:38,23 --> 00:06:47,4
Agreement because it was a cheap plane. But she'll have to pay for it. So are said for sure.

39
00:06:47,44 --> 00:06:50,58
I have to do that because I've got to get home and had it happen

40
00:06:50,58 --> 00:06:56,46
and I said well they were under no obligation to replace it. So I point to my friend.

41
00:06:56,48 --> 00:07:01,62
The lawyer as one of the for the attorney general. Franco.

42
00:07:02,07 --> 00:07:14,22
And I said to George Look George this is happening what do I do. With your. Yes All right. Brilliant lawyer right now.

43
00:07:15,27 --> 00:07:25,29
So here I have quarters and the check arrived I think about two or three days after. But you know I was unknowing.

44
00:07:25,31 --> 00:07:48,75
To think I think that our airline would do that it was I was I mean it was one of the coasts. I thought.

45
00:07:49,9 --> 00:08:02,37
Well I suppose in the seventy's something that also greatly was dismissal of the with them. Government.

46
00:08:02,39 --> 00:08:13,95
I thought was a very exceptional person. It was the first time I think in the history of this country. That we.

47
00:08:14,29 --> 00:08:26,6
A brilliant person for a prime minister. Like someone said to me you know what a bear to flee. Cheerfully.

48
00:08:28,05 --> 00:08:36,08
Jessie Street took a deputation of upper middle class women to Canberra. To see chiefly.

49
00:08:36,1 --> 00:08:45,08
To discuss the possibility of providing a child and to poor family. That was struggling.

50
00:08:45,38 --> 00:08:49,21
That meant the money was for the children's education and so forth.

51
00:08:50,43 --> 00:09:02,78
And it was called child in down mint and this way back in like thirty. Shortly after the war. That's right and.

52
00:09:02,79 --> 00:09:16,12
Cheerfully was the prime minister because curtain. And she let this group of women up pretty well called.

53
00:09:16,13 --> 00:09:29,89
A few people like that. And they were leaving office for a minute and said now. We must do something about.

54
00:09:29,91 --> 00:09:42,86
The Aboriginal people out of the misery. And you know. You wouldn't Pakistan to marry one of them.

55
00:09:44,05 --> 00:09:50,16
So as a Labor prime minister. I was overjoyed.

56
00:09:50,56 --> 00:09:58,5
In fact I took a half a page in The Australian for an advertisement to help his campaign along.

57
00:09:59,71 --> 00:10:13,1
And I did a bit of campaigning with Margaret. But he would intelligent people who were laid back. And I was so excited.

58
00:10:13,14 --> 00:10:26,37
You know I. I could see that he we had a man who had vision certainly. I feel he should have taken a stand.

59
00:10:28,57 --> 00:10:34,15
To Marie situation. And a few other things that I felt very sore about.

60
00:10:35,56 --> 00:10:39,88
That he established the office for women's affairs.

61
00:10:40,94 --> 00:10:52,65
And that was a good beginning and he never saw women as a threat at all and to this very day.

62
00:10:55,99 --> 00:10:59,94
First of all or at a Human Rights Commission function

63
00:10:59,94 --> 00:11:08,89
or where ever it is if the thing you have for your coffee for their coffee.

64
00:11:10,66 --> 00:11:25,72
They never ever seem to expect any special treatment. No Margaret. I recall going to the north coast.

65
00:11:26,57 --> 00:11:32,65
To treat AIDS to gatherings of my mother we were having a conference there.

66
00:11:33,98 --> 00:11:39,78
And then they were closing down the conference early. And when I asked. Well.

67
00:11:39,83 --> 00:11:47,37
Goff is overtly we want to get in here tonight. So I said Oh that's good. I'll go.

68
00:11:47,39 --> 00:11:58,07
But actually it was in the morning the Sunday morning that he was speak in there and that helped prepare a lunch for.

69
00:11:58,09 --> 00:12:08,75
All labor people. Not that it's maybe like the next World Cup.

70
00:12:08,77 --> 00:12:20,12
And then I thought well I better get home because I still get to do. We tidying up for Kitty and so I thought.

71
00:12:20,14 --> 00:12:32,24
I want to go off will get me a lease. So I said Can I have a lift back of course. So we got in his plane.

72
00:12:32,89 --> 00:12:35,82
And on the way coming back.

73
00:12:35,84 --> 00:12:42,13
He came up the back with the journalists who were and myself and his staff

74
00:12:43,41 --> 00:12:51,82
and talked about the Harlan people because he'd seen so many of them there. And he said to me.

75
00:12:51,85 --> 00:12:57,75
Well you know what you should form a national council. A National Party.

76
00:12:57,79 --> 00:13:04,09
So you have to have a base to work from from for the for what is do you leave.

77
00:13:05,51 --> 00:13:09,39
And so I came home and that's what I did in fact.

78
00:13:09,41 --> 00:13:22,79
A few months later we formed the National Party for Australians are lenders. But that was what Gough could do and. So.

79
00:13:22,81 --> 00:13:29,59
Sure he was tell me which Prime Minister was that bad. He was a person.

80
00:13:30,32 --> 00:13:44,15
He didn't have that much compassion in the why that Keating. Intellect. He looked for. He didn't want to patch up.

81
00:13:44,17 --> 00:13:57,18
And things must be changing legislation and then you know. It's a mentor. In the recent couple of my friends appears.

82
00:13:57,72 --> 00:14:01,33
How do you feel about Diana going what was your opinion.

83
00:14:02,71 --> 00:14:09,84
Well I personally think that she was a damn good woman who'd grown.

84
00:14:09,86 --> 00:14:14,00
So where there was need to help and got in and helped.

85
00:14:14,29 --> 00:14:21,99
I'm continued with a high life as well who would dispute that but she managed to organize that and I said good luck.

86
00:14:22,22 --> 00:14:34,58
She's doing things. The same person said and what about Mother Teresa. And I didn't feel that way.

87
00:14:35,4 --> 00:14:42,17
Personally of course I think I was a bit because she went to a conference in Dublin when I was there.

88
00:14:42,62 --> 00:14:45,91
The last time I was there about three years ago.

89
00:14:45,93 --> 00:14:56,85
And Mary Robinson the president was very taken back to research should be there if you police to support the right to

90
00:14:56,85 --> 00:15:07,06
life and he to deprive women of the right of controlling their bodies. So you know my attitude was different.

91
00:15:07,08 --> 00:15:17,62
There and apart from which I saw her more. As a political person show she said the hungry. She administered to that.

92
00:15:18,6 --> 00:15:22,48
She taught others to do that which I thought was good.

93
00:15:22,88 --> 00:15:31,91
There's a place for charity but somewhere along the line you've got to ask why. Why this difference.

94
00:15:31,97 --> 00:15:43,43
Why there are six three. Well. And it's extreme poverty and if you carry any power as a public figure.

95
00:15:43,45 --> 00:15:58,46
You have a duty to ask why why must it be like this. And I see Carol in this society.

96
00:15:58,48 --> 00:16:08,68
A capitalist society many good things. It's very democracy. But there are a lot of things that need to be looked at.

97
00:16:08,96 --> 00:16:19,87
We have many charities in Australia. And to few who are asking why is it for if that.

98
00:16:20,29 --> 00:16:26,84
Further let this group of people must be disadvantaged. Why is it for ever.

99
00:16:26,99 --> 00:16:33,03
That that group must be discriminated against and have to work. To remove discrimination.

100
00:16:34,22 --> 00:16:37,7
And the work that goes into the charities is admirable.

101
00:16:38,06 --> 00:16:46,81
But we should country like Australia make sure that that kind of work. To removing the cause.

102
00:16:48,82 --> 00:16:59,6
So there is a need for charities but there's also a need to remove the causes of poverty disadvantage.

103
00:16:59,62 --> 00:17:05,73
So this is going on recently and I had been thinking a lot about this

104
00:17:07,72 --> 00:17:24,39
and said just to come back to the matter of the commission. I thought. It's a good. I felt. Right. Fulfillment.

105
00:17:24,4 --> 00:17:33,77
It was given people a chance to begin a new life. We couldn't move in and help them. To think.

106
00:17:34,84 --> 00:17:41,03
To perhaps change the thinking or their attitudes or anything like that. That's quite true.

107
00:17:43,24 --> 00:17:53,51
But if it is some small why we help them to ask our. It may have helped. But it also gave children.

108
00:17:53,53 --> 00:18:06,1
A beginning in life that they may not have. Any has so much the housing market with the Housing Commission. It was.

109
00:18:06,12 --> 00:18:14,34
If you challenge. And satisfy. I think you leave it. They sure will.
