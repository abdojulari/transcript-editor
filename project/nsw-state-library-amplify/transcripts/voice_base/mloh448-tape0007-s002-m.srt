1
00:00:06,1 --> 00:00:31,67
She was strange. One of the bitch. We had a guy again. Picture. Come back from Canada. Why bring. She was still.

2
00:00:34,96 --> 00:01:12,3
The friend who are here. The other guy got off the train. Home. It's what. By the time I got there was two hours.

3
00:01:14,38 --> 00:01:39,76
I was there I could see that was Gerry I never checked. My phrase. Yes. That. Anyway. But I came back. And.

4
00:01:48,99 --> 00:02:12,77
Was like that doesn't matter. Makes you sound like what you do. Does a strike.

5
00:02:13,1 --> 00:02:22,28
She is a natural right she spots I will not appear again that on his part he was a silly little joint.

6
00:02:27,61 --> 00:02:29,41
And there was almost this tiny silence

7
00:02:29,41 --> 00:02:40,12
when I thought I was good that it wasn't so much that the good looking guy was a new face

8
00:02:41,05 --> 00:02:44,32
and your face group that all knew each other.

9
00:02:44,56 --> 00:02:48,95
This was a guy and I signed on you not to say they were

10
00:02:48,95 --> 00:02:58,65
and he was his new fries because I am in this corner that suddenly think that it was something.

11
00:02:58,76 --> 00:03:02,21
They were looking at those doing this.

12
00:03:02,28 --> 00:03:10,11
It was all done boilers the whole thing was a glance at last of those few seconds longer still there.

13
00:03:10,83 --> 00:03:26,56
But that's as far as Little Guy one rushed me rushed into it as far as I would like to see straight. I said sure.

14
00:03:26,83 --> 00:03:44,92
I was told it was a question. And I was actually at my place because all I was sign is him. He said.

15
00:03:44,96 --> 00:03:56,73
I just couldn't believe that there were so many young any new fears I had seen so many times in one place once

16
00:03:56,73 --> 00:04:06,85
and to never say never. And leave it. When that shot was my areas and she was terribly sympathetic.

17
00:04:07,65 --> 00:04:09,82
And so I was great

18
00:04:10,14 --> 00:04:23,99
and she makes me up so full of life draws looked like a shot until I got this to the bike up the tricky stuff trick.

19
00:04:26,12 --> 00:04:27,05
Was the little.

20
00:04:28,02 --> 00:04:42,31
They were getting It was one of the last of the let down of the things that it was just dreadful little bitch strange

21
00:04:42,31 --> 00:04:49,89
carries that she lived across an alley where her living room bedroom window looks tried in the living room.

22
00:04:49,92 --> 00:04:58,34
One of the papers is the time of the flight and she's trying to spoil what.

23
00:05:00,16 --> 00:05:07,6
Yet she began the rush like her money selling this girl the type of tips that she had to tip madly in to be sure what

24
00:05:08,12 --> 00:05:21,25
it was like there which obviously you can't assume for thought that it was a drink. You're out so she was never.

25
00:05:22,35 --> 00:05:28,63
You know she was really trying to get something on him to roulette.

26
00:05:29,28 --> 00:05:44,11
Which was nothing never even though they were there to see if the their stride was going all strong this time I was

27
00:05:44,11 --> 00:05:46,4
alone but it was right up.

28
00:05:46,45 --> 00:05:55,64
It was more than it was more offices where it's the offices of his drivers drivers lucky

29
00:05:55,64 --> 00:06:14,65
and every room in the mine for her to go. This life with light is a real. To try to Woodlands of that very public site.

30
00:06:20,8 --> 00:06:33,87
Here. Have the finest metal. Guy the guy.

31
00:06:42,6 --> 00:07:05,79
Could see and even that was not actually my friend of mine it was Saturday morning show me what you got there.

32
00:07:06,28 --> 00:07:32,93
Yeah there was a store any local places like the Red Sea ship just the way that you guys used to sit by the bar.

33
00:07:37,8 --> 00:07:39,84
That still existed if she was sympathetic

34
00:07:45,35 --> 00:08:01,35
but certainly had her fall guy that one's name that was there long before the race was the one.

35
00:08:03,25 --> 00:08:09,15
Well yeah yeah yeah yeah.

36
00:08:10,36 --> 00:08:28,39
Very quickly but that child was the guy who is just this is a long sixty's that was horrified that

37
00:08:28,39 --> 00:08:41,69
when you had the wife if you didn't buy the bill they said she'll get three pack here. If you didn't know his wife.

38
00:08:44,1 --> 00:08:59,25
I had to go to. The same what was the last from there.

39
00:09:02,81 --> 00:09:24,16
But there were two of the Gulf Coast but they were Dutch like this is the paradox of East St The visual.

40
00:09:25,97 --> 00:09:34,99
The court of strife a little facts a way to give these here

41
00:09:37,21 --> 00:09:47,68
and there in the eyes of those who would be sitting in their shoes and Margaret

42
00:09:47,71 --> 00:10:10,16
and she was understanding simplicity so vast a twit pic. It's a little. Actually that's your life. But who was the.

43
00:10:34,68 --> 00:11:55,35
One thing. My. Right there in the church is doing. I'm giving you a new life reference to carry your day here.

44
00:11:55,91 --> 00:12:23,14
On there that's not that's not the only one. Work on figuring. It is a city are not one. Cars. Every mile.

45
00:12:27,12 --> 00:12:38,41
I want to say that if anybody did it.

46
00:12:45,8 --> 00:12:59,38
You had a broad approach to do and get back to life and he was with only twenty six.

47
00:12:59,43 --> 00:13:19,65
Let me read what he can lose back so that there is a different sixty three pretty.

48
00:13:20,24 --> 00:13:53,13
And he's a very handsome which he will see the end of a trial run for their white for each of them. There.

49
00:13:53,74 --> 00:14:12,22
If one of us got sick of this straight. It's strange because Charles de Gys and I just walked out of the system.

50
00:14:12,82 --> 00:14:23,94
In the sixty's. He was shaking his hand was that attack. Of course because it was a fright or. Anyway.

51
00:14:24,17 --> 00:14:36,72
It was a very harsh friendship and I was getting a lot of this and. It was the I was saying it was much more.

52
00:14:36,82 --> 00:14:42,49
The old days that he came up.

53
00:14:42,55 --> 00:14:53,65
One of the stories with the long standing in the bow look at the back of the heel somebody shoe

54
00:14:53,65 --> 00:15:06,57
and if you saw a very foreign norm you saw a lot of this long drawn down the center of the back of the hill.

55
00:15:07,08 --> 00:15:16,04
That was a guy. And he laughed and he told the story. Whatever sort to this day or this or that one. And this here.

56
00:15:16,13 --> 00:15:29,54
I never saw read that there was one in the kind of which possibly was. Closest to the red. That the person thought.

57
00:15:32,29 --> 00:15:43,22
But then you know where it was then because it was. It seems to be feeling what the big thing was he was.

58
00:15:43,47 --> 00:15:53,04
And apparently everybody knew these kids at school we never knew it was well this is the fifty's the sixty's.

59
00:15:53,52 --> 00:16:02,51
My friend of mine with their parents had their limits and got straight out of school. They never were possible.

60
00:16:03,86 --> 00:16:17,18
The British set up here. They had the other one of the depicted in this very nicely. To go with the rights.

61
00:16:19,65 --> 00:16:20,52
In his forty's.

62
00:16:21,47 --> 00:16:27,8
And he's biased on what and I know you often but not to trip around

63
00:16:33,78 --> 00:16:40,28
and he said places where you are night you guys live liars.

64
00:16:44,48 --> 00:16:53,28
Is right in this respect was not just that I run the parish.

65
00:16:54,95 --> 00:17:05,77
And he came up with this prize he set up in the path of the back here pushing back here is that for.

66
00:17:07,48 --> 00:17:09,51
You never say never.

67
00:17:10,73 --> 00:17:26,91
Is that any of the signals the station up to down except fire the view of Dr Carson just broader colors Ridge.

68
00:17:30,5 --> 00:17:41,51
Where in casual flyers with the only way he didn't get the top and bottom line motherboard sure.

69
00:17:45,46 --> 00:18:02,96
Chris not to show it wasn't a cane and it was White Castle. They want outside which was one of the material was Muslim.

70
00:18:04,75 --> 00:18:28,8
Time was a very strong and it had a blast effect. And this is what I was very much. Seeing which I'm sure. It was.

71
00:18:36,41 --> 00:18:49,56
Which. If you write.

72
00:19:07,03 --> 00:19:35,58
It was very very amateurish you want physical we didn't go very far short of luck and he wanted to have a go.

73
00:19:38,39 --> 00:19:57,86
And there was just priority here. Working or of livelihood living building that day it was originally electricity.

74
00:20:05,86 --> 00:20:16,05
Many challenges minister I'd feel just as separate which is the city. And I took out of the building.

75
00:20:16,79 --> 00:20:17,65
One of the in the head.

76
00:20:17,87 --> 00:20:37,77
This is just a live shot office mean only one you manage to see how to connect to the fight to save lives that bosses

77
00:20:37,96 --> 00:20:38,34
lunch.

78
00:20:42,86 --> 00:21:00,12
And one dive with life it's like they are in the church where I was only back towards the very crowded so I think I had

79
00:21:00,12 --> 00:21:11,11
the faintest idea that just there is no reason to measure and.

80
00:21:12,43 --> 00:21:22,63
Anyway just taking the song to live the way out of that was right there. We died energy and that's it.

81
00:21:22,64 --> 00:21:48,24
Yes it was tight. So there was a lark so I was wearing white snow white and on this beautiful sunny day to six.

82
00:21:53,35 --> 00:22:05,22
I didn't get there but it led to the first shots I really feel that I would rather listen. To enjoy.

83
00:22:10,81 --> 00:22:46,00
It just go along with that that little while I guess. I picked up. Very tight. Right there. And there was a try once.

84
00:22:48,65 --> 00:23:22,66
Which was great. But I was enjoying. These rights. There. And. We picked up for their life one day.

85
00:23:25,38 --> 00:23:38,29
That we were surprised the place. Just that she's.

86
00:23:42,48 --> 00:24:08,53
And they were very friendly and down the time about what this was at the time on the side. But ya know. Actually there.

87
00:24:08,56 --> 00:24:34,18
Look. They brought that up in the way this is the thing is with the letter they are fully aware that this.

88
00:24:35,9 --> 00:24:39,18
Mary would have been court.

89
00:24:42,56 --> 00:24:56,28
Which can give me cameras that were just for me to give evidence against the first victim

90
00:24:59,59 --> 00:25:08,96
and this is what went to the Christmas tree back to the court in the act.

91
00:25:09,88 --> 00:25:23,35
Somehow or other privacy or most blacked out of the Black their date is it's a very cloudy.

92
00:25:24,37 --> 00:25:37,18
If you're there that it's very difficult there for how they got themselves it was it so that she could go

93
00:25:37,41 --> 00:25:49,54
or rather what it was those telling the story. Like the civilian crew it was.

94
00:25:50,69 --> 00:25:59,67
And they had no American officer really Mauritania.

95
00:26:03,38 --> 00:26:11,59
And there finished up in front of the British doctor who took horrible exception to this

96
00:26:11,77 --> 00:26:18,63
and beat them with a carrier is this we have with this character not as a stick.

97
00:26:19,72 --> 00:26:32,16
And he lost his temper at the it's just. It's very well written. That it's just horrible. Yes.

98
00:26:33,42 --> 00:26:43,73
This man is the law of their story. I think very rightly that's the legislative precept of a different way. To feel.

99
00:26:44,18 --> 00:27:02,04
He was in this to do this to this child. Not sure what it was that they are. And the chaplain has only offices.

100
00:27:05,34 --> 00:27:19,6
But if they still effect all his life for a while then he was in disgrace. Which was just.

101
00:27:20,06 --> 00:27:31,1
He got caught and he was given the full military tree Court-Martial open and drummed out

102
00:27:31,1 --> 00:27:40,61
and drowned out his very dramatic ration that's literally what the entire station which lasted in front of their toilet

103
00:27:40,61 --> 00:27:41,93
through your hands of me.

104
00:27:42,06 --> 00:27:51,23
Drums were literally rolled and the commanding officer read out the child read out the findings of the four March

105
00:27:51,23 --> 00:28:00,7
and the sentence which was to be discharged dishonorably from the service or stripped of all right.

106
00:28:00,75 --> 00:28:02,99
Which point he goes for added to.

107
00:28:19,39 --> 00:28:47,91
This is why there was such an eye out for him which is always been a strong and he was right all right.

108
00:28:49,72 --> 00:30:01,54
As a result of his volunteer. State for what they were getting off the court and I go on to the fore.

109
00:32:03,77 --> 00:33:34,42
Yes but that's the way. That they're on. Guys who want to market for others that are there for nearly every guy so.

110
00:33:43,76 --> 00:34:09,3
For us. It's that. Has nothing on it. That's the way to get the records.

111
00:34:13,93 --> 00:34:32,35
That would be quite interesting for you guys of the night he had. Just pretty things that you like.

112
00:34:37,82 --> 00:34:46,39
As long as you pointed out strongly that you had the right. And that you got something out.

113
00:34:46,95 --> 00:35:00,71
He was afraid you were clear. But did the other thing. And you touched on it.

114
00:35:01,48 --> 00:35:20,18
We're coming back to early to tell the story. But I think that probably exists here.

115
00:35:22,03 --> 00:35:31,28
And it's a very difficult one but do you think that. What's this with the sort of sexual behavior.

116
00:35:31,54 --> 00:35:47,12
Has changed in the sense I mean it's always had a reputation of a hit experience that might be true to anything.

117
00:35:50,28 --> 00:36:18,54
But well I didn't really want to write your. I ended up with a very short but. No I think the right.

118
00:36:22,96 --> 00:36:51,93
That is the right thing that I think just because I was the person.

119
00:37:06,23 --> 00:37:30,92
Why you had to get out because because of the first couple Americans.

120
00:37:34,37 --> 00:38:13,73
This kind of compatibility through that process what did you want to turn it off work. Very very. Personal. Story.

121
00:38:16,81 --> 00:38:28,13
Just that. He just could not do anything else.

122
00:38:28,51 --> 00:38:44,06
I think that between my legs

123
00:38:45,45 --> 00:40:00,96
and it was thirty three joining us with a very bright twenty six years ago the right stuff to reject that rejected him

124
00:40:00,96 --> 00:40:06,22
because he couldn't.
