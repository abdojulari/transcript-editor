1
00:00:09,39 --> 00:00:14,29
You go. So by the.

2
00:00:14,31 --> 00:00:20,67
So seven the losses in the
ambulance. I was about 25.

3
00:00:21,78 --> 00:00:28,74
But i was able to do it with. The. Yes.

4
00:00:29,01 --> 00:00:35,40
Yes it was just a macfarlane m-c.

5
00:00:35,68 --> 00:00:42,37
If they are a any joes. Jamie.

6
00:00:42,39 --> 00:00:48,33
If you go oh my name is jan i worked here
during the aquarius testable for the

7
00:00:48,33 --> 00:00:52,19
aquarius sun shine and went away for
five years and then i came back

8
00:00:52,19 --> 00:00:57,79
and had children and haven't really gone
anywhere. I now manage a local business.

9
00:00:57,81 --> 00:00:59,13
My name's jay

10
00:00:59,13 --> 00:01:05,36
and i also worked on
the aquarius festival.

11
00:01:07,29 --> 00:01:13,54
At the end of the first lie to run away
as far as i could somehow ended up back

12
00:01:13,54 --> 00:01:13,89
here again

13
00:01:13,89 --> 00:01:21,31
and i have my own business within
the terms of the original stories

14
00:01:22,84 --> 00:01:29,05
you came early the truth the
whole truth the truth is i know

15
00:01:29,98 --> 00:01:32,81
you know that but i can't.

16
00:01:37,14 --> 00:01:42,04
Write accidentally accidentally if
things are really accidents anymore

17
00:01:42,04 --> 00:01:45,10
and i don't know if that's the case but.

18
00:01:45,52 --> 00:01:51,43
I had already been in north queensland
from about 18 months after dropping out of

19
00:01:51,43 --> 00:01:56,31
sydney and came back to sydney because
at first when you leave the city.

20
00:01:56,49 --> 00:01:59,40
You don't know how to survive really.

21
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,95
And my skills were coming quite slowly

22
00:02:01,95 --> 00:02:05,84
and so i had to do a couple of forays
back to the city and on one of them.

23
00:02:05,87 --> 00:02:10,38
I ran into my friend precious who
said. We're going to nimbin course.

24
00:02:10,72 --> 00:02:12,15
For you know what for.

25
00:02:13,37 --> 00:02:17,01
So he explained about the festival and
what was going to likely to happen

26
00:02:17,01 --> 00:02:22,38
and we want to come and work i was also
in sydney with a friend of mine who deal.

27
00:02:22,40 --> 00:02:26,92
And so we said yes and we
again went back to queensland

28
00:02:26,92 --> 00:02:35,01
and then came down specially to work
on the first of all in the january.

29
00:02:35,86 --> 00:02:42,52
Well we were very idealistic then
probably idealistic as well as fairly

30
00:02:42,52 --> 00:02:46,94
footloose and fancy free. You know
if something sounds exciting.

31
00:02:47,64 --> 00:02:50,95
Because we weren't employed.

32
00:02:50,97 --> 00:02:52,16
We could just go there

33
00:02:53,57 --> 00:03:00,13
and fairly feel a sense both in those
days to a lot of courage around.

34
00:03:00,96 --> 00:03:06,46
Well i had just returned home from
india and i was in a spot of trouble.

35
00:03:06,75 --> 00:03:10,68
I suppose you could say and it
was a way out and i had friends

36
00:03:10,68 --> 00:03:16,87
that were living here and so i
disappeared and made myself very scarce.

37
00:03:16,89 --> 00:03:22,43
I wasn't do you know. So.

38
00:03:22,45 --> 00:03:27,97
So i came here and moved into a
band with a number of people.

39
00:03:28,11 --> 00:03:29,17
Jay being one of them

40
00:03:29,17 --> 00:03:33,40
and we worked on setting up the rainbow
cafe which was really good fun.

41
00:03:33,44 --> 00:03:36,10
We did used to spend a lot of
time. Cuddling one another.

42
00:03:36,10 --> 00:03:38,63
You know playing your
cooking and cuddling yes.

43
00:03:38,80 --> 00:03:42,85
High priorities was one of the biggest
features of the festival was the amount of

44
00:03:42,85 --> 00:03:46,60
cuddling that people did it was
definitely in the days of flower power.

45
00:03:47,26 --> 00:03:52,35
And mount of life solution we went to
lasting each other because everybody would

46
00:03:52,35 --> 00:03:55,31
catch you out thing

47
00:03:55,31 --> 00:03:59,93
and i really really like well i do it
for the truck to come in from broome.

48
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,09
And the truck driver who was a little bit.

49
00:04:03,75 --> 00:04:06,81
Slow used to call out in
the middle of the street.

50
00:04:06,83 --> 00:04:11,33
I've got to go running

51
00:04:11,33 --> 00:04:15,75
but everyone would be infected again like
having days i dribbled all over india

52
00:04:15,75 --> 00:04:16,83
and never caught me

53
00:04:16,83 --> 00:04:20,61
and i couldn't believe it they would
be virtually jumping off the air.

54
00:04:20,67 --> 00:04:27,13
But i mean really. They were going to
know them before they were airbrushes

55
00:04:27,14 --> 00:04:31,30
and you know. Yeah there
were then yeah with many.

56
00:04:31,98 --> 00:04:36,96
Funky i think you know. You know.

57
00:04:38,52 --> 00:04:42,48
Well everyone was very into hair which
you boys was a terrible example.

58
00:04:43,03 --> 00:04:44,93
But there was a great deal of fun.

59
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:48,26
There was a lot of lovely
sharing lots of campfires

60
00:04:48,26 --> 00:04:54,14
and a lot heaping usually can be management
was a great film was really good

61
00:04:54,14 --> 00:04:57,51
because most of us came out of
a nuclear family isolation.

62
00:04:57,69 --> 00:04:59,64
So this was where it was really.

63
00:05:00,05 --> 00:05:01,54
And it was around the time

64
00:05:01,54 --> 00:05:06,05
when our bid was really really being
discovered on a large scale with young people

65
00:05:06,05 --> 00:05:09,40
and so there was an enormous amount
of heart opening and people thought

66
00:05:09,40 --> 00:05:11,84
that this was like the best
thing that it ever happened

67
00:05:11,84 --> 00:05:14,54
and turned in i think a lot
of people have said to me

68
00:05:14,54 --> 00:05:18,97
that it was a turning point in their lives
and that their attitudes changed at

69
00:05:18,97 --> 00:05:22,65
that point in time a massively
formulated new attitude

70
00:05:22,65 --> 00:05:27,66
that maybe they have used as a basis for
how they've conducted themselves from here

71
00:05:27,66 --> 00:05:31,64
on in.

72
00:05:33,03 --> 00:05:38,09
A lot of groups a lot of things
done in circles a lot of sharing.

73
00:05:38,86 --> 00:05:42,87
I think also taking mushrooms
together and working stories.

74
00:05:43,17 --> 00:05:45,20
Tellings lots of story telling and

75
00:05:45,20 --> 00:05:50,27
and finding value in your own story which
i think what's so great about what you're

76
00:05:50,27 --> 00:05:54,79
doing too because it does it gives value
to people's lives to hear their own

77
00:05:54,79 --> 00:05:59,92
stories and it also gives value to your
life when you stop and look at why you do.

78
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,65
Things or not.

79
00:06:03,45 --> 00:06:10,29
Makes a special focus
there is great stuff.

80
00:06:11,39 --> 00:06:13,16
I am very much.

81
00:06:14,27 --> 00:06:18,37
And there were a lot of evenings held at
the rainbow cafe were with people who were

82
00:06:18,37 --> 00:06:21,28
involved in the setting up of the
festival who would get up and sing

83
00:06:21,28 --> 00:06:25,44
and encourage others to sing so there was
a lot of that sort of group sharing that.

84
00:06:25,55 --> 00:06:27,97
Maybe people hadn't really experienced

85
00:06:27,97 --> 00:06:31,34
that before us day said we came out
of news to families i mean you know.

86
00:06:32,57 --> 00:06:35,78
Obviously a lot of people had experienced
before they came here but by

87
00:06:35,78 --> 00:06:39,55
and large i think we were city people
with very little experience of

88
00:06:39,55 --> 00:06:43,00
that extended sharing we had maybe
community households in sydney

89
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:45,67
but you didn't tend to meet him
really large groups of people

90
00:06:46,65 --> 00:06:50,84
and doug was a big part of it to a lot
of people getting stoned together

91
00:06:50,84 --> 00:06:52,32
and taking mushrooms and.

92
00:06:52,88 --> 00:06:57,77
I suppose mind expansion in a
sense before it became dreary

93
00:06:57,77 --> 00:07:00,96
and i say it was a real
space where you could play.

94
00:07:01,11 --> 00:07:05,70
Yeah you know because it was like revisiting
childhood we've often talked about

95
00:07:05,70 --> 00:07:12,08
this and realize the value there
was great. Worth in that because.

96
00:07:13,22 --> 00:07:15,62
We did have that we took
that time and we were given

97
00:07:15,62 --> 00:07:20,09
that time just to reconnect with all
our friends over a period of months

98
00:07:20,09 --> 00:07:23,99
and basically we just played
we have the best fun.

99
00:07:24,01 --> 00:07:28,97
Even as well as learn a yeah we will learn
new skills because we saw the rainbow.

100
00:07:29,44 --> 00:07:33,37
We set up the craft center and then i went

101
00:07:33,37 --> 00:07:37,54
and worked on the offset printing press
which i'd never considered before you know

102
00:07:37,54 --> 00:07:43,56
and i had a rude comment actually
when we were paid a name

103
00:07:43,56 --> 00:07:48,48
and dollar a day which is just to
print the money. If you'd been good.

104
00:07:49,59 --> 00:07:52,56
Even if i could base
everybody enough food.

105
00:07:52,70 --> 00:07:56,29
I never one day buying enough
to defeat 15 pino online to us

106
00:07:56,29 --> 00:07:59,79
and right now they're to spread dollars
and i thought you know you've got a gold.

107
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:01,78
Today for working on the festival.

108
00:08:01,80 --> 00:08:03,04
Yeah but we printed

109
00:08:05,48 --> 00:08:10,15
and you know i don't even have one i want
you know michael was asking the day.

110
00:08:10,18 --> 00:08:14,66
Who's got it. Oh i've never even
heard of them lose god and him and.

111
00:08:14,68 --> 00:08:16,86
We never even got to keep
some you know i mean

112
00:08:16,86 --> 00:08:20,68
that for the money we had we had no
social no work no you're actually really

113
00:08:20,68 --> 00:08:21,75
and we had no drugs.

114
00:08:21,87 --> 00:08:24,57
So you know a dollar a
day was really vital

115
00:08:25,29 --> 00:08:29,48
and so you never got to keep
it you know living. One up.

116
00:08:29,63 --> 00:08:34,06
So we had a truck a big truck that we got
to brisbane in and bought by you know

117
00:08:34,06 --> 00:08:35,71
but you know when the market. Yeah.

118
00:08:36,37 --> 00:08:37,91
So that was a big adventure

119
00:08:37,91 --> 00:08:42,49
that a number of the said go with the truckie
whose name is harry who had grown up

120
00:08:42,49 --> 00:08:43,47
in an old people's home

121
00:08:43,47 --> 00:08:47,71
and used to tell the most amazing stories
he was very old man himself so he was a

122
00:08:47,71 --> 00:08:49,53
young man but he talked
like a really old man

123
00:08:49,53 --> 00:08:52,55
and he would talk literally
from the moment you left him

124
00:08:52,55 --> 00:08:54,72
and tell them until we got to
prison and all the way back.

125
00:08:54,92 --> 00:08:59,97
So we were jockey for position.

126
00:09:01,33 --> 00:09:02,65
And we talked frightfully slow.

127
00:09:02,87 --> 00:09:03,28
You know

128
00:09:03,28 --> 00:09:10,58
and if he was only had no courage
to me in this i looked under.

129
00:09:10,60 --> 00:09:16,69
God i think one of them just died the other
day a man named dudley who was a fairly

130
00:09:16,69 --> 00:09:21,35
old man and we think he was in and roger
the man that runs you know i mean he's.

131
00:09:21,64 --> 00:09:23,55
You know no no no no no.

132
00:09:23,58 --> 00:09:25,33
And i don't live in an
old man with white hair

133
00:09:25,33 --> 00:09:29,46
that lived over time
you know you know and.

134
00:09:29,48 --> 00:09:31,55
Roger came after the first time

135
00:09:31,55 --> 00:09:38,54
and he loosened back you know he started
you know he started the craft he just made

136
00:09:38,55 --> 00:09:45,54
you. Great. So.

137
00:09:46,62 --> 00:09:48,52
Well by the time the festival came around.

138
00:09:48,79 --> 00:09:54,84
We had established quite a strong bond
between people considering how many people

139
00:09:54,84 --> 00:09:56,46
worked on the setting up and i think

140
00:09:56,46 --> 00:09:59,71
that the arguments were there in munich
really there was a pretty good feeling

141
00:09:59,71 --> 00:10:03,44
among. Them. It was a feeling
like an extended family the band

142
00:10:03,44 --> 00:10:06,93
that we lived in i guess there would
have been 15 maybe even sometimes more

143
00:10:06,93 --> 00:10:11,35
something like around here surrounding the
barn there were little tiny pig sheds

144
00:10:11,35 --> 00:10:15,13
and old cow bales which we
had all turned into a home

145
00:10:15,13 --> 00:10:17,21
and people had put up tents and things.

146
00:10:17,59 --> 00:10:18,21
And so

147
00:10:18,21 --> 00:10:22,10
that was just one portion of it now a lot
of i thought i was it later called the

148
00:10:22,10 --> 00:10:25,98
magic circle. Jill and i made
were given the job of sewing.

149
00:10:27,26 --> 00:10:31,86
A dozen i think tepees out of canvas
for the first foundation which we did

150
00:10:31,86 --> 00:10:34,84
and for doing that we were
able to keep one each.

151
00:10:34,90 --> 00:10:38,89
And we set up done in the magic circle
we actually moved out of this house

152
00:10:38,89 --> 00:10:40,01
that we started in

153
00:10:40,84 --> 00:10:44,71
and so there are lots of you know
looked into alternate housing

154
00:10:44,71 --> 00:10:48,62
and lots of alternate healing.

155
00:10:48,64 --> 00:10:53,29
So we ran in as although not in a hollow
tree down in the paddock down here

156
00:10:53,29 --> 00:10:55,66
and they went they have
moved away from here.

157
00:10:55,77 --> 00:10:59,77
They've gone to live in bali and england
and she eventually started the birth

158
00:10:59,77 --> 00:11:00,88
and beyond here in them

159
00:11:00,88 --> 00:11:06,32
and their beginnings were as
acupuncturists in this hollow tree.

160
00:11:09,15 --> 00:11:10,94
Are you fairly. Yeah very close

161
00:11:10,94 --> 00:11:14,45
and you get most of the time you know
it makes you know mostly naked and

162
00:11:15,14 --> 00:11:19,14
and loaded like everything.

163
00:11:20,92 --> 00:11:22,29
Yeah it will never come again.

164
00:11:22,70 --> 00:11:27,32
No i don't even the children who i see in
the street who are trying to recreate it

165
00:11:27,32 --> 00:11:31,02
through their dress and and
maybe some of their ideals.

166
00:11:31,12 --> 00:11:33,92
I don't think it can ever be like

167
00:11:33,92 --> 00:11:38,62
that again because there's a
certain innocence is lost. Now.

168
00:11:39,48 --> 00:11:45,40
That we had. Yeah i mean surely
i hope for the children.

169
00:11:45,41 --> 00:11:49,49
I do as well i think it's dreadful. I
feel at that point in our lives and.

170
00:11:49,98 --> 00:11:53,46
We were very optimistic
and there was a hope

171
00:11:53,46 --> 00:11:57,58
that things would get better because
it was as i said the flower power days

172
00:11:57,58 --> 00:11:59,95
and people were ultimately optimists.

173
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,26
That society would as we knew
it would break down and out of

174
00:12:03,26 --> 00:12:04,40
that would come a new order

175
00:12:04,40 --> 00:12:07,63
and possibly a much better
attitude towards the planet

176
00:12:07,63 --> 00:12:10,82
and towards one another
as people and in england.

177
00:12:12,31 --> 00:12:19,13
I should say that i won't say that
i won't say it's to. The work.

178
00:12:20,65 --> 00:12:23,37
I do. There is there's a heap. You know.

179
00:12:24,01 --> 00:12:28,64
And i just think we're a bit slow on the
uptake i'm just seeing a great need in

180
00:12:28,64 --> 00:12:33,25
nimbin not so much now for the tourism
which people have been really focusing on

181
00:12:33,25 --> 00:12:37,84
but for the children things for the
children to do focus is for them

182
00:12:37,84 --> 00:12:43,48
and fun for them because they are on a dance
studio down the hill in the showground

183
00:12:43,48 --> 00:12:45,87
and. We have a great time together

184
00:12:46,72 --> 00:12:52,04
and i'd say about 150 children passed
through there a week if not more.

185
00:12:52,25 --> 00:12:57,74
Maybe pre-school class and swimmers
and that's from too used to 16.

186
00:12:59,28 --> 00:13:02,97
We have with.

187
00:13:05,49 --> 00:13:11,86
I would say so you know you know. Yeah yeah
yeah i feel that there's a lot of well.

188
00:13:11,88 --> 00:13:17,25
Reticence about celebrating aquarius in a
state the town is in which is sad because

189
00:13:18,43 --> 00:13:21,73
it's such a worry to most of the
people that live here that.

190
00:13:22,32 --> 00:13:26,87
Feel helpless because we basically
have this tenant of leniency.

191
00:13:27,11 --> 00:13:31,37
Tolerance is sort of like our cameras
and it always has been since the days

192
00:13:31,37 --> 00:13:34,78
when we first came here because and
if you think about the old settlers

193
00:13:34,78 --> 00:13:37,38
that lived here in this
very quiet rural area

194
00:13:37,38 --> 00:13:41,47
and a bunch of crazy hippies with the bum
hanging out their trousers literally

195
00:13:41,47 --> 00:13:44,38
moved in on them and they
were very tolerant of us

196
00:13:44,38 --> 00:13:48,27
and a lot of those people have stayed
and have become longtime residents

197
00:13:48,27 --> 00:13:51,43
and have a good relationship with
the old residents in the town

198
00:13:51,43 --> 00:13:55,38
but the new young kids that
are or the new wave of people

199
00:13:55,38 --> 00:13:56,32
that have moved into them

200
00:13:56,32 --> 00:13:59,78
and with the arts hang out of their trousers
who are using drugs and selling them.

201
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,75
Straight those old residents really out
there terrified at making them worry

202
00:14:05,75 --> 00:14:09,16
that and knowledge about in their
bed at night and wonder whether

203
00:14:09,16 --> 00:14:11,18
or not the streets safe
and that's not nice.

204
00:14:11,35 --> 00:14:13,80
I mean that's our tolerance gone haywire.

205
00:14:14,21 --> 00:14:16,13
But basically we don't
know what to do about it.

206
00:14:16,16 --> 00:14:20,80
I certainly don't know anything that's been
even gender today. Doesn't sound right.

207
00:14:20,98 --> 00:14:23,32
Like the police coming in dealing
with it was cutting them all off

208
00:14:23,32 --> 00:14:26,98
and you think well where are they going
to go you know what can you do for them

209
00:14:26,98 --> 00:14:31,35
about that. I mean they come here because
of the time and you don't you know.

210
00:14:31,69 --> 00:14:33,67
That it's it's kind of turned against us.

211
00:14:33,76 --> 00:14:37,56
Really you know which is very sad and
that's i think it's sad altogether is

212
00:14:37,56 --> 00:14:41,40
that lack of loss of innocence because
and what the outcome of that.

213
00:14:41,50 --> 00:14:44,24
Well again i could come back to.

214
00:14:45,64 --> 00:14:49,41
A focus on facilities for these
people if they're going to be here.

215
00:14:49,50 --> 00:14:52,85
Then we need to be able to deal
with in some way that helps

216
00:14:54,39 --> 00:14:58,48
and not just cut them out further
so when you gets harder and harder.

217
00:14:58,84 --> 00:15:02,33
Maybe a million creative approach
to it but once again you know

218
00:15:02,33 --> 00:15:07,64
that would take some body of responsible
people to take down and funding

219
00:15:07,64 --> 00:15:11,49
and say well. You know really funding.

220
00:15:11,54 --> 00:15:18,32
You know because we're not much richer
financially monetarily was richer in spirit

221
00:15:18,32 --> 00:15:21,14
but. Still you know.

222
00:15:21,85 --> 00:15:26,15
Going to college which.

223
00:15:28,53 --> 00:15:31,55
Works so well it's sort of.

224
00:15:31,57 --> 00:15:34,01
Still a pocket of
idealism when it comes to

225
00:15:34,01 --> 00:15:37,09
that because i think as a lot of people
have ended up on communities and.

226
00:15:37,52 --> 00:15:40,77
Built their own homes and
live fairly low cost life.

227
00:15:40,90 --> 00:15:43,99
You know we do we certainly do and
we know lots of people like that.

228
00:15:44,09 --> 00:15:45,28
You know and that feels great.

229
00:15:45,58 --> 00:15:46,15
And that's the way

230
00:15:46,15 --> 00:15:52,19
that we deal with being able to settle for
a much lower income is because we've got

231
00:15:52,19 --> 00:15:58,97
a much you know this. Costing weekly
yearly you know i mean it's just.

232
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,06
We've set up. That sort of lifestyle.

233
00:16:04,83 --> 00:16:11,51
So we don't draw on too much resources
of the planet. You know do you forget.

234
00:16:13,58 --> 00:16:20,50
You.

235
00:16:20,51 --> 00:16:26,27
Well whenever i have of being making
breakfast in the rainbow one morning i was

236
00:16:26,27 --> 00:16:27,03
making on that

237
00:16:27,03 --> 00:16:31,85
and a friend of mine came in with a box
of a hatful of freshly picked gold tops

238
00:16:31,85 --> 00:16:35,04
which you then put into my
omelet mixture which we all 8

239
00:16:35,04 --> 00:16:38,57
and we were in the process of making a
craft video for the sydney university

240
00:16:38,57 --> 00:16:41,32
without the back we were doing
a spinning it like many was.

241
00:16:43,16 --> 00:16:46,30
And i got in i was spinning
and i was so loaded.

242
00:16:46,58 --> 00:16:51,01
I couldn't by the end of it as i did
you see if i think i better go home.

243
00:16:51,36 --> 00:16:54,38
I can't focus. Oh you got some good.

244
00:16:54,52 --> 00:17:00,16
Oh to do by blowing the paint
on did you think something

245
00:17:00,16 --> 00:17:06,43
and it was just i was just the
whole force. That was good.

246
00:17:06,50 --> 00:17:09,32
So you know i remember a friend
of ours who was pregnant.

247
00:17:09,59 --> 00:17:11,40
This may have just been after aquarius.

248
00:17:11,51 --> 00:17:12,94
And she was very pregnant

249
00:17:12,94 --> 00:17:16,97
and she was playing in the creek down the
bottom near the magic circle down the

250
00:17:16,97 --> 00:17:21,51
bottom of the creek and she stood on a
stone fish and you know what if you know

251
00:17:21,51 --> 00:17:23,32
that you know a bull rabble rouser

252
00:17:23,32 --> 00:17:28,08
and she school re-aim turn
down your journals factor.

253
00:17:28,23 --> 00:17:29,74
Trudy factor off

254
00:17:29,74 --> 00:17:35,79
and she was carried by freedom as is about
six foot three the whole lent the road

255
00:17:35,79 --> 00:17:39,19
and up the town to the hospital
screaming her lungs out

256
00:17:39,19 --> 00:17:45,25
and point you know nearly had a big
fat blubbery when you sit here.

257
00:17:47,08 --> 00:17:48,28
That was funny. I remember that.

258
00:17:49,74 --> 00:17:54,58
Yes i remember going out with a whole bunch
of us in the truck to a country dance

259
00:17:54,58 --> 00:17:57,37
right out in the middle of nowhere. I
wouldn't to this day know where i was.

260
00:17:57,60 --> 00:18:00,38
And it was all the old timers
having a bath. I'm down.

261
00:18:00,39 --> 00:18:03,97
So we were invited and it was the
most beautiful night they danced

262
00:18:03,97 --> 00:18:08,88
and band dances and then gave a source
guns and tea and there was just period.

263
00:18:08,92 --> 00:18:10,44
I'd never seen anything quite like it

264
00:18:10,44 --> 00:18:15,50
but we have actually through the connections
in the pub some very good friends of

265
00:18:15,50 --> 00:18:17,56
the older residents in the town.

266
00:18:17,85 --> 00:18:21,94
Because there weren't such a great
many of us at the beginning

267
00:18:23,04 --> 00:18:26,18
and kneeled. For a horseman.

268
00:18:26,48 --> 00:18:30,78
And i remember going to the
races with jewels and precious

269
00:18:30,78 --> 00:18:35,53
and before we went to the races we saw no
where we'd better get some good closer

270
00:18:35,53 --> 00:18:40,67
into some venues and we found these
three immaculate pinstripes.

271
00:18:40,68 --> 00:18:41,81
And we'd all at

272
00:18:41,81 --> 00:18:45,18
that point in time cut our hair
off like short of the mind is now

273
00:18:45,18 --> 00:18:47,72
and we all called us selves bruce and

274
00:18:47,72 --> 00:18:53,70
when pinstripes not should do so

275
00:18:53,70 --> 00:18:59,78
and it was it was great. Me introduced
us to everybody and brought us beers.

276
00:18:59,85 --> 00:19:02,32
We had the best time we didn't even on

277
00:19:02,32 --> 00:19:05,96
that were all called bruce
that's really funny.

278
00:19:05,98 --> 00:19:09,59
They used to be music in the pub
in the front by the pub here

279
00:19:09,59 --> 00:19:13,05
and we did used to dance. We often
wore a bit and brace overalls

280
00:19:13,05 --> 00:19:17,13
that was kind of our uniform and then we
all blotched with paint and embroidered

281
00:19:17,13 --> 00:19:21,09
and things and we would dance with
the local fellows and they thought

282
00:19:21,09 --> 00:19:25,60
that was great. They've got all their
christmas is a commitment i think.

283
00:19:27,00 --> 00:19:32,47
Partially they have a really good concerts
in the town hall too because of the

284
00:19:32,47 --> 00:19:35,50
white company. And that was great. Fun.

285
00:19:35,81 --> 00:19:41,40
They used to just come up with all sorts
of amazing things breaking new ground in

286
00:19:41,40 --> 00:19:43,83
the theatre and so that was excellent.

287
00:19:44,06 --> 00:19:48,74
We still have some very
nice time you know.

288
00:19:49,83 --> 00:19:55,46
And. Well it was just sort
of part of the creek. So.

289
00:19:55,47 --> 00:19:59,88
To do it right the magic circle was.

290
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,69
There's just this very
beautiful bend in the creek

291
00:20:03,58 --> 00:20:07,57
and it made quite a like a
semicircle and then me and it on.

292
00:20:07,60 --> 00:20:10,74
So when all the dwellings were put there.

293
00:20:11,19 --> 00:20:12,82
It was like a little circle

294
00:20:12,82 --> 00:20:16,02
and in the centre was a big
trench for the cooking fires

295
00:20:16,02 --> 00:20:19,09
and just use the water from the creek.

296
00:20:19,10 --> 00:20:20,69
It was just a very nice place

297
00:20:20,69 --> 00:20:25,58
and course everyone would see
it outside their dwellings and.

298
00:20:25,60 --> 00:20:27,85
And it made the most of

299
00:20:27,85 --> 00:20:31,49
that was the magic so there was
a sauna down there was a sauna

300
00:20:31,49 --> 00:20:35,02
and so we would have hot soreness
and then leak in the creek and.

301
00:20:35,55 --> 00:20:42,08
That's when two got bitten by the ball
when we were doing something like that.

302
00:20:42,87 --> 00:20:46,40
And again just everywhere there
was music. I remember in may.

303
00:20:46,42 --> 00:20:47,44
It was quite cold

304
00:20:47,44 --> 00:20:52,57
and the mists would come up because there's
lots of creeks through here at the back

305
00:20:53,30 --> 00:20:54,09
and then this would car

306
00:20:54,09 --> 00:20:57,85
and you'd be stumbling there's hardly anybody
even owned a torch you know we didn't

307
00:20:57,85 --> 00:20:59,10
know anything much at all

308
00:21:00,01 --> 00:21:04,68
and your big stumbling through the
muse to just missing the creek

309
00:21:04,68 --> 00:21:10,76
or falling over somebody fallen over. It
was very funny and you come into these.

310
00:21:10,78 --> 00:21:13,44
Tense situations or just you know what.

311
00:21:13,44 --> 00:21:17,71
However people had set up some sort
of shelter and little tiny lights

312
00:21:17,71 --> 00:21:22,92
and then you discover all the faces and
there'll be music happening and those.

313
00:21:22,94 --> 00:21:25,62
I remember there was one
lovely one over there and

314
00:21:25,62 --> 00:21:31,43
that guy was there who had made all these
musical instruments the craziest musical

315
00:21:31,43 --> 00:21:35,05
instruments you know we sort of
have to stretch the necks of things

316
00:21:35,05 --> 00:21:36,58
and some were wonderful and

317
00:21:36,58 --> 00:21:41,85
that was one of the best places
to go night was really fun.

318
00:21:43,44 --> 00:21:50,34
So it just stayed on for us

319
00:21:50,34 --> 00:21:53,36
and i for short period of time and
then i went to northern queensland.

320
00:21:53,90 --> 00:21:56,39
Yes that we stayed to
help with the cleaning.

321
00:21:56,76 --> 00:22:03,06
I stayed till august also my friend
jill was having a. Baby jinky was born.

322
00:22:03,80 --> 00:22:09,83
In june july 2 lines.

323
00:22:09,85 --> 00:22:15,67
She was born in july and we waited
until jinky was big enough to travel

324
00:22:15,67 --> 00:22:20,85
and we went back to queensland through.

325
00:22:24,52 --> 00:22:26,34
You know.

326
00:22:27,34 --> 00:22:34,23
So i returned about 16 years ago maybe 15

327
00:22:34,23 --> 00:22:37,35
years ago. You know 15 years ago.

328
00:22:37,85 --> 00:22:44,61
And i had been living in an
asia and america and japan and.

329
00:22:44,63 --> 00:22:47,73
I came back to australia wanting
to settle and have children.

330
00:22:48,77 --> 00:22:53,76
And the only place i thought about was going
was no because the midwife who i spoke

331
00:22:53,76 --> 00:22:56,84
about that lived in the hollow
tree had since become a midwife

332
00:22:56,84 --> 00:22:58,86
and i knew that's what i wanted to do so.

333
00:23:00,22 --> 00:23:03,27
I came back and headed straight for
them and they were friends of mine

334
00:23:03,27 --> 00:23:03,96
and we lived in

335
00:23:03,96 --> 00:23:09,90
and one of the original farm houses in
niman out on our edge smith road belong to

336
00:23:09,90 --> 00:23:14,46
one of the original settlers of an emilia
them i think never sent old farmhouse.

337
00:23:14,48 --> 00:23:17,36
And we came and lived
back there and i taught

338
00:23:17,36 --> 00:23:22,82
but i opened about exterior
for a little while and.

339
00:23:22,83 --> 00:23:25,99
Gone very far since then i
go seeds every now and again

340
00:23:25,99 --> 00:23:30,72
and i say i just settled had
tilled and reared children

341
00:23:30,72 --> 00:23:37,58
and still make craft. You feel you.

342
00:23:39,75 --> 00:23:43,58
Do you know. Yeah we built a house area.

343
00:23:43,69 --> 00:23:48,31
We live on the road community
we've got to yes it was built.

344
00:23:49,68 --> 00:23:55,79
So. Oh oh golly i think before
my husband and i lived there.

345
00:23:55,87 --> 00:23:59,88
We lived in about seven places around
england a number of them one of them was.

346
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:02,96
On a community was grand dunstan
and at the time his wife five

347
00:24:02,96 --> 00:24:05,67
and their children so
that was the early days

348
00:24:05,67 --> 00:24:09,79
when people were beginning to have their
babies at home there was a very big well

349
00:24:09,79 --> 00:24:11,74
once again i think the idealist.

350
00:24:12,83 --> 00:24:17,48
Attitude towards having babies at home
building your homes green veggies gardens

351
00:24:17,48 --> 00:24:21,07
and orchards. Well that was
very viable thing to do

352
00:24:21,81 --> 00:24:24,68
and i think there were something
like 200 babies born in the area

353
00:24:24,68 --> 00:24:25,52
that were born at home

354
00:24:25,52 --> 00:24:29,62
and we would often attend one another's
births sometimes i would go with carol

355
00:24:29,62 --> 00:24:33,07
climbing mountains in the middle of
the night as her birthing assistant.

356
00:24:33,21 --> 00:24:38,37
So there was a still even in those days
with my fantastic feeling in this town.

357
00:24:38,49 --> 00:24:42,51
We had a folk club that people would
come from far and wide to be a part of

358
00:24:42,51 --> 00:24:45,79
and it was just wonderful
cost a dollar to get in

359
00:24:46,67 --> 00:24:50,24
and people who you wouldn't even
know were performers would get up

360
00:24:50,24 --> 00:24:54,31
and just surprise you with the most
viewed of music was really good fun

361
00:24:54,31 --> 00:24:58,35
and even in those days i think it was still
very hard to get so social security.

362
00:24:58,35 --> 00:25:02,80
So there was a lot of sharing
people which share vehicles.

363
00:25:02,82 --> 00:25:06,59
You know there was work days more
days and there was a lot of sharing

364
00:25:06,59 --> 00:25:12,90
that took place as well.

365
00:25:12,90 --> 00:25:15,53
The start of the home but
i think movement was.

366
00:25:15,54 --> 00:25:18,01
Carol elliott who was a
trained acupuncturist

367
00:25:18,01 --> 00:25:23,49
and very interested in homoeopathy
who had had four children herself.

368
00:25:23,51 --> 00:25:28,70
She was alone midwife she had i think
she's since a qualified midwife

369
00:25:28,70 --> 00:25:30,62
and you went to london and
got her qualifications

370
00:25:30,62 --> 00:25:32,88
but at the time she was a lady midwife

371
00:25:33,57 --> 00:25:36,57
and she would go to people's
places very inaccessible.

372
00:25:37,07 --> 00:25:40,93
Like i mean i remember one birth she went
to right at the end of the governess

373
00:25:40,93 --> 00:25:46,21
valley and it was during a wet season and
the lady couldn't get out and so carol

374
00:25:46,21 --> 00:25:50,68
and her men norman waited the creek and
it was one of those extended labors

375
00:25:50,68 --> 00:25:54,45
and so basically they would just go to
people's homes and they would set up camp

376
00:25:54,45 --> 00:25:59,94
and sometimes they'd be there
for days and. You know p.

377
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,03
Would have their babies the way they
wanted to which was very soft lighting.

378
00:26:05,05 --> 00:26:09,13
And the ents that and you weren't
hurried my first child was born out it.

379
00:26:09,20 --> 00:26:10,67
Excellent in the farmhouse it carol.

380
00:26:10,72 --> 00:26:15,89
And norman and i lived in the
labor was very easy six hours.

381
00:26:16,05 --> 00:26:18,13
I had people sitting in
the room meditating.

382
00:26:18,41 --> 00:26:18,77
He was born

383
00:26:18,77 --> 00:26:22,20
and then later started in the early hours
of the morning his phone at lunch time

384
00:26:22,99 --> 00:26:25,50
and it was just no hurry.

385
00:26:25,52 --> 00:26:28,72
Nobody has so do i done a
lot of reading and i think

386
00:26:28,72 --> 00:26:30,04
that was the thing most women

387
00:26:30,04 --> 00:26:32,64
that were compared to have their babies
at home really took responsibility for

388
00:26:32,64 --> 00:26:36,38
educating themselves about the process. So
even though i don't know what to expect.

389
00:26:36,81 --> 00:26:38,76
I basically knew what was going to happen

390
00:26:38,76 --> 00:26:43,39
and carol was very telepathic woman she
were just a highly intuitive highly

391
00:26:43,39 --> 00:26:48,55
intuitive and she was told you don't have
that yet. And you know intuits what next.

392
00:26:48,87 --> 00:26:52,67
You would do you know wave a pendulum over
your belly to see where you were right

393
00:26:52,67 --> 00:26:54,10
at what stage you laver

394
00:26:54,10 --> 00:26:58,97
and you know she'd give you some homeopathic
so she would basically just talk about

395
00:26:58,97 --> 00:27:02,23
and do what she had to do and when the
birth was over you'd all drink champagne

396
00:27:02,23 --> 00:27:04,08
and eat chocolate cake

397
00:27:04,08 --> 00:27:07,13
or fruit cake with a favorite you
were said to bake bread cake for her

398
00:27:07,13 --> 00:27:12,14
but she did in fact deliver many
of the children that people.

399
00:27:12,15 --> 00:27:17,78
Gave names too like rain for them softly
inside and things like my sons of god.

400
00:27:17,93 --> 00:27:20,96
Jesse and right.

401
00:27:21,88 --> 00:27:22,94
And very beautiful children

402
00:27:22,94 --> 00:27:27,12
and in those days everyone was having babies
there was a really big baby boom here

403
00:27:27,12 --> 00:27:29,96
and so there was a lot of community.

404
00:27:30,08 --> 00:27:33,56
Living and with small children and
we would start play groups together

405
00:27:33,56 --> 00:27:40,22
and basically share.

406
00:27:40,24 --> 00:27:41,39
Its return.

407
00:27:41,92 --> 00:27:44,08
Well she worked on a donation basis

408
00:27:44,08 --> 00:27:46,81
and unfortunately that's where
things really went wrong.

409
00:27:46,92 --> 00:27:51,14
I feel because she was often people would
come from a long way away to have their

410
00:27:51,14 --> 00:27:53,17
baby and they would end
up staying with carol

411
00:27:53,17 --> 00:27:56,62
and they wouldn't have much in the way
of money so they'd either pay her with

412
00:27:56,62 --> 00:27:59,72
cabbages or you know barter something and.

413
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:02,83
They eventually got to the point where
carolyn and i couldn't live like

414
00:28:02,83 --> 00:28:07,39
that anymore. And after having that
happen to them for years on end they felt

415
00:28:07,39 --> 00:28:10,97
that they she didn't have to shouldn't
have had to be on the dole doing what they

416
00:28:10,97 --> 00:28:14,56
were doing and in any other place
they wouldn't have had that abused

417
00:28:14,56 --> 00:28:19,85
but unfortunately it did become difficult
for them so they ended up going to live

418
00:28:19,85 --> 00:28:24,94
in london and can very well known
very famously made a lot of money.

419
00:28:27,02 --> 00:28:28,80
Was there.

420
00:28:28,82 --> 00:28:35,01
But it was done on a barter
system really i think.

421
00:28:35,02 --> 00:28:37,18
Almost 30 years. Well that's right.

422
00:28:39,37 --> 00:28:45,36
But you know it's got to be the best
injury and the best my second child.

423
00:28:45,55 --> 00:28:48,09
I think i think so. It was
a room. You know bigger.

424
00:28:48,50 --> 00:28:51,59
Maybe as big as this room
here which is what 12 by 10

425
00:28:51,59 --> 00:28:55,58
and there were 18 people there
five of them were children.

426
00:28:56,07 --> 00:28:59,86
My oldest son jesse was a
birth attendant he looked.

427
00:28:59,95 --> 00:29:06,13
I mean he couldn't get any closer. He gave
a running commentary like money at this.

428
00:29:06,34 --> 00:29:09,70
Everybody if it's not like that
and my brother and i took photos

429
00:29:09,70 --> 00:29:14,06
and he would have been rightly you almost
between my legs i mean he got the most

430
00:29:14,06 --> 00:29:16,55
expressive birth photos and
i didn't even notice him.

431
00:29:16,62 --> 00:29:17,66
There were people everywhere

432
00:29:18,43 --> 00:29:20,86
and would just you know ways to
say it's like a birthday party

433
00:29:20,86 --> 00:29:26,05
but it was so personal and so intense
that it really didn't matter and each

434
00:29:26,05 --> 00:29:30,00
and every one of those people has a connection
with my children unless they got to

435
00:29:30,75 --> 00:29:36,08
be president. We just have a birth
recently on rob road. Most recent birth.

436
00:29:36,43 --> 00:29:41,33
And. Marilyn's eldest son is 15.

437
00:29:42,93 --> 00:29:45,86
And who next about it and this baby came

438
00:29:45,86 --> 00:29:49,56
and you show me sitting at the bottom of
the bed saying this is not my mother's

439
00:29:49,56 --> 00:29:53,53
best feature but there are things like

440
00:29:53,53 --> 00:29:58,21
that with the room again you know like
it's so you just get drawn there you know

441
00:29:58,21 --> 00:30:02,84
you think. Yes ok i will only.
These people will come but.

442
00:30:04,07 --> 00:30:05,84
Who then has the baby come you know

443
00:30:05,84 --> 00:30:10,27
or nearly nearly you know on the energy
so intense that you can't walk away.

444
00:30:10,52 --> 00:30:11,40
So by the end of

445
00:30:11,40 --> 00:30:16,62
that birthing there was a whole lot of
bounce around with semicircle around the

446
00:30:16,62 --> 00:30:19,59
bottom of the bed and quite
a few mainly aldrin who

447
00:30:19,59 --> 00:30:24,10
and all the kids you know who went to
school the next day for their personal

448
00:30:24,11 --> 00:30:25,26
development class and said.

449
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:33,33
Experience best personal development
we've ever had the baby.

450
00:30:34,41 --> 00:30:36,62
Because of us and indeed.

451
00:30:36,95 --> 00:30:39,73
Yeah it's wonderful here

452
00:30:39,73 --> 00:30:43,55
and then we would have blessing ceremonies
there was one absolutely beautiful one

453
00:30:43,55 --> 00:30:47,57
where i fact there's been many of them where
mark visited this erica that's another

454
00:30:47,57 --> 00:30:47,82
thing

455
00:30:47,82 --> 00:30:51,96
that people know a lot of people around
this area into meditation of some sort

456
00:30:51,96 --> 00:30:56,67
and so we get incredible visits
from very high spiritual beings

457
00:30:56,67 --> 00:31:01,12
and on a couple of occasions we've had
them do naming ceremony for our children

458
00:31:01,12 --> 00:31:03,63
where people from far and
wide would bring their babies

459
00:31:03,63 --> 00:31:06,69
and they would be given a spiritual
name and then there'd be a celebration

460
00:31:06,69 --> 00:31:13,53
and a blessing and a very
beautiful. Yeah. Those.

461
00:31:16,28 --> 00:31:22,92
You know that the post office that
has been committed is around.

462
00:31:24,70 --> 00:31:28,27
This a smith who used around the
post of an im and he was a saint.

463
00:31:28,35 --> 00:31:31,17
He was ready for retirement. So
he figured he would by himself.

464
00:31:31,42 --> 00:31:34,65
The smallest post-office he could
find and retired to nimbin.
