1
00:00:15,51 --> 00:00:21,76
I've like. Twenty four. You know three.

2
00:00:23,73 --> 00:00:26,67
Years.

3
00:00:27,55 --> 00:00:31,64
I don't think there ever will be or perhaps
needs to be another name investable

4
00:00:31,64 --> 00:00:31,92
but it

5
00:00:31,92 --> 00:00:36,07
but it's interesting to speculate i think
the two thousand will obviously be a

6
00:00:36,07 --> 00:00:37,86
momentous time you know

7
00:00:37,86 --> 00:00:41,16
and not not too often do you live
through the change of a millennium.

8
00:00:41,23 --> 00:00:45,20
But it'll be a momentous time for australia
because it does represent the you know

9
00:00:45,20 --> 00:00:46,79
rescinding the federation

10
00:00:46,79 --> 00:00:53,38
and as all the point is after a time to
australia to look to you know to what its

11
00:00:53,38 --> 00:00:58,12
future is going to be in the 21st
century but it's interesting i think

12
00:00:58,12 --> 00:01:01,24
that the celebrations that
do happen and i'm convinced

13
00:01:01,24 --> 00:01:05,04
that there'll be fairly interesting
celebrations whether the weather wave hosting

14
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:09,31
the olympics in the year 2000 or not i
think not exactly relevant but i think

15
00:01:09,31 --> 00:01:16,19
that the celebrations will happen anyway.
But i think it will be very much about.

16
00:01:17,45 --> 00:01:18,89
Seeing that changed role

17
00:01:18,89 --> 00:01:22,66
and i mean who knows there's another sort
of you know seven eight years and all

18
00:01:22,66 --> 00:01:26,18
that time too and how what shifts
australia augusta and that point of time.

19
00:01:26,29 --> 00:01:30,34
I'm not sure but i was not sure i would
call that another nimbin i think that.

20
00:01:30,85 --> 00:01:31,11
What

21
00:01:31,11 --> 00:01:37,10
that celebrations is going to be about is
really estradiol having arrived in southeast

22
00:01:37,10 --> 00:01:42,65
asia and. And having grown up and matured.

23
00:01:43,22 --> 00:01:48,92
And i think now we all find that very
exciting i mean and i think that.

24
00:01:48,93 --> 00:01:53,23
Not too many people probably i people
will argue with that. The forms of it.

25
00:01:53,23 --> 00:01:55,56
I don't think too many people
really argue with the fact

26
00:01:55,56 --> 00:02:00,31
that australia is now standing on its own
two feet in this part of the world. And.

27
00:02:00,99 --> 00:02:03,76
I guess the other the other
difference with that is

28
00:02:03,76 --> 00:02:08,71
that nimbin was very much about a section
of australia celebrating it was if you

29
00:02:08,71 --> 00:02:10,84
like the.

30
00:02:10,86 --> 00:02:15,02
What i sometimes call the sensitive antenna
in the horns of a rhinoceros it was the

31
00:02:15,02 --> 00:02:18,01
sort of people who had their head
up and after sort of realised

32
00:02:18,01 --> 00:02:22,64
that the changes were happening and bob
dylan's line something's happening

33
00:02:22,64 --> 00:02:24,38
but you don't know what
it is the mr james.

34
00:02:25,25 --> 00:02:27,13
It wasn't the whole of
australia celebrating.

35
00:02:27,42 --> 00:02:31,88
I think then in a sense in the bicentenary
this step was a much more general

36
00:02:31,88 --> 00:02:34,92
celebration lay there were people
rightly saying that you know

37
00:02:34,92 --> 00:02:37,04
that there were certain
things in australia

38
00:02:37,04 --> 00:02:40,61
that we you know had to think very
much about what we were celebrating

39
00:02:40,61 --> 00:02:46,34
and why to me the word celebrate as an act
of verb i mean it always it always beats

40
00:02:46,34 --> 00:02:50,67
a question celebrate what and
why celebrate and if you apply

41
00:02:50,67 --> 00:02:56,30
that to the 2000 what it leads you into
is is some pretty deep thinking about you

42
00:02:56,30 --> 00:03:02,17
know your framework in
your culture and i think

43
00:03:02,17 --> 00:03:05,86
that. My hope for the year 2000.

44
00:03:05,88 --> 00:03:09,66
It is if there is a celebration it will
be in australia wide celebration abused

45
00:03:09,66 --> 00:03:13,58
and celebration that all australians
can take part in and for

46
00:03:13,58 --> 00:03:18,39
that to be a valid celebration i think it
will have to come to terms finally with

47
00:03:18,39 --> 00:03:19,57
the aboriginal issue

48
00:03:19,57 --> 00:03:22,82
and i think there are any simple
answers to the aboriginal question

49
00:03:22,82 --> 00:03:27,66
but if if we haven't managed to at least
come to terms with the treaty in some

50
00:03:27,66 --> 00:03:31,67
better understanding of aboriginal
australia by the year 2000 and i think

51
00:03:31,67 --> 00:03:38,51
that you know. We can't really have
a valid celebration of australia.

52
00:03:38,56 --> 00:03:41,95
So i think that will be one dimension.
And then the other dimension will be.

53
00:03:43,36 --> 00:03:45,70
Where we do stand in
relation to southeast asia.

54
00:03:46,06 --> 00:03:50,89
I mean the image in my mind of a celebration
for the year 2000 as one with a kind

55
00:03:50,89 --> 00:03:54,36
of you know balinese galleons over there

56
00:03:54,36 --> 00:03:57,34
and singaporean line
dancers they were there

57
00:03:57,34 --> 00:03:59,80
and laying puppets from indonesia
over there and you know as.

58
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:00,64
Celebration

59
00:04:00,64 --> 00:04:07,01
that acknowledges our place in the world
not an arts festival of largely european

60
00:04:07,01 --> 00:04:10,51
and american culture sort of you know
transplanted to this play a part of the world

61
00:04:10,51 --> 00:04:14,57
and one might ask why our festival stay
there really reflect reflect that.

62
00:04:14,69 --> 00:04:18,80
How will be more than they do but i
think the times are coming and i think

63
00:04:18,80 --> 00:04:24,06
that you know the celebrations of australia
in the year 2000 are very likely i

64
00:04:24,06 --> 00:04:28,82
think that i'm guessing here but in the you
know. Seven or eight years in between.

65
00:04:29,10 --> 00:04:30,42
I think that'll be the dimension.

66
00:04:30,46 --> 00:04:35,60
We've sort of starting to
realize in grapple distantly

67
00:04:35,60 --> 00:04:38,80
and intellectually with the fact
that we're part of southeast asia

68
00:04:38,80 --> 00:04:43,53
but we're not grappling with that. Yet in
terms of what does this mean culturally.

69
00:04:43,70 --> 00:04:48,40
I mean you know we still really expect
asians i think to learn our language

70
00:04:48,40 --> 00:04:50,67
and learn our ways in
fact i mean relate to us.

71
00:04:50,71 --> 00:04:55,76
That's like we haven't there nearly
enough of you know going in learning the

72
00:04:55,76 --> 00:04:59,05
language and learning their ways
and then exploring the culture

73
00:04:59,05 --> 00:05:01,76
and as i say i don't just
mean that aunts and.

74
00:05:02,45 --> 00:05:07,06
In the food and the music but i mean
exploring the realities and i think

75
00:05:07,06 --> 00:05:10,82
that that's if the if there
are any valid dimensions to.

76
00:05:10,83 --> 00:05:14,86
The celebration in the year 2000. Maybe
that is the name the new the year 2000.

77
00:05:14,88 --> 00:05:19,80
I don't know.

78
00:05:19,82 --> 00:05:22,23
I don't get frustrated
with very much anymore.

79
00:05:22,85 --> 00:05:26,79
It's perhaps because my expectations.

80
00:05:26,81 --> 00:05:32,37
My expectations so changed
and also because. I think.

81
00:05:33,86 --> 00:05:39,22
In terms of in terms of the pace of this
change i mean whether whether i don't

82
00:05:39,22 --> 00:05:40,74
really get get frustrated with

83
00:05:40,74 --> 00:05:44,43
that i guess because i've arrived
at a point where are not.

84
00:05:45,14 --> 00:05:47,24
I think it istiklal enough anymore.

85
00:05:47,40 --> 00:05:50,45
I think i was when i was younger
i think that i have the answers.

86
00:05:50,59 --> 00:05:53,91
I mean i think we're all grappling with
all these questions at many levels.

87
00:05:54,32 --> 00:05:57,97
All of the time and i don't have any
medical answers for any of these things

88
00:05:57,97 --> 00:05:59,70
and i don't think you know my health.

89
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:00,89
Either so

90
00:06:00,90 --> 00:06:06,21
that the change will always be sort of you
know you know three steps forward here

91
00:06:06,21 --> 00:06:11,50
and two steps back where i don't really
get frustrated by it anymore i just see

92
00:06:11,50 --> 00:06:15,06
that the process is what's
interesting about it.

93
00:06:15,31 --> 00:06:17,20
I enjoy the process and

94
00:06:17,20 --> 00:06:21,39
or mostly joy into i mean i am one less
fortunate people i love what i do.

95
00:06:21,42 --> 00:06:25,11
I mean organising celebrations if no
one was prepared to pay me to do it.

96
00:06:25,11 --> 00:06:30,99
It's to do it. I think it's the most enjoyable
thing to do that. I possibly could.

97
00:06:31,07 --> 00:06:37,71
Doing so i enjoy that the process enormously.
I don't always enjoy the product.

98
00:06:38,95 --> 00:06:41,50
If some celebration sort of
please me more than others

99
00:06:41,50 --> 00:06:46,27
but i don't think i get frustrated
by it. I guess sometimes i just.

100
00:06:47,86 --> 00:06:54,09
And i guess the nice thing about. About my
current situation is that it's cyclical.

101
00:06:54,66 --> 00:06:57,36
I mean once dealing with a
program of celebrations

102
00:06:57,36 --> 00:07:00,67
and events through the if it doesn't
happen one year the way quite alike

103
00:07:00,67 --> 00:07:04,03
or the way you want to put it
aside and go back to it next year

104
00:07:05,20 --> 00:07:08,99
and i think we're finally
i mean my satisfaction is

105
00:07:10,34 --> 00:07:16,24
that i think we are finally
creating an australian culture.

106
00:07:16,25 --> 00:07:20,78
We're finally creating those sort of landmarks
i member graeme dunstan sort of you

107
00:07:20,78 --> 00:07:22,80
know saying at one stage that

108
00:07:22,80 --> 00:07:25,91
that his measure of a celebration
was whether it was something

109
00:07:25,91 --> 00:07:30,71
that you measured your life by in
terms of people say look you know.

110
00:07:32,04 --> 00:07:34,96
Sue and ted got married before
this this into the bicentenary

111
00:07:34,96 --> 00:07:38,50
or our laden had a baby you know.

112
00:07:38,52 --> 00:07:39,15
Afternoon

113
00:07:39,15 --> 00:07:44,21
and so once celebrations become sort of
part of the measuring yardsticks of your

114
00:07:44,21 --> 00:07:50,60
life you know you've arrived and and
once celebrations become a kind of.

115
00:07:51,52 --> 00:07:53,84
A calendar that people people accept

116
00:07:53,84 --> 00:07:56,82
and that's what that's what i've
always been striving to do to try

117
00:07:56,82 --> 00:07:59,87
and bring outdoor celebration in.

118
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,10
Events to the point where people sort
of accept that it's part of their lives

119
00:08:03,10 --> 00:08:04,08
and there's a few

120
00:08:04,08 --> 00:08:10,85
that i think we always as i mean new year's
eve in australia for as long as i can

121
00:08:10,85 --> 00:08:11,42
remember back to

122
00:08:11,42 --> 00:08:15,95
when i was a kid was always special you
didn't consider going to be before me the

123
00:08:15,95 --> 00:08:18,22
news you stray lived to
be in a social situation

124
00:08:18,22 --> 00:08:24,04
and to be there was a sense of the sun
finally importance about this day

125
00:08:24,04 --> 00:08:26,89
that made you want to be
part of where it was a party

126
00:08:26,89 --> 00:08:29,85
or whether it was a sort of you
know a celebration of fireworks

127
00:08:31,09 --> 00:08:32,96
and a thousand people
and having abba think

128
00:08:32,96 --> 00:08:35,34
that two years ago we had
something a 400000 people.

129
00:08:36,52 --> 00:08:39,79
It is a without any advertising
opperman just a herd instinct

130
00:08:39,79 --> 00:08:41,19
that people want to be together.

131
00:08:41,47 --> 00:08:45,03
I've always rather admired

132
00:08:45,04 --> 00:08:48,18
and vince like the envious of
asian cultures which which have

133
00:08:48,18 --> 00:08:49,35
that almost into them.

134
00:08:49,39 --> 00:08:52,71
I mean i'm a member spinning a bit
of time afternoon when i went back

135
00:08:52,71 --> 00:08:57,51
and spent some times of the bowels of
bengal up in central been y'all and

136
00:08:57,51 --> 00:09:00,79
and it traveled for about three months
through the indian villages with them

137
00:09:01,70 --> 00:09:04,64
and i member very clearly that you
would wake up on a certain day and.

138
00:09:05,21 --> 00:09:09,62
Nobody needed to announce it or
tell you just everybody knew that

139
00:09:09,62 --> 00:09:12,82
that day was a celebration day and
there was no thought of going off

140
00:09:12,82 --> 00:09:14,39
and healing the rice fields that this.

141
00:09:14,43 --> 00:09:17,92
On this day everyone sort of you know took
their plates of fireable sugared sweets.

142
00:09:18,18 --> 00:09:20,37
Went down to the river and.

143
00:09:21,59 --> 00:09:26,68
And in fact i if there was ever an
experience in my life anywhere else.

144
00:09:26,85 --> 00:09:32,78
Close to christ and him
and. I went with that.

145
00:09:32,80 --> 00:09:36,84
Of the bowels to a celebration in
central bengal called the milat.

146
00:09:37,17 --> 00:09:40,88
When they came over to nim and they
looked around the set up is a meal

147
00:09:40,88 --> 00:09:45,78
that we know. So when i went over to
bengal they put me to this meal that was

148
00:09:45,78 --> 00:09:48,35
that was held on the banks of
the ganges in this little town

149
00:09:48,35 --> 00:09:52,59
and it would i think it was something
like kind of 2000 years every year this

150
00:09:52,59 --> 00:09:53,38
miller had been held

151
00:09:54,34 --> 00:09:58,86
and it was all determined by the moon phases
in the calendar so bowels right across

152
00:09:58,86 --> 00:09:59,95
bengal no one.

153
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:02,66
Need to sort of you know to
put up posters or to announce

154
00:10:02,66 --> 00:10:04,60
that this mailer was held on this state.

155
00:10:04,64 --> 00:10:07,87
Everybody just knew i mean because that
was the moon cycle this was the date

156
00:10:07,87 --> 00:10:10,94
when it was always help and
it it always been held.

157
00:10:11,07 --> 00:10:15,60
You know for you know for centuries
and this spot by the river

158
00:10:15,60 --> 00:10:19,99
and these ancient ancient trees were always
the spot where purcell so i went with

159
00:10:19,99 --> 00:10:21,42
this. Person

160
00:10:21,42 --> 00:10:26,20
and asked by all in his touring party here
the way the way it work was very tribal

161
00:10:26,20 --> 00:10:28,78
i mean certain people kind of
you know went and played host

162
00:10:28,78 --> 00:10:32,47
and then sort of their whole kind
of tribal structure would arrive

163
00:10:32,47 --> 00:10:34,54
and they would look after them
and feed them and entertain.

164
00:10:34,58 --> 00:10:37,77
So we're a fairly we write about
a week before this thing and

165
00:10:38,48 --> 00:10:41,83
and we've been travelling by car
and whatever you know if it.

166
00:10:41,85 --> 00:10:45,22
Hours and hours and finally got
to this partner stable we're here

167
00:10:46,14 --> 00:10:47,79
and then said you mean it was nothing.

168
00:10:49,74 --> 00:10:53,04
Well it was was a sort of you know a bit
of riverbank sort of you know on the edge

169
00:10:53,04 --> 00:10:55,24
of this sandy desert and there was nothing

170
00:10:55,24 --> 00:10:57,22
that the eye could see for
miles in any direction.

171
00:10:57,55 --> 00:10:59,28
So we pitched camp

172
00:10:59,28 --> 00:11:02,91
and sure enough over the next ten days
you'd see these figures on the horizon.

173
00:11:03,48 --> 00:11:06,59
I mean many people would walk at this
thing inwardly find sort of you know four

174
00:11:06,59 --> 00:11:08,24
weeks before so i could walk to it.

175
00:11:08,32 --> 00:11:10,88
You just see these figures
slowly coming over the horizon.

176
00:11:11,25 --> 00:11:12,95
It might take three or four hours so

177
00:11:12,95 --> 00:11:15,28
when you first potted them to
act they got close enough that

178
00:11:15,28 --> 00:11:18,81
that you could actually make
out any of their features

179
00:11:18,81 --> 00:11:21,12
and then slowly over this
sort of you know week

180
00:11:21,12 --> 00:11:24,39
or 10 days just these thousands i don't
know how many people came to this ng

181
00:11:24,39 --> 00:11:29,04
hundred thousand probably over these days
you know as tens of thousand people to

182
00:11:29,04 --> 00:11:32,34
slowly kind of roll in
an oxcart sort on foot.

183
00:11:32,47 --> 00:11:35,60
You know one of the few groups
that can by car. I might add.

184
00:11:35,69 --> 00:11:39,84
And just all around me. There's a
wonderful festival sort of took place.

185
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:44,67
You know people sort of you know brought
things bundles under their arms

186
00:11:44,67 --> 00:11:46,36
and sort of you know.

187
00:11:46,38 --> 00:11:52,09
Things in little carts and sort of all
these little little city sprang up

188
00:11:52,09 --> 00:11:55,54
and wonderful concerts happened
and wonderful banquets were held

189
00:11:55,54 --> 00:11:59,87
and then sort of you know the moon
phase signal that it's time for.

190
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,00
Me allowed to end and just as quickly as

191
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:03,48
that it all happened everything packed up

192
00:12:03,48 --> 00:12:06,87
and everyone knew so these little figures
taking four hours to disappear on the

193
00:12:06,87 --> 00:12:10,06
horizon and we actually stayed until
after the whole thing was over

194
00:12:10,06 --> 00:12:14,67
and it went right back to being this saintly
bank with nothing visible for miles in

195
00:12:14,67 --> 00:12:16,42
any direction and it's

196
00:12:16,42 --> 00:12:21,45
that sort of thing i've always kind of a
say in mean admired you know what a pity

197
00:12:21,45 --> 00:12:26,64
we don't live in a situation that has
that sort of the pin and instinct

198
00:12:26,64 --> 00:12:30,51
and understanding and what a pity
celebration isn't so much part of our lives

199
00:12:30,51 --> 00:12:34,48
that it's a step as in that you know
arguable i'm questioning sort of way

200
00:12:35,42 --> 00:12:37,01
but i think slowly that is happening.

201
00:12:38,23 --> 00:12:42,95
So the australians are creating a
celebrations calendar for themselves.

202
00:12:43,24 --> 00:12:46,49
And funnily enough it's come out of
celebrations i mean i don't think we're

203
00:12:46,49 --> 00:12:48,64
particularly spiritual
or religious country

204
00:12:48,64 --> 00:12:51,97
but i mean it has sort of it has picked
up sort of you know traditions like

205
00:12:51,97 --> 00:12:52,96
christmas and whatever

206
00:12:52,96 --> 00:12:57,38
but i don't think it's necessarily for
quick greatly religious reasons but

207
00:12:57,38 --> 00:13:00,72
but they are becoming
very real celebrations.

208
00:13:00,92 --> 00:13:04,40
We do a christmas pageant down here
each year that has a cast of thousands

209
00:13:04,40 --> 00:13:08,30
and sort of you know as many people turn
up to it as we can possibly sort of you

210
00:13:08,30 --> 00:13:09,20
know feed into the place

211
00:13:09,98 --> 00:13:13,38
and it's interesting seeing these traditions
growing it's got to the point where

212
00:13:13,38 --> 00:13:17,62
you know people make their own costumes
and so there's a communications network

213
00:13:17,62 --> 00:13:23,54
but i think if we almost if we stopped
organizing it would happen but the court

214
00:13:23,54 --> 00:13:24,54
and i feel

215
00:13:24,54 --> 00:13:29,47
that that's that's that's sort of was one
of the cheap ones of nimbin actually

216
00:13:29,47 --> 00:13:31,64
that i mean you know.

217
00:13:31,66 --> 00:13:35,02
This 10 day festival happened
it took quite a lead up

218
00:13:35,02 --> 00:13:39,81
and not 20 years later there's a community
of people around there still celebrating

219
00:13:39,81 --> 00:13:40,02
it.

220
00:13:40,76 --> 00:13:44,63
It's rather interesting talking to a younger
generation now because they have no idea.

221
00:13:44,71 --> 00:13:47,54
I mean it's sort of nimbin the
name invest or came out of nowhere

222
00:13:47,54 --> 00:13:52,31
and went to nowhere as far as our concern
in fact one other interesting story

223
00:13:52,31 --> 00:13:54,26
that i quite often tell in

224
00:13:54,99 --> 00:13:59,93
and one of my trips up to nimbin which was
a train trip on the overnight sort of.

225
00:14:00,82 --> 00:14:04,78
No wasn't express up to lismore. I got on.

226
00:14:06,13 --> 00:14:08,13
Onto the train and sat
down in this carriage

227
00:14:08,13 --> 00:14:10,63
and they were sort of
they were sort of eight

228
00:14:10,64 --> 00:14:14,93
or ten young teenagers sitting
for five yards away from me

229
00:14:14,93 --> 00:14:19,88
and one of them was telling this story about
how our course he was he was slightly

230
00:14:19,88 --> 00:14:22,97
older and so he was sort of you know.

231
00:14:22,99 --> 00:14:27,76
Telling the ropes in this story about
how to suddenly on one weekend.

232
00:14:28,15 --> 00:14:31,84
All of these thousands of hippies from all
over the country decide they'd somehow

233
00:14:31,84 --> 00:14:36,70
got this mysterious signal and it
all up and converged on nimbin.

234
00:14:36,72 --> 00:14:39,30
And i remember thinking if
only it was that simple.

235
00:14:41,38 --> 00:14:43,02
If only they were this mysterious

236
00:14:43,86 --> 00:14:46,04
that just sort of do people
like them sort of magnet

237
00:14:46,04 --> 00:14:51,16
and felt like sort of saying hey do you
realize the sort of the hundreds of people

238
00:14:51,16 --> 00:14:54,61
who put countless hours
of thought now let it go.

239
00:14:56,33 --> 00:15:00,29
But if a young male here i'm young. Sheldon.
But i think it's quite interesting.

240
00:15:00,64 --> 00:15:05,29
I mean i think that. The
younger generation that nimbin

241
00:15:05,29 --> 00:15:10,40
that doesn't mean strange not very good
at preserving its own cultural history.

242
00:15:10,53 --> 00:15:11,30
I always feel.

243
00:15:11,42 --> 00:15:17,22
I mean partly because we're dominated by
what dylan thomas called the barrier of a

244
00:15:17,22 --> 00:15:21,08
common language if we didn't speak
english or american be a lot easier

245
00:15:21,08 --> 00:15:26,51
but because so many of our cultural are
artifacts of been you know american films

246
00:15:26,51 --> 00:15:29,94
and american cartoons and idea
over the years and british

247
00:15:29,94 --> 00:15:34,16
but more recently american we
lose our own cultural history.

248
00:15:34,28 --> 00:15:40,43
I mean the people in the 30s i mean most
australians of a certain age in a certain

249
00:15:40,43 --> 00:15:42,31
you if you mention sort of you know.

250
00:15:42,66 --> 00:15:47,94
American figures like
ensberg or barrios or.

251
00:15:47,96 --> 00:15:50,19
Or you know the.

252
00:15:50,21 --> 00:15:54,98
John cage or you know that the great
musical figures or at figures they would

253
00:15:54,98 --> 00:15:59,89
and i talking about but mention similar
innovators from australia from.

254
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:00,48
The thirties.

255
00:16:02,19 --> 00:16:06,05
You know it's most people know you're
talking about we're just we haven't kept

256
00:16:06,06 --> 00:16:07,31
their own cultural history

257
00:16:08,83 --> 00:16:11,67
and i think that's continued you know
pretty much this that's getting better.

258
00:16:11,95 --> 00:16:18,10
But i think that i mean i actually used to
always think in the years after nimbin.

259
00:16:18,12 --> 00:16:22,91
A store always think you know nimbleness
probably a pale reflection of what

260
00:16:22,91 --> 00:16:26,18
happened in. In america in europe

261
00:16:26,18 --> 00:16:29,72
and you know what what a pity i
wasn't in san francisco doing a spear

262
00:16:29,72 --> 00:16:35,77
and missed all that because i never travel
overseas before then and in 19. Seventy.

263
00:16:35,96 --> 00:16:40,21
Seventy six. I finally scraped
a few dollars together

264
00:16:40,21 --> 00:16:41,70
and did my pilgrimage went off

265
00:16:41,70 --> 00:16:44,46
and sort of you know spent the
year traveling through the states

266
00:16:44,46 --> 00:16:46,43
and traveling three of and
visiting a lot of these places

267
00:16:46,43 --> 00:16:50,22
that had been reading about them
and been inspirational to me

268
00:16:50,22 --> 00:16:55,39
and meeting meeting people who'd
been inspirational and went off

269
00:16:55,39 --> 00:16:58,33
and spent some time at
the tennessee found.

270
00:16:58,35 --> 00:17:01,95
Stephen gaskin and sort of went off the
fin door and spent some time at vinton

271
00:17:01,95 --> 00:17:05,50
and you know countless other kind
of you know cultural makers.

272
00:17:07,31 --> 00:17:09,82
New age movement and you know i sat there

273
00:17:09,82 --> 00:17:14,76
and talked with countless people
about woodstock etc. Etc.

274
00:17:14,76 --> 00:17:16,73
and Came to a conclusion over a period

275
00:17:16,73 --> 00:17:17,94
that you know what had
happened in australia.

276
00:17:18,53 --> 00:17:22,91
You know was by no means making in
fact sounded to me a jolly sight more

277
00:17:22,91 --> 00:17:27,68
interesting in many ways
than than than things

278
00:17:27,68 --> 00:17:31,19
that i had thought were you know perhaps
were much better than they were

279
00:17:31,19 --> 00:17:35,87
but the skill is i mean we never got around
to making nimbin the movie people got

280
00:17:35,87 --> 00:17:37,41
around to making woodstock the movie

281
00:17:38,74 --> 00:17:43,87
and i think that's the difference we haven't
so perhaps that's a good thing i guess

282
00:17:43,87 --> 00:17:47,82
for that reason our cultural tradition
probably hasn't been is distorted

283
00:17:47,82 --> 00:17:51,60
and exaggerated that we're also sort of
you know perhaps in danger of losing it

284
00:17:52,43 --> 00:17:56,96
and i think it's probably only fairly
recently the younger generation is starting

285
00:17:56,96 --> 00:17:59,89
to look past that and i think a
lot of the a lot of the prob..

286
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,10
Ms in the country love the fact

287
00:18:01,10 --> 00:18:04,20
that we don't appreciate the aboriginal
background and the aboriginal heritage

288
00:18:04,20 --> 00:18:06,07
that have to do with the fact

289
00:18:06,07 --> 00:18:12,89
that we we've looked at our culture through
the filter of the first edition you pay

290
00:18:12,89 --> 00:18:14,99
in and then american culture
and that's why i think

291
00:18:14,99 --> 00:18:18,56
that cultural shift is so important
that we're seeing australia

292
00:18:18,56 --> 00:18:20,57
and its own terms and i think
there will probably come a time

293
00:18:20,57 --> 00:18:25,54
when we start researching all of that and
digging it out and saying well okay.

294
00:18:26,17 --> 00:18:28,34
Not only how did the
nimbin festival happen

295
00:18:28,34 --> 00:18:32,35
but you know what was the stray lee of the
30s like what were the sort of you know

296
00:18:32,35 --> 00:18:35,17
that the radical movements in
the afternoons and either.

297
00:18:35,28 --> 00:18:39,42
And i thought i think we
we undervalue theirs.

298
00:18:39,44 --> 00:18:43,73
So it may well be that
some some teacher point

299
00:18:43,73 --> 00:18:49,95
that same teenager travelling up in
the chain to lismore abc won't be so

300
00:18:51,14 --> 00:18:55,29
divinely unconscious of how all these
things happen because the other side of it.

301
00:18:55,32 --> 00:18:58,83
I think is it's important to appreciate
how they do happen. I mean you know.

302
00:19:00,33 --> 00:19:02,31
For my experience.

303
00:19:02,33 --> 00:19:09,15
Nothing in i'm talking here about
the area celebrations and events.

304
00:19:09,17 --> 00:19:15,97
The better organised they are. The more
they look as a they happen just by magique.

305
00:19:15,99 --> 00:19:22,55
But i have never seen a substantial of
event in western countries at least that's

306
00:19:22,56 --> 00:19:26,24
that's worked very well with where there
hasn't been enormous planning in energy

307
00:19:26,24 --> 00:19:28,76
and detail and whatever it's got into it

308
00:19:29,68 --> 00:19:32,91
and i think it's probably pretty important
for people to you know to realise

309
00:19:32,91 --> 00:19:36,35
that that's that that's what makes i
mean that the vision and the spirit

310
00:19:36,35 --> 00:19:40,79
and whatever all important but so is
the sort of answer metaphore for life.

311
00:19:40,83 --> 00:19:44,84
I suppose so is the getting down to the tin
tacks of it you know how is this going

312
00:19:44,84 --> 00:19:48,63
to happen. One of the mechanics
was actually quite interesting.

313
00:19:49,01 --> 00:19:51,00
I mean in 1980 so you know end up

314
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:55,36
and participated in a 10
year anniversary festival at

315
00:19:55,36 --> 00:19:58,06
that nimbin by virtue if you
people really happened.

316
00:19:58,08 --> 00:20:01,43
Saying over 10 years are up me saying so.
No i'm saying well what we do about it.

317
00:20:02,94 --> 00:20:06,74
And that happened. The experience
was interesting i mean.

318
00:20:06,75 --> 00:20:08,24
I tried to go back

319
00:20:08,24 --> 00:20:13,35
and repeat a little bit the pattern
of 173 went up there at easter time

320
00:20:13,35 --> 00:20:15,36
and sort of announced

321
00:20:15,37 --> 00:20:19,37
that we were going to sort of hold a
festival creation workshop we were going to

322
00:20:19,37 --> 00:20:22,80
sort of invite anyone.
Everyone to come along

323
00:20:22,80 --> 00:20:26,88
and talk about what this what this
anniversary festival is going to be so we

324
00:20:26,88 --> 00:20:29,03
ensconced ourselves in
that effect out there

325
00:20:29,03 --> 00:20:31,04
and sort of you know
over a couple of days.

326
00:20:31,27 --> 00:20:35,26
I mean loads of people hundreds of people
probably came through all terribly

327
00:20:35,26 --> 00:20:38,37
concerned to talk about whether this was
going to be about environmental women

328
00:20:38,37 --> 00:20:41,16
or aborigines. And i
thought oh good you know

329
00:20:41,16 --> 00:20:42,57
when we get all this out of the way

330
00:20:42,57 --> 00:20:44,17
when we're you know where
we've cleared the air

331
00:20:44,17 --> 00:20:47,51
when we know why we're all doing it
then we can actually start planning.

332
00:20:49,11 --> 00:20:51,71
To my dismay was a one sided
cleared all and decided

333
00:20:51,71 --> 00:20:54,75
that they actually drew up a real sort
of list that's going to be about these

334
00:20:54,75 --> 00:20:59,42
things and then a size icons that was it.

335
00:20:59,44 --> 00:21:03,86
No one was left sitting i
think you know at the next.

336
00:21:05,15 --> 00:21:09,45
How do we how do we dig this year tells i
how do we organize the food supply lines

337
00:21:09,45 --> 00:21:11,76
all of the things that that are basically

338
00:21:11,76 --> 00:21:16,08
that did x steps i take a
rather prosaic view of it but

339
00:21:16,08 --> 00:21:20,19
that was i think we.

340
00:21:20,21 --> 00:21:24,06
One of the the things that
struck me from that period was

341
00:21:24,06 --> 00:21:29,54
that we've we've produced a fairly
intellectual place for generation that's in a

342
00:21:29,54 --> 00:21:33,41
sense over educated i think i mean with
with so many of us have been through

343
00:21:33,41 --> 00:21:37,45
university and so you know good it
conceptual thinking in theorizing

344
00:21:37,45 --> 00:21:42,96
that we can think out of all these issues
that when it. There's not a lot of.

345
00:21:42,98 --> 00:21:49,24
A real basic sort of hands on
practical skilling the end.

346
00:21:49,24 --> 00:21:49,34
Perhaps

347
00:21:49,34 --> 00:21:53,92
and that's critique of the education system
i suppose in a diss in indecent teaching

348
00:21:53,92 --> 00:21:56,12
people how to think conceptual.

349
00:21:56,14 --> 00:21:59,29
We probably need to be thinking in
celebrations we need to be thinking about

350
00:21:59,29 --> 00:22:06,26
teaching. Well how you do it and i don't
see a lot of a lot of that happening.

351
00:22:07,45 --> 00:22:12,58
I suppose these days it's harder in
the period that led up to newman and

352
00:22:12,58 --> 00:22:15,51
when i talked earlier about some of
the things of starting rock venues

353
00:22:15,51 --> 00:22:20,50
and what it was a bit of a simpler society
in those days i mean if you were only 19

354
00:22:20,50 --> 00:22:22,90
and you only had a couple of
hundred dollars to your name.

355
00:22:22,94 --> 00:22:24,71
If you were lucky you could actually go

356
00:22:24,71 --> 00:22:28,74
and pay the first the first month's rent
on a building in you could actually sort

357
00:22:28,74 --> 00:22:33,62
of you know grab a sound system strap a
stage in and start of a new these days.

358
00:22:33,67 --> 00:22:36,55
This is feeling that everything
has become so super professional

359
00:22:36,55 --> 00:22:40,41
that it's all you know an issue got
backers and finance and lawyers

360
00:22:40,41 --> 00:22:44,63
and you know you can't do anything and i
think that's a bit sad because i think

361
00:22:44,63 --> 00:22:47,88
that part of that spirit of an
emblem was there and we can do it.

362
00:22:47,92 --> 00:22:53,13
Spirit that you know that it's not
only in their ends of the entrepeneurs

363
00:22:53,13 --> 00:22:55,01
and and.

364
00:22:57,73 --> 00:22:59,65
The moneyed the money part of town

365
00:23:00,57 --> 00:23:03,61
but if you can conceive anything strong
enough you can do it and i must admit

366
00:23:03,61 --> 00:23:07,01
when we think back to how naively we
stepped into some of those things.

367
00:23:07,13 --> 00:23:12,36
It was naive but carried off as i said
the bottom line is that nobody started.

368
00:23:12,66 --> 00:23:17,32
Nobody died and you know and perhaps.

369
00:23:17,33 --> 00:23:19,72
As we have now i think what's happened is

370
00:23:19,72 --> 00:23:24,05
that the societies becoming
increasingly specialized and.

371
00:23:25,35 --> 00:23:28,79
An increasingly professionalized
and maybe that's a good thing

372
00:23:28,79 --> 00:23:30,26
but i think with the young people.

373
00:23:30,28 --> 00:23:32,99
I think we're probably reaching another
one of those watersheds if we're not

374
00:23:32,99 --> 00:23:35,97
careful. We're going to go
right back to where we were

375
00:23:35,97 --> 00:23:40,86
when i came in in the 50s that that

376
00:23:40,86 --> 00:23:44,54
that things are run by these
older generation that has

377
00:23:44,54 --> 00:23:48,26
or all of the finance thus all of
the power and all of the strings

378
00:23:48,26 --> 00:23:52,13
and the younger generation that doesn't
have a lot of power over their own lives

379
00:23:52,13 --> 00:23:53,37
and their own decision making.

380
00:23:54,31 --> 00:23:57,24
I mean obviously there are young people
that that come crashing through all that

381
00:23:57,24 --> 00:23:59,85
and and do fantastic things but i think.

382
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:02,48
These harder and i think
it's one of the things that.

383
00:24:04,90 --> 00:24:09,24
We're going to have to come to
terms with i mean sometimes i feel

384
00:24:09,24 --> 00:24:13,80
that we were closer 20 years ago to coming
to terms with some of those things.

385
00:24:13,99 --> 00:24:17,42
I mean i think we all realized then
although we realized intellectually

386
00:24:17,42 --> 00:24:19,00
that there wasn't going
to be work for everyone

387
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:21,06
that we were going to
increasingly have machines

388
00:24:21,06 --> 00:24:26,19
and computers do it then we're going
to have to not have to the joy was

389
00:24:26,19 --> 00:24:29,81
that we were going to arrive at a
society where people work less

390
00:24:29,81 --> 00:24:32,67
and had more leisure and
we haven't achieved

391
00:24:32,67 --> 00:24:36,97
that we seem to arrive at the society
where one group of the population works

392
00:24:36,97 --> 00:24:41,36
harder than than is you know particularly.

393
00:24:42,32 --> 00:24:43,66
Desirable for people to work

394
00:24:43,66 --> 00:24:47,97
and of the whole bunch of the population
is alienated and has no access to that

395
00:24:47,97 --> 00:24:52,85
and sits on their bum. So we haven't
achieved the right balance and.

396
00:24:52,86 --> 00:24:56,83
I'm not sure we have.
We've achieved there out.

397
00:24:58,25 --> 00:25:02,39
The right balance of power are there.
Because that's come back to power.

398
00:25:02,50 --> 00:25:06,32
I mean i think we've disenfranchised lots
of groups in the not only their regionals

399
00:25:06,32 --> 00:25:09,66
way in danger of disenfranchising
young people in this city.

400
00:25:09,96 --> 00:25:15,10
And all sorts of other groups. So i think
we have to grapple with those things and.

401
00:25:16,29 --> 00:25:19,67
I think that i hope there's a role
there for us the celebrations

402
00:25:19,67 --> 00:25:24,96
and i hope there's a ralph and in that
i mean even seems to me to become now.

403
00:25:25,79 --> 00:25:28,96
Both a set of ideas.

404
00:25:28,98 --> 00:25:34,89
And a mental spiritual community
as much as a physical community.

405
00:25:35,03 --> 00:25:38,00
I mean i know lots of people that
don't physically live it and in

406
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:43,03
that actually seen him in the nimbin
community is some importance to be liars

407
00:25:44,13 --> 00:25:45,44
and i hope in the air that.

408
00:25:46,06 --> 00:25:48,96
Some of that exploring
and radical thinking

409
00:25:48,96 --> 00:25:52,34
and innovating is still happening
because i think less of the things that

410
00:25:52,34 --> 00:25:58,92
that spurred on that first
decision any years ago.

411
00:25:58,93 --> 00:25:59,37
Way.

412
00:26:07,42 --> 00:26:14,00
Oh yeah i remember that one but.

413
00:26:17,27 --> 00:26:17,52
The one

414
00:26:17,52 --> 00:26:23,07
that sticks in my mind of for one for one
reason is you are what you eat which i

415
00:26:23,07 --> 00:26:26,42
take a very basic statement of
despite all the intellectual ism.

416
00:26:26,51 --> 00:26:33,09
Ach in terms of whether i can you know
can can sum up some of the insights of

417
00:26:33,09 --> 00:26:36,23
nimbin in a few words it's always hard.

418
00:26:37,29 --> 00:26:40,06
One of the ones that that sticks
in my mind is is one that

419
00:26:40,06 --> 00:26:43,28
when benson used to use
quite a bit which is.

420
00:26:43,29 --> 00:26:47,73
You are what you eat which is on a very
basic statement st spired all the fine

421
00:26:47,73 --> 00:26:53,20
thinking intellectualising
etc.. Basically it's or.

422
00:26:53,22 --> 00:26:57,18
Reduce it all to very simple
things and the other one.

423
00:27:00,61 --> 00:27:04,67
I lost my train of thought for a moment.

424
00:27:07,08 --> 00:27:12,79
There was another one.
The interesting was.

425
00:27:13,55 --> 00:27:18,77
One other sort of if you like slogan i
think they sings are slogans because in a

426
00:27:18,77 --> 00:27:21,42
few words they can't be any
deeper than that one when that

427
00:27:21,42 --> 00:27:26,45
that always stayed with me was. Was that
one of the balinese years which is that.

428
00:27:27,08 --> 00:27:30,91
We have no art we simply do everything
as well as we can and i think

429
00:27:30,91 --> 00:27:31,95
that was to me.

430
00:27:31,96 --> 00:27:37,07
Bit of a statement of the art the artfulness
tore the artless ness of the movement

431
00:27:43,36 --> 00:27:48,52
and made it interesting
musically. Musical phrases.

432
00:27:49,96 --> 00:27:53,79
Always sort of stick with the three years
in the years where no in other things

433
00:27:53,79 --> 00:27:56,97
fired i mean maybe the long
time since i was a particular

434
00:27:56,97 --> 00:28:02,22
that was an im mandela i
guess. Which as you know.

435
00:28:02,24 --> 00:28:05,29
Certainly you know gave me great.

436
00:28:05,31 --> 00:28:11,46
Invigoration and energy at the
time and still that's. Thank you.
