dollar and sintered into dollars
destroying the environment with a dollar.

24
00:02:27,20 --> 00:02:38,49
Or you know using the
dollar as a as a weapon.

25
00:02:40,30 --> 00:02:44,44
It is so i came here in 1973.

26
00:02:44,45 --> 00:02:48,05
With a performance troupe
we called ourselves the.

27
00:02:49,47 --> 00:02:53,43
The classic forget the name now.

28
00:02:53,60 --> 00:02:57,17
The mad metaphysical magic.

29
00:02:58,80 --> 00:03:03,38
We call our so many physical matter which
we came with a performance on how do you

30
00:03:03,38 --> 00:03:08,33
wells which we trumped up was a time machine
we trumpet up into sort of like the

31
00:03:08,33 --> 00:03:13,58
mechanical people and the beautiful
people you know sort of the mechanical

32
00:03:13,58 --> 00:03:15,80
and the people in the more free
spirit living on the earth

33
00:03:15,80 --> 00:03:20,52
and you had the mechanical people live
done of the which was a sort of split the

34
00:03:20,52 --> 00:03:26,29
h.g. Wells of how the society will
split in the future and i played it.

35
00:03:26,76 --> 00:03:28,06
I played it's time traveller

36
00:03:28,82 --> 00:03:34,36
and i mean we sort of was very interesting
if it really worked because it was very

37
00:03:34,36 --> 00:03:39,57
fitting to the environment
but when i came here.

38
00:03:40,65 --> 00:03:44,48
Our props ended up taking
off to. See brisbane.

39
00:03:44,61 --> 00:03:49,44
So we were out in the field there
and we setting up a sort of.

40
00:03:49,46 --> 00:03:50,41
A spot

41
00:03:50,41 --> 00:03:55,23
and i ended up doing dance workshops every
morning in them in town hall for throughout

42
00:03:55,23 --> 00:03:58,51
and then went towards the end of the
festival we had our props down we did our

43
00:03:58,51 --> 00:03:59,92
performance as we.

44
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,07
Just sort of you know

45
00:04:01,07 --> 00:04:03,52
that the group of us just went
around just did things all around

46
00:04:04,32 --> 00:04:06,53
or so much going on. You
just sort of participated

47
00:04:06,53 --> 00:04:12,42
and just became more freeform in
in participating. Around the.

48
00:04:13,13 --> 00:04:15,64
The the area around the site area.

49
00:04:16,12 --> 00:04:21,40
And participating in forums and
raging with the different bands

50
00:04:21,40 --> 00:04:26,44
and getting with other
people and doing things.

51
00:04:29,31 --> 00:04:32,42
Well the highlight was
doing the performance.

52
00:04:32,44 --> 00:04:38,29
It was quite missed mysterious event.

53
00:04:38,31 --> 00:04:42,15
The acoustic was in the in the bush factory
before was the bush fact it was all the

54
00:04:42,15 --> 00:04:46,90
scaffolding set up and i remember
we had the screen up there and.

55
00:04:47,17 --> 00:04:51,03
And i was i use the scaffolding
to get these dramatic sounds

56
00:04:51,03 --> 00:04:54,25
and it just sort of created these
dramatic so because we had these.

57
00:04:54,81 --> 00:04:59,22
We had this sort of beautiful white
garments which it turned around was black

58
00:04:59,22 --> 00:05:00,41
and and skull.

59
00:05:00,96 --> 00:05:05,59
And so we had this sort of contrasty
images of the sort of just really light

60
00:05:05,59 --> 00:05:06,22
carried them

61
00:05:07,05 --> 00:05:11,51
and then then with the light show we had
tom pollock doing poetry rove you know tom

62
00:05:12,30 --> 00:05:17,32
and he was doing sort of the sort of
freeform pollock tree interludes to interact

63
00:05:17,32 --> 00:05:21,88
with the with the people in and telling
them the story of the time machine.

64
00:05:22,15 --> 00:05:27,50
So it was semi we used the script as
a sort of improvised improvise on

65
00:05:28,60 --> 00:05:33,03
and seems the movements. So it
was all that sort of hang it on.

66
00:05:33,04 --> 00:05:34,31
On that and

67
00:05:34,31 --> 00:05:38,08
and interacting with people with fruit
you know coming out with bowls of fruit.

68
00:05:39,64 --> 00:05:44,98
And with that with the the law either
sort of beautiful people and then then.

69
00:05:46,36 --> 00:05:49,81
Sam angelica was the executioner
sort of chopping off people's heads.

70
00:05:50,06 --> 00:05:52,72
You know with these magic in terms of.

71
00:05:54,01 --> 00:05:59,57
When we doing the the
mechanical stuff and sort of.

72
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:01,80
Processing going.

73
00:06:01,82 --> 00:06:07,89
Very interesting because that place
the bush fact he was a meat works.

74
00:06:07,91 --> 00:06:12,20
And in the later days and.

75
00:06:14,68 --> 00:06:16,48
Had a nice energy there then.

76
00:06:17,43 --> 00:06:23,09
Still got a nice energy there.

77
00:06:23,10 --> 00:06:28,92
Oh the bush video here that was set up by.

78
00:06:28,94 --> 00:06:31,19
A whole group.

79
00:06:32,67 --> 00:06:38,96
Combined group of people which for
which just from the universities the

80
00:06:38,96 --> 00:06:42,39
universities we were just getting
into sort of porter packs.

81
00:06:42,61 --> 00:06:43,83
Having porter packs and then.

82
00:06:44,91 --> 00:06:50,94
Interacting with the community on on
issues and people can take the tapes out

83
00:06:50,94 --> 00:06:52,35
and people can go out there and make.

84
00:06:52,90 --> 00:06:58,38
Make make their own video what's
around them and get feedback

85
00:06:59,66 --> 00:07:01,10
and just was sort of

86
00:07:02,17 --> 00:07:06,68
that process just came on on the
market so group came up here

87
00:07:06,68 --> 00:07:08,00
and decided to set up a.

88
00:07:11,11 --> 00:07:16,30
Set up a whole network with within the
like with the cable link up for the site

89
00:07:17,05 --> 00:07:17,95
just ideas and

90
00:07:18,69 --> 00:07:23,78
and just developing their technology as a
sort of an internal monitoring of what's

91
00:07:23,78 --> 00:07:26,89
going on. People went out in the
field and took out the packs

92
00:07:26,89 --> 00:07:30,90
and videotape what they
wanted and. You know.

93
00:07:30,92 --> 00:07:35,52
And then brought it back and it was shown
out to people. People just look at it.

94
00:07:36,46 --> 00:07:39,42
In the site which is.

95
00:07:39,44 --> 00:07:44,66
Yeah well that is all it was all done by
young people never didn't know about it.

96
00:07:44,71 --> 00:07:46,63
It's just sort of their.

97
00:07:46,65 --> 00:07:48,16
Learning about it a lot of

98
00:07:48,16 --> 00:07:53,24
and even people within the field are just
learning about how to handle this this

99
00:07:53,24 --> 00:07:58,95
equipment. So it's quite a you know
having it's quite expensive too.

100
00:08:03,97 --> 00:08:07,57
Oh a member that had one
highlight was a birthing

101
00:08:07,57 --> 00:08:12,25
that took place on at the
at the first i saw that

102
00:08:12,25 --> 00:08:20,05
that was quite incredible actually a birth
at the aquarius vessel was actually.

103
00:08:20,07 --> 00:08:24,54
Monitored back from the
day before two people

104
00:08:25,42 --> 00:08:29,46
and just the whole thing was
quite a culture shock for me.

105
00:08:30,76 --> 00:08:33,99
But that was that was that was one
of the things i was the highlights

106
00:08:33,99 --> 00:08:38,20

Well you had different stages for one dollar
brand was a high one of the highlights.

00:08:55,90 --> 00:08:59,33
Long stints of piano playing
really beauty from south africa.

111
00:09:00,02 --> 00:09:05,35
Was great and i used to go down and dance
and do interact with dance with people

112
00:09:05,35 --> 00:09:09,46
and get these things happening
with them develop these sort of.

113
00:09:09,48 --> 00:09:15,39
Things that was part of my thing.
It was not only was i. A dancer.

You know so i trained dancer turned into.

115
00:09:19,51 --> 00:09:24,46
You know freeing up the form but i developed
in that form through the melbourne.

116
00:09:24,68 --> 00:09:30,43
Early stages in melbourne in that sort
of late 60s and 70s interact with bands

117
00:09:31,17 --> 00:09:35,81
and sort of become a cat are used as a
sort of a catalyst a form of catalyst to

118
00:09:35,81 --> 00:09:39,97
together. There was a name that.

119
00:09:40,42 --> 00:09:43,12
I developed a name for it
was sort of like a crowd.

120
00:09:45,13 --> 00:09:49,15
A crowd stimulate or
something like that a crowd.

121
00:09:49,17 --> 00:09:52,18
You know and i've got had i was
doing things that this goes

122
00:09:53,04 --> 00:09:56,43
and where i be on stage and i go out
and do things in the congo lines

123
00:09:56,43 --> 00:09:59,34
and little groups stand thing arrays
you know just sort of just tie.

124
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,76
It all ends up so there's a focus. So for
you. So take take the whole dance thing.

125
00:10:06,78 --> 00:10:11,26
Interact with them things so you get these
groups things happening with band of

126
00:10:11,27 --> 00:10:13,80
people.

127
00:10:16,69 --> 00:10:18,26
And the other things are just other things

128
00:10:18,26 --> 00:10:23,89
that took place during the things was
just there was also still a petite

129
00:10:25,14 --> 00:10:30,87
doing is highway that that really was
amazing. And there was the room.

130
00:10:30,89 --> 00:10:34,21
I he sort of just. You know put up.

131
00:10:34,89 --> 00:10:39,63
It just sort of coming with a
unicycle and you'll see string up.

132
00:10:40,11 --> 00:10:43,50
You know just this. Thin.

133
00:10:44,04 --> 00:10:47,65
Thing guy with the black hat he was
dressed in black with coat tails and

134
00:10:47,65 --> 00:10:52,90
that you know just coming
in and i'll draw this line.

135
00:10:53,63 --> 00:10:54,01
You know

136
00:10:54,01 --> 00:10:58,97
and you start doing this thing with the
first of all he clearly the space by using

137
00:10:58,97 --> 00:11:02,42
a unicycle to clear the
space and just shouldn't.

138
00:11:02,44 --> 00:11:05,36
And then draw the line around and did all

139
00:11:05,36 --> 00:11:11,24
that sort of traditional french sort of
mime type sequences to get to committee i

140
00:11:11,24 --> 00:11:15,56
was no voice it was just miming
then he had these juggling

141
00:11:15,56 --> 00:11:17,17
and all the sort of things.

142
00:11:17,19 --> 00:11:20,39
That's pretty much in vogue
with with street performers.

143
00:11:20,48 --> 00:11:20,83
Now

144
00:11:20,83 --> 00:11:25,65
when he was a sort of he brought it pretty
fresh into this country wasn't very vocal.

145
00:11:25,66 --> 00:11:28,66
Then it was probably was
probably a first rate performer.

146
00:11:29,86 --> 00:11:36,30
Doing it in australia because it was pretty
much like it was a strange scene he had

147
00:11:36,30 --> 00:11:41,40
to go through some strange scenes
here because it was pretty much.

148
00:11:42,21 --> 00:11:45,46
The authorities wouldn't allow
him to do these sort of things

149
00:11:45,46 --> 00:11:46,97
that wasn't there wasn't a forum for it.

150
00:11:46,98 --> 00:11:49,45
These things have to be
battled down the track to

151
00:11:50,38 --> 00:11:55,34
when you know getting by laws passed that
people could do these things but it.

152
00:11:55,37 --> 00:11:58,84
Firstly just sort of like the aquarius
festival's a good forum for him to try this

153
00:11:58,84 --> 00:12:01,47
have seen it was an open. If. Open.

154
00:12:02,01 --> 00:12:05,99
Social.

155
00:12:06,00 --> 00:12:09,78
Forum to try out new
ideas and free theater.

156
00:12:10,47 --> 00:12:13,46
In many forms were taking place
not only just philippa teeth

157
00:12:13,46 --> 00:12:16,99
but he's the string up the wire and
he did that you know between the pub

158
00:12:16,99 --> 00:12:18,22
and tomatoes i remember.

159
00:12:18,62 --> 00:12:22,14
And you know sort of the modus of which
the neighbourhood centre you center now

160
00:12:22,91 --> 00:12:26,25
and used to do the thing there in
jungle and how it just amazing. Just.

161
00:12:26,87 --> 00:12:32,77
Did these things and he had a reputation
of of stringing up the. The high wire.

162
00:12:33,18 --> 00:12:36,81
On the not to dam and high places
around the world he sought and he did

163
00:12:36,81 --> 00:12:39,92
when he went to sydney tried it
did it on the sydney harbour

164
00:12:39,92 --> 00:12:42,87
and they say they started
the take down his rope

165
00:12:42,87 --> 00:12:44,62
when he was up there authorities freaked.

166
00:12:44,78 --> 00:12:48,36
It was a really dangerous he was
like to actually undoing the rope

167
00:12:48,36 --> 00:12:53,00
when he was up there and see these things
like. Pretty dangerous thing to do.

168
00:12:54,14 --> 00:12:55,44
But he was he was a highlight.

169
00:12:56,51 --> 00:13:01,30
I mean sort of just observing him
in there was fred robinson and his.

170
00:13:01,32 --> 00:13:06,35
Urantia rays you know it is this whole
new agey this whole connection.

171
00:13:07,67 --> 00:13:09,65
In new age sort of
thinking that way around.

172
00:13:10,17 --> 00:13:16,89
It was the food you know that sort of
trust food thing and food kitchen was all

173
00:13:16,89 --> 00:13:23,43
that sort of. Cooperate. You know people
on trust and cooperation. The whole.

174
00:13:23,45 --> 00:13:24,83
Festival was based on.

175
00:13:25,18 --> 00:13:29,29
Just allowing animals the shitters like
this were whole things they was quite think

176
00:13:29,29 --> 00:13:34,00
that was one of the first was well the
first time i ever went to a festival where

177
00:13:34,00 --> 00:13:40,52
where where everybody just there was in a
circle in any shape in a circle like you

178
00:13:40,52 --> 00:13:41,65
know it will have this circle

179
00:13:41,65 --> 00:13:48,18
and it was all open there was sort of
mixed it was you know was no sort of

180
00:13:49,30 --> 00:13:54,93
sexual sort of decision everybody came
in there and just composted there.

181
00:13:55,06 --> 00:13:58,90
The spot on the bottom you became ill.
You know was the whole awareness of you.

182
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,96
I was very good because they became
aware of your own bodily functions

183
00:14:03,96 --> 00:14:06,47
and broke down a lot of. Mr.

184
00:14:06,47 --> 00:14:10,62
Myths from living in the city and there
was there was another good thing and

185
00:14:11,54 --> 00:14:16,18
and there was the saunders
and. Sort of these things.

186
00:14:16,20 --> 00:14:20,55
And just being you and the
bamboo bridges across the creek.

187
00:14:21,95 --> 00:14:24,71
Was the form of this it all these
things all these huts and things

188
00:14:24,71 --> 00:14:30,27
that we've built out of all these
diverse lorraine array of dwellings

189
00:14:30,27 --> 00:14:34,51
that we've put up and.

190
00:14:34,53 --> 00:14:38,58
And remember our theatre
group developed a.

191
00:14:38,59 --> 00:14:44,86
Sort of the well developed dwelling you
know relating to our little sigh i think i

192
00:14:44,86 --> 00:14:48,85
was interesting. It was pretty.

193
00:14:49,51 --> 00:14:53,69
Ratty tatty but it was sort of you
know we never done it before.

194
00:14:54,77 --> 00:14:59,64
But we set it up and was the place where
we got under was plastic and and bamboo

195
00:14:59,64 --> 00:15:03,37
and stuff. And kept the

196
00:15:04,26 --> 00:15:07,36
and there was always sheltered

197
00:15:07,36 --> 00:15:13,69
and we had a shelter up. You know.

198
00:15:17,41 --> 00:15:22,71
I came to nimbin well like a lot i just
came you know with the with the trip to be

199
00:15:22,71 --> 00:15:26,87
part of this festival because i was at
festivals like it's not the first festival i

200
00:15:26,87 --> 00:15:29,58
went to i was part of the sort of.

201
00:15:29,60 --> 00:15:34,65
Festival dress like i had a lawn and
before and i wasn't turn on then it was.

202
00:15:37,12 --> 00:15:42,28
My pongal and. And. And in victoria.

203
00:15:42,29 --> 00:15:45,40
We had.

204
00:15:45,42 --> 00:15:50,75
Was it was sunbury years
it was the sundries and.

205
00:15:50,77 --> 00:15:53,04
The one before that casting it was known

206
00:15:53,04 --> 00:15:55,68
but there was a few of
these sort of events

207
00:15:55,69 --> 00:16:01,15
and also being part of you know indoor
events. With much more boring and.

208
00:16:01,46 --> 00:16:06,59
I will ask of sort of intermedia.

209
00:16:06,61 --> 00:16:13,42
Get togethers. And. So yeah. So there was.

210
00:16:13,63 --> 00:16:16,88
There was a connection and
that's when i got here

211
00:16:16,88 --> 00:16:21,24
and it's just just widen the whole.

212
00:16:21,25 --> 00:16:27,82
You know what what festivals can do like
festivals where actually setting up social

213
00:16:29,71 --> 00:16:32,27
you know he really can learn
from festivals. A lot.

214
00:16:32,31 --> 00:16:36,48
I mean there's this that you
learn about society is as it is

215
00:16:36,48 --> 00:16:38,65
and people learn there and it can change

216
00:16:38,65 --> 00:16:41,50
that the learn to change because
you just set up experiments

217
00:16:41,50 --> 00:16:42,77
and it's only temporary.

218
00:16:43,02 --> 00:16:46,31
I mean it's something that's going to be
temporary but you can really go for it

219
00:16:46,31 --> 00:16:50,54
and just do it. As a as
a microscope on ideas.

220
00:16:52,27 --> 00:16:57,72
With everybody.

221
00:16:57,74 --> 00:17:02,71
I stayed on because then it was the
the ideas of getting a community.

222
00:17:03,78 --> 00:17:05,30
Well getting a property.

223
00:17:05,98 --> 00:17:08,76
Many for many reasons to get a whole
lot of property so that the people

224
00:17:08,76 --> 00:17:14,89
that are here have a place where they can
keep their ideas going like develop their

225
00:17:14,89 --> 00:17:17,61
ideas from the experience
from their career festival

226
00:17:17,61 --> 00:17:19,69
and people had different ideas like

227
00:17:19,69 --> 00:17:24,66
that the total commune idea of like here
we are living here during the aquarius

228
00:17:24,66 --> 00:17:28,81
festival forming this is a society
where we all care and share

229
00:17:28,81 --> 00:17:31,80
and do everything you know get
some problem try and do that.

230
00:17:32,85 --> 00:17:38,18
And it was that sort of idealistic
idealism that i was around at the time

231
00:17:38,18 --> 00:17:41,81
and also very poor people you know
very poor at the work something.

232
00:17:41,95 --> 00:17:47,82
How we do it and and also people
that had dropped out as such.

233
00:17:47,84 --> 00:17:48,68
And

234
00:17:49,71 --> 00:17:55,60
and were shunned upon in different ways
because they were not part of the status

235
00:17:55,60 --> 00:17:59,69
quo and. Types and they
were students as well.

236
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,67
Because there was there's disillusionment
there's a lot of social reasons why this

237
00:18:04,68 --> 00:18:09,77
stake in place the disillusionment with
the whole was this with the wall with the

238
00:18:09,77 --> 00:18:15,89
war mentality and and the whole
philosophical discussion about about

239
00:18:15,90 --> 00:18:22,59
that attitude towards you know
we had real social problems

240
00:18:22,59 --> 00:18:25,81
to sort out and let alone.

241
00:18:25,83 --> 00:18:29,14
The the earth in getting back to the garden
the sort of was the sort of spin off

242
00:18:29,14 --> 00:18:31,75
from woodstock itself like as well.

243
00:18:31,88 --> 00:18:38,69
And that that was it that had a big impact
on me. You know like woodstock itself.

244
00:18:38,71 --> 00:18:42,19
And i guess a lot of people here i
think doesn't it was a hidden thing

245
00:18:42,19 --> 00:18:46,18
and this became the sort
of australia's woodstock.

246
00:18:46,25 --> 00:18:49,01
That's how it turned out to be i don't
i don't know who was intentionally

247
00:18:49,01 --> 00:18:54,69
but it was what the university had in mind
it was going to be a woodstock. But it.

248
00:18:54,71 --> 00:18:59,43
It was that because woodstock was
also when i was over in america.

249
00:18:59,44 --> 00:19:01,50
I discovered that and reading about it.

250
00:19:01,61 --> 00:19:05,52
That was the same thing was going on
there was that disillusionment and

251
00:19:06,65 --> 00:19:09,79
and as it all these philosophers
and writers in these issues

252
00:19:09,79 --> 00:19:15,22
and trying to express a different
world from the world of of.

253
00:19:16,00 --> 00:19:19,10
Of competitive.

254
00:19:19,11 --> 00:19:23,91
Smashing and pushing and killing
and raping to something

255
00:19:23,91 --> 00:19:28,61
that gets back to the earth
and gentle caring all

256
00:19:28,61 --> 00:19:34,66
that sort all those sort of that sort
of society like develop a society in

257
00:19:34,67 --> 00:19:35,20
that sort of way

258
00:19:35,20 --> 00:19:44,14
and they've given the name aquarius.

259
00:19:44,93 --> 00:19:48,72
How did that. Progress. Well it meant.

260
00:19:49,01 --> 00:19:53,76
We just have to work on our ideas
and i mean it's so to me it.

261
00:19:53,77 --> 00:19:59,80
It's been successful because. It's
successful as much energy as what.

262
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,68
All have discovered and certain

263
00:20:02,68 --> 00:20:07,42
and a lot of what what has been experimented
on is made itself into the mainstream

264
00:20:07,42 --> 00:20:12,39
like the mainstream just takes the
cream of ideas that really you know

265
00:20:12,39 --> 00:20:14,56
that they think can work with mainstream.

266
00:20:14,74 --> 00:20:21,04
And you know you have alternative healing
processes the health health food said you

267
00:20:21,04 --> 00:20:27,49
terry. An ism. That's been advanced
from. That sort of thinking the.

268
00:20:27,50 --> 00:20:33,91
All these different co-ops and that
around the place you know. And the wall.

269
00:20:33,92 --> 00:20:38,03
You know listen less people getting
away from thinking about about fighting

270
00:20:38,03 --> 00:20:43,26
and finding solutions to
consider good solution and.

271
00:20:44,28 --> 00:20:48,36
This quite you know just a
lot of just in the health

272
00:20:48,36 --> 00:20:51,69
and healing aspect there's heaps in.

273
00:20:53,95 --> 00:20:56,65
Permaculture and that's developed
but it sort of grew out of

274
00:20:56,65 --> 00:20:58,54
that interest in the earth

275
00:20:58,54 --> 00:21:04,50
and an alternative of internet
to monarch culture that's for

276
00:21:05,63 --> 00:21:07,45
people living on the
earth here and realising

277
00:21:07,45 --> 00:21:12,00
that modern culture is destroying the
earth but it's just part of that thinking

278
00:21:12,00 --> 00:21:16,49
that that's lateral thinking it's not
that there's not that sort of level

279
00:21:16,49 --> 00:21:17,20
that where you think

280
00:21:17,20 --> 00:21:22,74
that society because this is the way it
is is the way it can't be changed from

281
00:21:22,74 --> 00:21:28,97
there because you upset society when actual
fact that you that there is a role for.

282
00:21:28,99 --> 00:21:30,95
For dropping out

283
00:21:30,95 --> 00:21:36,31
and trying out ideas as part
of the creative artists role

284
00:21:37,50 --> 00:21:41,76
or taking on that role. Yes always.

285
00:21:41,85 --> 00:21:48,33
I enjoy that whole investigate the
seeking role and i find this.

286
00:21:48,50 --> 00:21:50,80
That's a real.

287
00:21:51,60 --> 00:21:55,11
It's not not new it's not even
aquarius was just the time

288
00:21:55,11 --> 00:21:58,97
that sort of just highlighted i mean that's
goes on throughout the ages in if you

289
00:21:58,97 --> 00:22:02,00
look back. Any really get into into

290
00:22:02,00 --> 00:22:05,92
that you have this sort
of line of thinking

291
00:22:05,93 --> 00:22:09,56
that goes right back in time since.

292
00:22:09,58 --> 00:22:13,29
Humans upon the surface or
have been that you know

293
00:22:13,29 --> 00:22:16,33
that development has created
the world we were in

294
00:22:16,33 --> 00:22:21,16
that sort of civil civilizational
thing is just part of the concepts

295
00:22:21,16 --> 00:22:27,91
that came out people to try
and. You know the sort of that.

296
00:22:28,71 --> 00:22:34,10
How we live with the earth
and the creatures around us.

297
00:22:34,11 --> 00:22:35,60
And then we have all these problems

298
00:22:35,60 --> 00:22:39,19
and then we are going to solve these
problems so needs certain things you have

299
00:22:39,96 --> 00:22:42,33
different and communication.

300
00:22:42,38 --> 00:22:43,58
You know communication

301
00:22:43,58 --> 00:22:48,17
and communication change like you have
the renaissance period which was a real

302
00:22:50,13 --> 00:22:53,70
change in our times in relation to the.

303
00:22:55,69 --> 00:22:59,88
That stands out because it was a radical
change with technology because i was also

304
00:22:59,88 --> 00:23:02,41
to do it. Mix mixing with technology and

305
00:23:02,42 --> 00:23:07,70
and the other became this sort
of technology that arrived in

306
00:23:07,70 --> 00:23:14,51
that time the printing press. And the.

307
00:23:14,53 --> 00:23:18,96
Building a whole lot of you know
architecture building and temples.

308
00:23:20,82 --> 00:23:24,35
And it was a sort of european sort
of connection going on the sort of

309
00:23:24,35 --> 00:23:29,43
internationalization
happening. To the post.

310
00:23:29,45 --> 00:23:34,57
Post roman empire times and sort of coming
out of the middle ages and so that this.

311
00:23:36,45 --> 00:23:39,58
Coming out over boyd so that there was
that that was a sort of the period

312
00:23:39,58 --> 00:23:41,30
that sort of and a spiritual awakening.

313
00:23:41,73 --> 00:23:45,86
This also spirituality is part of that
process that's something else that's that's.

314
00:23:46,23 --> 00:23:50,36
I found here in the emblem that a.

315
00:23:50,97 --> 00:23:54,89
There was investigation into alternative
spirituality there was a disillusionment

316
00:23:54,89 --> 00:24:00,45
chris did you do day. I mean basically we've
the people that came to this. Occurs.

317
00:24:00,71 --> 00:24:04,15
Were people from that sort
of a christian background

318
00:24:05,23 --> 00:24:08,48
and quite disillusioned because
that sort of really created.

319
00:24:08,71 --> 00:24:11,63
That world that that we rebelled against

320
00:24:11,63 --> 00:24:17,01
and sort of laws which sort of related to.

321
00:24:17,90 --> 00:24:22,46
Punishment and guilt and all that and
was sort of free ourselves from the.

322
00:24:23,09 --> 00:24:27,67
Annual so you had a christian is he also
vegetarianism the christians were part of

323
00:24:27,67 --> 00:24:32,83
that sort of culture that
that was around and they.

324
00:24:32,84 --> 00:24:33,07
And

325
00:24:33,07 --> 00:24:38,87
that was they were here in terms of they
brought their culture their culture here

326
00:24:38,87 --> 00:24:41,07
there was or can't i.

327
00:24:41,07 --> 00:24:45,71
Malay are spiritual groups of sort of new
age christian groups as well sort of

328
00:24:46,76 --> 00:24:47,84
and then buddhism

329
00:24:47,84 --> 00:24:53,34
and buddhism took off as quite strong after
chris first of all that's really came

330
00:24:54,09 --> 00:24:56,41
quite a strong thing as and
it was in my direction

331
00:24:57,28 --> 00:24:58,90
and i mean not even
really become a buddhist

332
00:24:58,90 --> 00:25:05,18
but i had a very they had a big impact
on my life is is being able to sit

333
00:25:05,18 --> 00:25:10,67
and i'm serve in a life you know you
know activity and become aware and

334
00:25:10,67 --> 00:25:17,64
that sharpen my awareness and still
point and yoga. That sort of bodily.

335
00:25:17,66 --> 00:25:20,50
Thing you know you know going
taichi all these things

336
00:25:20,50 --> 00:25:24,40
that you could do out here in this special
place this place just turned out to be

337
00:25:24,40 --> 00:25:26,88
so special with the rocks in the valley.

338
00:25:27,69 --> 00:25:30,56
You just create a special
precison energy about this place

339
00:25:30,56 --> 00:25:35,51
and then there's the aboriginal
connection with this place and.

340
00:25:35,53 --> 00:25:39,68
A lot of things just the mystery of this
place is something special about remember

341
00:25:39,68 --> 00:25:41,41
and i cut my finger on.

342
00:25:41,58 --> 00:25:44,08
I don't know anyone people
just put their things

343
00:25:44,08 --> 00:25:50,35
but i certainly have the magic
which sort of. It creates a.

344
00:25:51,19 --> 00:25:54,28
Inspiration.

345
00:25:55,56 --> 00:25:59,51
Yeah i yeah i guess it's good coming
back to the place and see the.

346
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:04,80
That the place is not being very radically
altered even though we're sort of

347
00:26:04,80 --> 00:26:08,05
fearing this going to be radical
alterations coming up now.

348
00:26:09,33 --> 00:26:15,88
But it's also that there is that.
There's a there's just. This people.

349
00:26:16,17 --> 00:26:20,73
There's all these hives and connections
are still there. If you look for it.

350
00:26:20,74 --> 00:26:24,42
It's around all those sort of
connections with all that accrue stuff

351
00:26:24,42 --> 00:26:33,89
that happened during aquarius first of
all is is around you know in the area.

352
00:26:37,83 --> 00:26:43,28
Oh well this is my little artistic
little do laws actually it's a sort of

353
00:26:43,28 --> 00:26:49,91
self-seeking. And in
externalizing it. In terms of.

354
00:26:53,36 --> 00:26:58,17
There's only bubbles right. Well zany
bubbles sort of grew out of the.

355
00:26:59,40 --> 00:27:05,35
Well after the queerest festival.
I just decided to change.

356
00:27:05,81 --> 00:27:11,55
You know create this character. Before
that i had a red pair of tights and and.

357
00:27:11,87 --> 00:27:16,33
You know i was i just had just
ordinary tights and dance things and.

358
00:27:16,94 --> 00:27:21,44
And you know the time traveller
was pretty much costumes and

359
00:27:21,44 --> 00:27:26,93
that terms of it was just
a part of the performance

360
00:27:26,93 --> 00:27:32,66
but now i wanted to do it as an environmental
piece by going to expand my ideas.

361
00:27:33,31 --> 00:27:36,79
And also as a clown character and
because it was sort of a community now

362
00:27:36,79 --> 00:27:41,38
and i just want to expand it that i
just came to my head just an idea

363
00:27:42,62 --> 00:27:43,93
and.

364
00:27:43,95 --> 00:27:46,55
So i just started developing and

365
00:27:47,45 --> 00:27:53,57
but it was in the 60s was
it was in early 70s 70 71.

366
00:27:55,09 --> 00:27:59,77
And 69. That was overseas. 69. And.

367
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,80
Just started to. Did a series of
paintings which were on the bubble.

368
00:28:06,67 --> 00:28:12,37
It was sort of drift bubbles drifting
through voids and and out of flames

369
00:28:12,37 --> 00:28:16,01
and into crevices and
coming out of clouds and.

370
00:28:16,53 --> 00:28:20,04
And and going through amoebas and.

371
00:28:21,28 --> 00:28:23,35
Just and different and getting the spirals

372
00:28:23,35 --> 00:28:27,86
and just the dots getting
into all these sort of.

373
00:28:27,88 --> 00:28:30,22
Other images you have to look at it

374
00:28:30,22 --> 00:28:35,22
and i just created this whole working
with with with time and space it was.

375
00:28:36,18 --> 00:28:42,85
And shape. And just exploring it
and just from that's around all.

376
00:28:43,52 --> 00:28:46,77
And if i draw in the ground or
you know sort of getting into

377
00:28:46,77 --> 00:28:49,76
that meditation of doing.

378
00:28:50,05 --> 00:28:55,95
Circles very simple and just the idea
spinning off one after the other.

379
00:28:55,97 --> 00:28:59,99
And so i did a series of canvases
in melbourne big canvases and.

380
00:29:01,18 --> 00:29:03,24
They never really completed because.

381
00:29:03,50 --> 00:29:08,36
Completely because i was part of a
community at the canterbury arts centre.

382
00:29:08,40 --> 00:29:12,30
We started a group of us broke away
from the pram factory carlton scene

383
00:29:12,30 --> 00:29:18,01
and wanted to start something away but it
sort of got lumbered with the council.

384
00:29:18,57 --> 00:29:25,26
So really you know. So it was
you know sort of a ritzy area.

385
00:29:25,62 --> 00:29:32,32
They couldn't hack us you know was
right aaron in. In the electorate of.

386
00:29:32,34 --> 00:29:33,78
Of.

387
00:29:34,83 --> 00:29:38,23
Prime minister of the time you
know one of the prime ministers

388
00:29:40,31 --> 00:29:47,23
and so you know sort of it sort of was a
whole lot of really you know sort of locks

389
00:29:47,23 --> 00:29:48,40
and closed

390
00:29:48,41 --> 00:29:52,65
that got more expensive than the council
wanted to rip this big theatre down into

391
00:29:52,65 --> 00:29:58,95
something else and we started a residence
group there and for the save save the.

392
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,97
But that that whole to beautiful
buildings there the old buildings.

393
00:30:05,71 --> 00:30:10,48
That's another story. But i was into
that to about this high rise stuff

394
00:30:10,48 --> 00:30:11,92
that was in carlton at the time

395
00:30:11,92 --> 00:30:18,47
and so i did paintings of all
building probably all. Environment.

396
00:30:20,34 --> 00:30:23,42
That was urban stuff.

397
00:30:23,43 --> 00:30:27,92
So i wasn't sure i thought.

398
00:30:29,45 --> 00:30:33,22
Well from that it was so well
that that developed later on

399
00:30:33,22 --> 00:30:35,20
and so there's only
bubbles was the character

400
00:30:36,13 --> 00:30:40,69
but i didn't plan to paint the shop fronts
and then when was that is just i had

401
00:30:40,69 --> 00:30:42,75
that and i. And i had.

402
00:30:44,01 --> 00:30:47,54
I didn't i was seven years
later when i came to nimbin

403
00:30:47,54 --> 00:30:53,55
and i was i was only
bubbles at the time. And.

404
00:30:54,43 --> 00:30:57,83
And. Graeme duffin actually
wrote to me. Melbourne.

405
00:30:58,13 --> 00:31:00,18
So so spending six months down here.

406
00:31:00,39 --> 00:31:06,07
Up here put put money into have exhibitions
and i did all buildings and places

407
00:31:06,07 --> 00:31:08,23
and and workshops in melbourne.

408
00:31:08,56 --> 00:31:15,36
So they had to hold connection family
connections in melbourne. And.

409
00:31:15,56 --> 00:31:18,42
Relationships and that sort of
thing so down in melbourne.

410
00:31:18,95 --> 00:31:25,91
And then i came up here to develop the
ideas in this sort of social experimental

411
00:31:26,95 --> 00:31:28,67
you know get together which even.
