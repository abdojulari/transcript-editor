00:00:02,22 --> 00:00:02,41
Well mr.

2
00:00:02,41 --> 00:00:06,39
Evans can you remember an amusing instant
incident that happened while you were on

3
00:00:06,39 --> 00:00:13,30
the bridge. Yes i can. Richard. There
you know there is no toilets there we

4
00:00:13,30 --> 00:00:19,55
go to get down to go to you mightn't
have time but the time you got down.

5
00:00:20,44 --> 00:00:27,09
So we'd have to take a brown paper bag or
a sheet of paper and if you want to do

6
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:32,75
a crap. Well you know to hide in the bracing
or in the chords and do what you want

7
00:00:32,75 --> 00:00:39,23
to do and then when you're done what
you wanted to do yet come out and

8
00:00:39,23 --> 00:00:46,10
throw it on the leaf
side that is the way the

9
00:00:46,10 --> 00:00:52,97
wind was blowing to the other side
but this particular day. My boss

10
00:00:52,97 --> 00:00:54,29
jemima your and mr.

11
00:00:54,29 --> 00:00:59,32
Hepworth were walking across. And that must
have been somebody out there that short

12
00:00:59,32 --> 00:01:04,56
this day. And when they'd
finished. What they were doing

13
00:01:06,48 --> 00:01:11,88
instead of intro on the bag to wended

14
00:01:13,65 --> 00:01:19,97
its allow it. A tour it up again as
the weather side and it blew over

15
00:01:20,69 --> 00:01:25,92
back onto the roadway and fell down as mr.

16
00:01:25,92 --> 00:01:30,36
Hip. Well and miss them. You know
walking across and flattened out like

17
00:01:30,36 --> 00:01:37,28
a pancake on the roadway. It wasn't
there anyway. You know you're not

18
00:01:37,28 --> 00:01:41,91
allowed to go down to the toilet while
you were on working on the arch. No you

19
00:01:41,91 --> 00:01:46,53
couldn't bear it. You wouldn't have
time to go down. Richard that it was

20
00:01:46,53 --> 00:01:51,41
a thing that you had to do everything when
you were up aloft. And there was no sort

21
00:01:51,41 --> 00:01:56,03
of toilet arrangements up there at all.
No toilets whatsoever. Only the blokes

22
00:01:56,03 --> 00:01:58,36
working down below. They've probably had

23
00:01:58,36 --> 00:02:04,61
a toilet but as far as working on the
on the heights of the bridge to take

24
00:02:04,61 --> 00:02:08,78
and do for yourself. Wherever you
could you know i think the change

25
00:02:08,78 --> 00:02:12,20
a bit since those days.
Thank you very much.
