1
00:00:04,89 --> 00:00:11,62
Hey. What you Mr Tom Evans and you worked as a rigger for Dorman long on the bridge.

2
00:00:11,67 --> 00:00:18,82
Didn't you do you remember being signed up for the job to a member getting the job.

3
00:00:20,01 --> 00:00:30,99
Well not a Met particular occasion but while Boss was Jimmy Moore and I happened to get in touch with him and.

4
00:00:31,01 --> 00:00:34,14
I got the job right away. Painter same and.

5
00:00:36,57 --> 00:00:43,15
So where did you start first of all well then you got me bait there now it's a long while ago.

6
00:00:43,17 --> 00:00:47,53
But it's been a few years though back going back into it.

7
00:00:48,41 --> 00:00:54,17
So you wouldn't expect a man to remember it or would you know not what do you remember where you started

8
00:00:54,17 --> 00:00:56,32
and what you did I remember.

9
00:00:57,35 --> 00:01:07,01
Then in charge of the paint is on the approach bands where we started out and they are a man at sight of a chap.

10
00:01:07,59 --> 00:01:14,15
That was on the north side that a year to be a bit of a smart alec and you remember

11
00:01:14,15 --> 00:01:19,7
when the trams were running across a jumped over the rail in front the tram got killed.

12
00:01:22,22 --> 00:01:29,93
You know what his name was I never can never remember it and I. But I was the first remained.

13
00:01:29,95 --> 00:01:38,11
To ever start the painters are on the approach planes and that took a lot of doing I don't mind telling you.

14
00:01:39,43 --> 00:01:47,03
Because I don't suppose they'd ever been up any more than about forty feet on a lather. And.

15
00:01:47,04 --> 00:01:49,92
It was quite a job to get them used to everything.

16
00:01:51,11 --> 00:01:58,11
I stand on the bridge in different parts and explain all the scenery around the place to hear them.

17
00:01:58,69 --> 00:02:04,62
And then I put them in a very strange chair and put a slipknot on them or something. If that was the case.

18
00:02:04,89 --> 00:02:07,39
They were going to lower themselves down.

19
00:02:07,41 --> 00:02:11,99
Well all that had to be gone through because they were new they only thing they had was ladders

20
00:02:11,99 --> 00:02:17,02
and paint brushes the scrapers would say for argument's sake.

21
00:02:17,04 --> 00:02:24,11
So they had never painted chips or certain anything big like that they'd never been well reluctantly spake

22
00:02:24,11 --> 00:02:33,49
and they'd never been up and the higher than the lather where put it that way but they were well

23
00:02:33,49 --> 00:02:35,85
and chaps they were good body a man.

24
00:02:36,89 --> 00:02:38,64
Well I suppose they were all nationalities

25
00:02:40,09 --> 00:02:45,47
and you had to agree with a lot of them that they did now understand that kind of work you know what I mean.

26
00:02:46,02 --> 00:02:52,19
But needed to say they shouldn't have been on the bridge in the first place

27
00:02:52,98 --> 00:03:00,81
and workers should have been doing their job because an ironworker is a would be doing chip and scraping and painting.

28
00:03:01,31 --> 00:03:07,42
And my going to good job of it. But painters and themselves they don't use years of paint scraper.

29
00:03:07,44 --> 00:03:14,58
And then dab the red lead on and go with the paint. But all in all there were.

30
00:03:15,41 --> 00:03:19,15
It was a pretty exciting job and a good job.

31
00:03:19,17 --> 00:03:27,18
You had everybody is why I've tried to get in to do and things on a job like that.

32
00:03:27,2 --> 00:03:35,93
But Sanders you had the know how it more or less went along with them and just show them what was what.

33
00:03:37,27 --> 00:03:39,26
What did you do after the approach spans.

34
00:03:39,4 --> 00:03:44,98
Well they approached that well all night job on the approach by

35
00:03:44,98 --> 00:03:52,12
and she was the same thing is way down on the outs which when dad from the seventh panel.

36
00:03:52,42 --> 00:03:55,79
So they ate panel is that right. The panel do the thing on it all together.

37
00:03:57,52 --> 00:04:04,53
And I had the same petition patients and their own all they hang is.

38
00:04:04,89 --> 00:04:10,64
The cause and the roadway underneath the roadway on top.

39
00:04:10,67 --> 00:04:16,51
No matter where you look I was there but did you work on the on the arch with the painters

40
00:04:16,51 --> 00:04:21,21
or were you working as a director or rigging right through the whole thing

41
00:04:22,38 --> 00:04:24,88
and regards to any particular job that was going.

42
00:04:26,02 --> 00:04:32,38
Besides paint is in that there was other jobs to do such as stage work and.

43
00:04:32,39 --> 00:04:40,27
Well whatever it is a part of the job you had and we had to be recognized.

44
00:04:40,27 --> 00:04:49,46
Whether it be in a Saemon but I did understand it that way. Lots of nuts and supplies just a bit down and.

45
00:04:49,89 --> 00:04:58,03
Stages to be built and what have you and who was it who was there to do it on the people that were capable of doing it.

46
00:04:59,3 --> 00:05:09,21
And did you work on the erection of the arch a toll on me while it was under construction on the whole thing right

47
00:05:09,21 --> 00:05:16,00
through round the doors point and including the approach

48
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:23,24
and chair they are going out from the Dawes point side to the middle

49
00:05:25,09 --> 00:05:31,32
and well do you remember exactly how they went about correcting the should self the panels the procedure.

50
00:05:31,38 --> 00:05:38,17
The whole thing you'd like me to tell you the Anchorage. Well they are just just the just the rigors job.

51
00:05:38,34 --> 00:05:40,93
The point of view of erecting from the rigors point of view.

52
00:05:40,94 --> 00:05:49,13
Well the rigorous point of view was that they had to go to anything that had to be down.

53
00:05:51,89 --> 00:05:58,26
They had to make the anchors for that bridge to go out in the first place. And you know the doors point then.

54
00:06:00,55 --> 00:06:16,15
Where the main span the. A lot going on that doors point and at one particular time was an old gun mounting place.

55
00:06:17,5 --> 00:06:24,4
Well they had to make an angry each there to hold that bridge up even on the north shore side they had to do the same

56
00:06:24,4 --> 00:06:24,92
thing.

57
00:06:26,04 --> 00:06:37,26
They'd done on the South Side that was they get a proper length and the anchorage was down about thirty to forty feet.

58
00:06:37,28 --> 00:06:46,4
And that was dug out of saying the stone and the same stone at all. Recesses OK I understand.

59
00:06:46,42 --> 00:06:57,32
Parts going from one side they are there where that the wires were in laid in that particular angry

60
00:06:58,68 --> 00:07:05,12
and the very thing that just went up to about supports that held the bridge in the first place.

61
00:07:05,33 --> 00:07:07,8
Otherwise the damned thing would have collapsed

62
00:07:07,8 --> 00:07:15,29
and it might have it just like put new broom in trying to stand a broom up in the middle of the floor and fall over.

63
00:07:15,29 --> 00:07:15,6
Wouldn't it.

64
00:07:16,7 --> 00:07:24,93
That Were you involved with the tunnels the increased tunnels at all how that was all done by a library like people

65
00:07:24,93 --> 00:07:28,28
that worked on the masonry and that.

66
00:07:28,3 --> 00:07:34,17
You might find a few other fellows that worked on the masonry did you hear say found were people who work on the

67
00:07:34,17 --> 00:07:36,6
masonry just said you know they named it all.

68
00:07:36,66 --> 00:07:46,01
Harry Harry Powell I think it is I'm not quite sure he was one of them but we got a few of the most alive

69
00:07:46,01 --> 00:07:50,73
but what I particular want to know was what was your job on the actual you know.

70
00:07:51,3 --> 00:07:57,2
If if you were involved with the picture show to appear a little in the cradle.

71
00:07:58,04 --> 00:08:03,13
Well we're going up to an erection constructional cry out that they were the constructional crowd

72
00:08:03,13 --> 00:08:04,19
and you weren't with them.

73
00:08:04,89 --> 00:08:14,37
Partly at times with them but not all looked on my mind ya been looking out the paint is doing all their stage work.

74
00:08:14,95 --> 00:08:22,85
And then as you might know it is on the chairs for crying is that right.

75
00:08:24,9 --> 00:08:32,01
This take trains on each side on the no doors point side and on the. Note shore side.

76
00:08:32,38 --> 00:08:41,1
Well then we had a big stage went down and ate the roadway remember that one. And then we had.

77
00:08:41,86 --> 00:08:49,87
Stages going along the pedestrians for so all in all there were mechanical things that were put out there

78
00:08:49,87 --> 00:08:52,9
but then there was a lot of rope stages

79
00:08:52,9 --> 00:09:00,32
and different stages had to be put up in the know all that you had to be versatile with all ours kind of things.

80
00:09:00,34 --> 00:09:09,6
To remember any accidents on the bridge. Do I remember them. Well remember Kelly as I mentioned a while back that.

81
00:09:10,87 --> 00:09:13,34
Kelly one day drop this banner in the harbor

82
00:09:14,96 --> 00:09:19,81
and it turned around said to May are supposed to man to be going over there.

83
00:09:19,91 --> 00:09:24,87
One of these days like the Spanish don't be damn silly.

84
00:09:25,32 --> 00:09:31,64
Well it wasn't long after I had telly fell off the desk into a walk.

85
00:09:31,66 --> 00:09:43,34
And what do or can I say any more than hit the water with a splash and he sent his prior up about ninety eight.

86
00:09:43,61 --> 00:09:47,51
Did you see him at or. Now just heard of him coming out.

87
00:09:48,14 --> 00:09:57,45
And he swam from where he fell into the punt where Faulkner and others that were dog went down Main.

88
00:09:57,47 --> 00:10:04,68
Sam were going to dive in and poke Cally a out but he swam that to the bide.

89
00:10:04,89 --> 00:10:07,87
And they managed to pull him on to the barge.

90
00:10:08,63 --> 00:10:22,09
And then they only thing about that Faulkner that was killed and mentioned what I know about the the plight.

91
00:10:22,11 --> 00:10:27,09
But will you just tell us tell us a story of how fault and was killed. Yes such what I'm doing now.

92
00:10:28,33 --> 00:10:37,97
Now as they approach as the chords went out. They had strengthen and plates on both sides.

93
00:10:37,98 --> 00:10:44,75
And they used about each section. They played about it onto each section.

94
00:10:44,77 --> 00:10:50,36
To strengthen the bridge as it went there because it had to have all that support.

95
00:10:50,43 --> 00:10:56,26
Otherwise it would have collapsed because it was only held up by nuts and bolts and rivets.

96
00:10:58,2 --> 00:11:04,03
But what was happening up on the top of that cord I can't realize or say

97
00:11:04,8 --> 00:11:09,9
but I have some mentorship ation that they were trying to put a shackle in that plate

98
00:11:11,15 --> 00:11:22,28
and lower it down with the crying and down below Faulkner we're sitting on a gurney straddle legged dog with this guy.

99
00:11:23,28 --> 00:11:34,56
And there's the plight came down so he was dogging it in between go down to the pond collect them on the harbor

100
00:11:36,17 --> 00:11:38,98
and somehow or another.

101
00:11:41,3 --> 00:11:47,2
There's plight got out of control and it came down like a snake

102
00:11:48,52 --> 00:11:53,21
and hit all of Ridgeway that's the hangers on the way down.

103
00:11:54,68 --> 00:12:03,07
And came down and struck crush Faulkner's family artery and the leg was hanging Loesch.

104
00:12:04,89 --> 00:12:12,17
And I was the first one to get over the riot and the leg and steady him he was quite conscious the whole time.

105
00:12:14,43 --> 00:12:22,73
Well of bursting out down. We couldn't get a tonic eye on each leg but I for a stretch. Oh.

106
00:12:22,75 --> 00:12:26,35
Well we got him on the stretcher assistance of others.

107
00:12:26,36 --> 00:12:33,1
Give me a hand to lift him over the rail on the roadway and we took him to lift.

108
00:12:33,28 --> 00:12:38,34
We had a lip at the back a divorce point and but we band when we got into the lift.

109
00:12:38,54 --> 00:12:41,03
We couldn't get the stretcher and it was too long.

110
00:12:42,96 --> 00:12:49,83
Then we took him up on the big crane on that with a small crane in front of it.

111
00:12:49,86 --> 00:12:55,72
We took him up with a small crane and then way back a whole lot down to the dollars point

112
00:12:55,72 --> 00:13:00,81
and where we lowered the book and I down with the crime

113
00:13:01,96 --> 00:13:10,99
and then transshipped him from that crane to working steam cry and it was on the dollars point

114
00:13:10,99 --> 00:13:15,51
and from then our I remember it was one of his mates ran to him.

115
00:13:16,69 --> 00:13:22,91
And that was that it took him to sit in the hospital but I think he died out too. It's about three o'clock.

116
00:13:23,12 --> 00:13:23,9
I mean out the moon.

117
00:13:25,7 --> 00:13:32,77
You know that's all I know in regards to poor old Faulkner Yes here is Thomas three a clock in the afternoon seems to

118
00:13:32,77 --> 00:13:44,88
be correct version from the from the morgue records as well though. It's a funny thing about Mrs Faulkner.

119
00:13:44,9 --> 00:13:54,2
I remember coming down whether it was that day or days afterwards. With a baby and their arms.

120
00:13:56,17 --> 00:14:03,07
Now mind you have a good memory to think of all this. Regards the baby been in Mrs Ball in his arms.

121
00:14:04,89 --> 00:14:11,13
But I never had a chance to speak to her but I know she spoke to several other workers.

122
00:14:12,61 --> 00:14:19,14
And it's a peculiar thing I go to Reagan jobber C.S.R.

123
00:14:19,14 --> 00:14:28,99
Roads and like all time you march stand and have a bit of a yarn while you were able.

124
00:14:29,01 --> 00:14:39,59
And a young fellow came along with a part of paint and a brush in his hand. This is twenty years afterwards or more.

125
00:14:39,68 --> 00:14:46,03
I JUST BECAUSE THEY COULD I was a child hand that particular time.

126
00:14:47,45 --> 00:14:55,52
And as you came up and approached is and got near it as I said to him I was what your name.

127
00:14:56,66 --> 00:15:06,38
Is my name is Potter ISIS book no aces Yes. I said Joe Pa they get killed on the Harbor Bridge.

128
00:15:07,99 --> 00:15:19,04
He says Yes well I said I'm one of the men that went to your father's assistance and that's that. If you get me here.

129
00:15:19,06 --> 00:15:21,21
Thank you very much to member any other accidents.

130
00:15:24,51 --> 00:15:34,99
Yes I do remember one very bad action there was a fellow named Campbell Jimmy Campbell.

131
00:15:35,75 --> 00:15:40,66
Well Jimmy was it an Englishman. And his quiet versatile regular.

132
00:15:42,34 --> 00:15:51,06
And quite a decent kind of a fellow and quite conscientious every time he was doing a job.

133
00:15:51,08 --> 00:15:59,07
Well he worked per the masonry that was going up most of the time during stage work and that

134
00:16:00,48 --> 00:16:04,81
and as that stage work went out.

135
00:16:06,2 --> 00:16:09,9
And the stone work went out the years a lot of acid because lending it down

136
00:16:11,76 --> 00:16:17,73
but make the preparations for cleaning the list down work down.

137
00:16:20,02 --> 00:16:28,83
Campbell had to put some girders show the port Howards if you remember on the top of the pile and.

138
00:16:28,85 --> 00:16:30,94
And it put a stake up there.

139
00:16:32,1 --> 00:16:41,41
I can give you the length of the stake somewhere about ten twelve foot and they had bog guy on that stake.

140
00:16:43,31 --> 00:16:51,47
They were going down the road wage where they were angry. But whatever happened regardless of this action.

141
00:16:51,48 --> 00:17:01,4
I don't know whether one of the guys became loose all the way in got them to that.

142
00:17:01,42 --> 00:17:07,12
Why that more or less push they go over an angle.

143
00:17:09,86 --> 00:17:12,58
I'm not precisely clear about really what happened

144
00:17:12,58 --> 00:17:21,11
but I don't know what happened to the steak that Campbell was putting out.

145
00:17:22,41 --> 00:17:25,25
It fell over the top with a masonry

146
00:17:27,29 --> 00:17:33,14
and of Jimmy Campbell had to run the way the stick was falling he would have been all right.

147
00:17:34,14 --> 00:17:42,98
But he ran back the opposite way and got underneath right

148
00:17:44,26 --> 00:17:55,38
and ball to do him over the break wary hit the stonework on the wide and just missed and the electrician work

149
00:17:55,38 --> 00:18:04,85
and on the hangers it you know is where that train is run across. Now. Pardon me body when he power.

150
00:18:04,89 --> 00:18:11,93
All wriggly inside underneath the roadway and Bell and other hundred or so odd plate down below.

151
00:18:13,17 --> 00:18:29,26
But what happened with regard to the Reminds of Jimmy had a big claim down up the stonework and my boss Jimmy Muir.

152
00:18:29,28 --> 00:18:33,19
Said to me she was going to do about it.

153
00:18:33,9 --> 00:18:38,19
Well I said went out to put a tackle up there and send a man up to clean it down.

154
00:18:40,3 --> 00:18:50,00
So I say let me get a bottle of whisky and give that chap a drink and eyes who are left to lash him in the chair

155
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:58,34
and take him up so that we're down and then he went out and he done the job but

156
00:18:58,35 --> 00:19:08,34
when he finished the job I said to Jimmy Muir you can't do it. Use that rope any more fires that are.

157
00:19:09,89 --> 00:19:14,97
Well I said it's probably part of acid and I say for years that again.

158
00:19:15,52 --> 00:19:24,64
Sam be the one that's going to have a now and next and with that. Well as you what we're going to do about it.

159
00:19:24,74 --> 00:19:30,01
Well I say the best thing we could do is get some kerosene and put it over the rope

160
00:19:30,01 --> 00:19:34,91
and set fire to it so that was another job that I remember very well

161
00:19:36,71 --> 00:19:41,6
but that's as far as I'm concerned with Jimmy Campbell

162
00:19:41,6 --> 00:19:50,76
and if one of those things that was a sad turn out to find a man like him.

163
00:19:53,59 --> 00:19:58,85
There is he's lived as he did but when you come to look at things in the rigging game.

164
00:19:58,86 --> 00:20:10,82
That's at thing you take on yourself but you must. Be a bit of a contortionist at all. Con. And a bad.

165
00:20:11,63 --> 00:20:18,4
Walk across it is no matter what the dimensions are that is so what's it going to take it in your own hands.

166
00:20:18,47 --> 00:20:26,6
What you're about to do but if you're conscientious and you can do that class of work.

167
00:20:26,62 --> 00:20:33,14
Well walking on God is just as good as walking on the ground down below it didn't make any difference if that was your

168
00:20:33,14 --> 00:20:40,16
job and you had to do it. So that's there. Thank you very much for telling us about that.

169
00:20:40,3 --> 00:20:44,98
Do you remember any amusing incidents that happened on the bridge to put on a lighter vein.

170
00:20:46,27 --> 00:21:02,82
Well nothing like well line that we had an amusing kind of cartoonish there and a puddle Adra another from the roadway.

171
00:21:03,54 --> 00:21:06,24
And they approached by and they had.

172
00:21:07,69 --> 00:21:09,00
Every cell going out there

173
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:15,29
or somebody else a new ISP ain't been splattered all over the place I remember that as a matter of fact I've got that

174
00:21:15,29 --> 00:21:21,04
photograph here but I don't know where it is just the moment. Now I can't think of any.

175
00:21:21,48 --> 00:21:31,25
Oh yes I do they only thing I remember that could be comical atmosphere.

176
00:21:32,58 --> 00:21:37,46
Where is when the great went across the bridge. But unfortunately though.

177
00:21:41,23 --> 00:21:48,7
We were in the procession that day we went from dollars point across the North Sydney.

178
00:21:48,72 --> 00:21:51,3
But you could just imagine where most of us spend each step.

179
00:21:51,34 --> 00:21:57,2
We've been used up in the past but that incident with the group. Well.

180
00:21:59,47 --> 00:22:07,13
Jacked language than mine man to cut that bridge and the. As you head the story or read the story.

181
00:22:07,69 --> 00:22:09,72
The degree got in first.

182
00:22:11,21 --> 00:22:18,68
But I'm sorry for what happened to him Now you got a good kick in the backside and hold up the horse and.

183
00:22:18,7 --> 00:22:22,27
What happened there. After that I don't remember but.

184
00:22:22,29 --> 00:22:30,07
I never same the incident but what I heard about it is wiped out of what I'm telling you. And.

185
00:22:30,09 --> 00:22:35,74
Can do you remember any other particular things about the bridge you remember the way it was remember the conditions to

186
00:22:35,74 --> 00:22:40,82
member the union thing about. The way the working conditions were competitors I do.

187
00:22:41,16 --> 00:22:45,27
Regards regards the bridge in that respect.

188
00:22:48,9 --> 00:23:00,22
Our money on the approach Bandra six pound a week and now a high money and then when we got out on the bridge.

189
00:23:01,39 --> 00:23:06,45
It was seven pounds a week and now hide money.

190
00:23:06,47 --> 00:23:19,25
So you took your life in their hand whether or not for that screw that we got but I suppose they are just the same

191
00:23:19,25 --> 00:23:24,3
when you come to look at it now that money was small with no money.

192
00:23:29,48 --> 00:23:35,92
Something that you had to be thankful for that you had a job to do that.

193
00:23:38,33 --> 00:23:40,58
No I can't think of anything more than that

194
00:23:40,58 --> 00:23:52,34
but the main table that got paid for their work was a crane drivers they got bought in pound a week so I don't know any

195
00:23:52,34 --> 00:23:56,97
more than. Do you remember the on workers me Union in those days. It's true.

196
00:23:58,71 --> 00:24:07,77
As I was the Member for that as a matter of Baghdad. An appointed delegate in parts of it.

197
00:24:09,28 --> 00:24:12,99
And still holding my own job was to charge him.

198
00:24:13,77 --> 00:24:23,48
But oh yes I think more or less through all my regen profession was still an hour

199
00:24:23,48 --> 00:24:31,1
and work till I went in the gas company where I was a regular still and.

200
00:24:32,3 --> 00:24:39,52
A lot of highs today over there in those gas howlers where I worked around the circumference of them

201
00:24:39,52 --> 00:24:48,94
and never had any hand rails a row to hang on to it just walked around as they are walking on the footpath.

202
00:24:48,96 --> 00:24:53,48
But there were difficult problems in regards to that particular job.

203
00:24:54,85 --> 00:25:01,58
Yes I suppose all in all no matter where I've been a monkey.

204
00:25:03,17 --> 00:25:17,46
But often I was told I had now tiled But I spoke of other privileges in life was my apprenticeship to see.

205
00:25:17,48 --> 00:25:25,61
And then they carry on until they either came and I would say MN. Where you had to save your apprenticeship.

206
00:25:25,63 --> 00:25:33,36
I think that had a lot to do with my climbing. But I have very much.

207
00:25:33,51 --> 00:25:41,25
Regrets as far as my knees are concerned and I think all that climbing has got a lot to do with what.

208
00:25:42,96 --> 00:25:44,62
Pains and aches that I have with them.

209
00:25:46,36 --> 00:25:47,55
Tell me when do you go to sea

210
00:25:47,55 --> 00:25:54,42
when you were very young boy we do the first ward only for the night in right through the first four years.

211
00:25:55,49 --> 00:26:04,04
Yes I was an old condors transport. Crosas of thank goodness.

212
00:26:04,89 --> 00:26:07,98
Part of the whole lot of it like to mention from time to time.

213
00:26:09,52 --> 00:26:14,55
And we were in the navy your merchant ships well then you combine the two I was in Bahrain.

214
00:26:16,91 --> 00:26:24,9
The Navy and the merchant navy. Were you born in Australia now that I was not narrow.

215
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:35,93
I bet you couldn't tell me where I belong to. Were you able to tell me now now now.

216
00:26:35,95 --> 00:26:44,61
An Irishman born the place called Dublin. And I've been doubling up ever since.

217
00:26:46,88 --> 00:26:49,89
That's all I could tell you in that part but when did you come to Australia.

218
00:26:50,28 --> 00:27:00,99
Well though I came back with the last lot of numeric Caledonian.

219
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:05,07
And we show a New Zealand dish

220
00:27:06,56 --> 00:27:13,21
and the last bunch of astrologers as far as I can remember that was in nineteen nineteen.

221
00:27:13,23 --> 00:27:19,02
Well between now and in eighteen nineteen nineteen. Now.

222
00:27:21,6 --> 00:27:27,18
Where did you work first were well the say and where they only played.

223
00:27:27,2 --> 00:27:29,83
And so how did you come to get on the bridge when

224
00:27:29,83 --> 00:27:37,13
when did you leave the C O O round of at twenty seven nine hundred twenty seven.

225
00:27:37,15 --> 00:27:45,22
And I think that was around about the time I think that I. Now I think I went out on it went out in the country then.

226
00:27:45,24 --> 00:27:58,74
Belling now is Bob and concrete silos and oh I forget now just when I came back.

227
00:28:00,42 --> 00:28:04,24
And it was then long before I went on the bridge again. But.

228
00:28:08,41 --> 00:28:11,32
Do you remember what happened to you when you finished on the bridge.

229
00:28:11,39 --> 00:28:16,83
Did you get a job straightaway Oh we had to work on it all now there you've come to a particular question

230
00:28:18,39 --> 00:28:29,74
and a very awkward thing it was the thing that while I was on the bridge that one thing that I used to take now is of

231
00:28:29,74 --> 00:28:41,86
no matter where I work. Odd always see a crowd of maimed and taken there.

232
00:28:43,41 --> 00:28:51,2
But for the love of million of you more hate that thank God I didn't know what the hell a bloody dollar was

233
00:28:52,94 --> 00:28:55,92
but they tell me they were all that was out of work and drawing there

234
00:28:57,38 --> 00:29:01,64
but little did I ever know ever think that I was going to be on the go.

235
00:29:03,31 --> 00:29:12,46
And then some happened while we were in the parade from Doris point. To the north side.

236
00:29:14,22 --> 00:29:19,06
Now in a procession that bind all the people lined up along the route wouldn't do.

237
00:29:21,00 --> 00:29:23,97
And I remember a few girls of many girls.

238
00:29:24,63 --> 00:29:25,27
Saying

239
00:29:25,27 --> 00:29:33,73
and out while we were walking in the procession he'll soon be on the dollar of my letter that I ever realized I was

240
00:29:33,73 --> 00:29:43,75
ever going to be on to it but I don't know if it is the most main this thing ever.

241
00:29:43,77 --> 00:29:45,29
I thought of was that old

242
00:29:47,29 --> 00:29:54,88
and I tell you it was hard to find money to put in the blooming gas the to do a better cook and

243
00:29:55,78 --> 00:30:07,43
and watch your dead get for cooking. Five bob awake and all the rest was in coupons was. All the rest was in coupon.

244
00:30:07,45 --> 00:30:11,46
And then when I got my first young by the.

245
00:30:12,39 --> 00:30:13,86
Party job to get milk for him

246
00:30:15,51 --> 00:30:22,65
and the most you got the children in them days read about oh it's part of it by above a fortnight they would get much

247
00:30:22,65 --> 00:30:32,08
more. But things resent a hell of a state. And paying their rent was one of the hardest jobs.

248
00:30:33,54 --> 00:30:41,15
I remember one time they live in a residence and.

249
00:30:41,99 --> 00:30:47,87
We couldn't afford to pay the rent and needed to say I was taken to court over it.

250
00:30:49,72 --> 00:30:53,59
I suppose they would charge me at the back of my neck if they could.

251
00:30:53,61 --> 00:31:04,16
But when I got to the place caught my eye and so the judge was poverty circumstances.

252
00:31:06,21 --> 00:31:12,34
So I got another three months later of life and that's the only thing I remember about that

253
00:31:12,34 --> 00:31:18,53
but the dough although But how did you pay your rent. You know if you had no money coming in.

254
00:31:18,54 --> 00:31:26,15
You had only the only the coupons for you for your money. That's what I say you had to let the landlord go.

255
00:31:26,17 --> 00:31:31,42
But so did you have a pain in the end. Well I don't ever remember paying it.

256
00:31:32,64 --> 00:31:38,18
I think more or less the idea was I'm in a light which they call it.

257
00:31:38,2 --> 00:31:45,6
But everybody on the dole couldn't have had any money to pay the rent. Oh well if you take things into consideration.

258
00:31:46,6 --> 00:31:56,74
One of the worst thing is that I ever could remember and I just wanted. Out of the conditions I would live in and.

259
00:31:56,75 --> 00:32:03,42
Often thought well there must be thousands like me you know what I mean. But one of the engines I remember.

260
00:32:04,89 --> 00:32:14,64
I went down to Hoskins and stale that speech pay. Where I went down. There's a charge ten rigger also.

261
00:32:14,66 --> 00:32:19,29
And I was on the building of a hundred seventy five ton crane down there.

262
00:32:21,73 --> 00:32:35,65
But from that crane to other jobs that had to be done. Putting construction were sheds up and one thing in the other.

263
00:32:36,61 --> 00:32:44,32
When I have they got what I wanted done. There was no further pity for you. There is close on about.

264
00:32:44,49 --> 00:32:55,86
So YOU thousand workers put up the Clairton riggers and boilermakers and what have you. And back on the dollar again.

265
00:32:58,78 --> 00:33:08,73
And why the thing used there was we had to write a pushbike those days and we went around the different shops.

266
00:33:08,75 --> 00:33:12,53
Begging for a loaf of bread and sausages and.

267
00:33:13,3 --> 00:33:19,11
Better state govt bound to some whatever good eight to try and achieve your purpose to live.

268
00:33:20,18 --> 00:33:29,94
But it was a hell of a state of A and no one can believe at that particular time.

269
00:33:33,28 --> 00:33:41,78
That desperation was at its lowest and you had a chart of those times with one or two children to do one child

270
00:33:41,78 --> 00:33:55,67
and two children in a matter of fact. And it was quite a job to try and get different things. For those children.

271
00:33:56,79 --> 00:34:03,92
Milt and different thing. One style went to K. Street. If you know where K. Street is there.

272
00:34:04,89 --> 00:34:14,34
And I seen the specialist and he ordered three bottle of milk a week.

273
00:34:16,71 --> 00:34:24,15
And when you went down to get the damn dowel all I give you would one bottle. So you could tell what sort of a fight.

274
00:34:24,17 --> 00:34:32,62
I put out to get that tray bottle. As a matter of fact the Custom House whether that was a help the potman some of it.

275
00:34:34,61 --> 00:34:38,81
I went in there and the question was asked what do you want to hear.

276
00:34:38,91 --> 00:34:49,18
I want to say that help inspect the other doctor that helped our regard extra milk. And food for my child.

277
00:34:51,62 --> 00:34:59,07
Oh I see you won't you can't saying well I shall not live in it like I do seem. He said You'll have to get out of it.

278
00:34:59,14 --> 00:35:04,08
I'll get out. I'll get a place for you. Well I say go ahead go and get the place.

279
00:35:04,6 --> 00:35:10,82
And I put the baby on the counter and I said you can look out there him now if you get the place.

280
00:35:10,84 --> 00:35:20,83
So I needed to say I got a victory. I got three dollars remote back. And you had to fight for every bit you got.

281
00:35:20,86 --> 00:35:32,38
Well I think it did because under the supervision. There was not much that you got out of life.

282
00:35:33,26 --> 00:35:39,92
But the hardest part about it was I was quite a young conscientious fellow

283
00:35:41,79 --> 00:35:52,39
and I would have done anything to get good to do any job that was going but no not in US way to life.

284
00:35:52,42 --> 00:36:04,39
You couldn't even. I doubt very much. If you are allowed to hold of the pressure. If they could have stopped that.

285
00:36:04,89 --> 00:36:17,92
Had done that. He had died of oxygen but needed to say. It was a pretty tough time right through.

286
00:36:18,54 --> 00:36:22,7
So when you get the next job after the after that period of unemployment.

287
00:36:23,87 --> 00:36:30,41
Well I think then while that while that procedure was going on being out of work.

288
00:36:33,26 --> 00:36:39,97
Our live brand new town them die and I haven't met biting spirit to try

289
00:36:39,97 --> 00:36:50,44
and get something I went down to the government to have some McQuarrie straight.

290
00:36:51,79 --> 00:37:02,81
And I say in one of the women politicians down May and age. What do you want. I say I want to job.

291
00:37:03,83 --> 00:37:10,78
Asian good and a man they want and Serge board and when I got down there was a bad two thousand blokes might for a job.

292
00:37:10,87 --> 00:37:22,44
So there was no job there going. But one of the things I do want to say. As regards politicians.

293
00:37:22,46 --> 00:37:35,5
We put in for extra money when we worked on the bridge and to get that money politicians were concerned.

294
00:37:35,52 --> 00:37:41,63
And they had to come up on the bridge to find out what while I was getting extra money.

295
00:37:42,41 --> 00:37:46,24
And how this is the funniest part about the story relating.

296
00:37:47,11 --> 00:37:56,09
I don't think politicians it will cross that R.'s go it is not near as way to live. You know we had to do.

297
00:37:57,41 --> 00:38:04,82
We had to go and build a wooden platform across the roadway. And they you know how they got out there bang.

298
00:38:04,89 --> 00:38:22,1
Crawled out on all was made to say out the time we found we got it. Fifteen. Bob away gagged in a pie show ever.

299
00:38:22,11 --> 00:38:28,73
The been a politician was asked to build the bridge. It wouldn't be built yet. RUSH.

300
00:38:29,89 --> 00:38:34,65
Tell me do you remember seeing Bredfield or any sort any of the big wigs around.

301
00:38:34,66 --> 00:38:43,72
Oh yes we used to have a bit of a young man again. Dr Bradbury was a little out of very high ball boy.

302
00:38:45,07 --> 00:38:55,54
And is he would a very big man when I think one of the biggest med ever seen and I've seen the whole lot of them

303
00:38:55,54 --> 00:38:59,94
but they used to go up and around today. Oh no. And it's had no fear.

304
00:39:00,07 --> 00:39:09,42
It's only went wherever and the same way with what was the other bloke we mentioned the name just a while ago.

305
00:39:10,23 --> 00:39:14,54
You know. Oh he'd go anywhere to read.

306
00:39:16,32 --> 00:39:22,47
Do you remember the chief construction engineer Hipwell well very well yes yes do.

307
00:39:22,49 --> 00:39:30,42
Matter of fact I've still got my old bad. Brass my dad and I you for your time.

308
00:39:30,64 --> 00:39:34,47
Keep it up as you know what I mean it picked it up in the morning

309
00:39:34,47 --> 00:39:40,52
and put it back on of a night time I've still got it here somewhere. I don't know where it is I'm at the fact.

310
00:39:43,45 --> 00:39:50,56
Did you get the can but to puppet when the darts was joined now that's another question. I never thought of at bat.

311
00:39:52,05 --> 00:39:58,47
We got eight Canberra Florence. But little did I know then.

312
00:39:59,69 --> 00:40:06,77
Regardless they value of them to day invite in on the value of the die. Yeah there's still got my money's worth.

313
00:40:07,96 --> 00:40:09,24
There where the thousand dollars.

314
00:40:09,99 --> 00:40:11,77
I believe I'm a part sure about that

315
00:40:11,77 --> 00:40:20,76
but you know the pay our hotel where we went over them which are the that alarms on the counter

316
00:40:21,82 --> 00:40:35,97
and we drank beer for the strength of what they gave me I can bare floor and a bronze medallion a bronze medallion

317
00:40:37,51 --> 00:40:48,49
and A Now Mo bad to wear in Abbottabad consisted of the word should me have a bridge page

318
00:40:48,49 --> 00:40:52,78
and I've still got that as a matter of fact.

319
00:40:54,72 --> 00:41:05,47
But one of the instances I tried to overcome which to try and get some souvenirs. And I lost a quid trying to get them.

320
00:41:05,48 --> 00:41:10,03
And that was the train that came across the bridge.

321
00:41:10,76 --> 00:41:18,14
I got the driver to slow down and I put the money on the Ryo so they get BLACK IN THE MONEY AT barmy.

322
00:41:18,72 --> 00:41:28,74
But Natixis I add of a quid I only got two bob back. I intended to ours they cry and the engine driver's name.

323
00:41:30,48 --> 00:41:36,03
And I've got all about it. But that was another instance.

324
00:41:37,87 --> 00:41:43,26
But oh I've seen very funny things happen to remember them all.

325
00:41:43,45 --> 00:41:49,82
Well that's why the thing to have done too bad so I have I done very well.

326
00:41:50,16 --> 00:42:00,4
Do you remember a bloke known Bluey would had the name is merely a to me but there was a chap there French

327
00:42:00,4 --> 00:42:09,17
and Froggy we used to call him did he have a mouthful of gold. Well then I can just go back on that time.

328
00:42:09,18 --> 00:42:16,27
It's quite a you could have had them. But I know he was a bit of a monkey also those Frenchmen.

329
00:42:16,29 --> 00:42:20,14
And I think if he can go back if he could remember

330
00:42:21,47 --> 00:42:27,28
when there was a fire took place on the Harbor Bridge one of the stages went on fire.

331
00:42:28,31 --> 00:42:35,3
They took the cooker they used to call them days where is the fellow that cooked the rivets

332
00:42:37,05 --> 00:42:39,00
and I suppose he thought he put the fire out.

333
00:42:39,15 --> 00:42:48,48
But when he knocked out that night better wind came up and start the fire going again.

334
00:42:48,51 --> 00:42:54,45
So needless to say there was chain blocks on the stage and ropes and everything.

335
00:42:54,47 --> 00:43:04,95
And the monkey went up when he tried to put it all out but at the time he got up there it all collapsed.

336
00:43:05,97 --> 00:43:13,43
But one of the things about staging would lead to that particular incident do you remember a bloke named chair's HAYES

337
00:43:16,26 --> 00:43:17,62
Well the night you mean rings a bell

338
00:43:17,62 --> 00:43:27,66
but not to go back to their notes just where that particular incident of a fire hurt so that you supposed to go to the

339
00:43:27,66 --> 00:43:36,43
fire brigade up there. Well now I don't know. Never in your head of a passport. Had it been a bit of a job wouldn't.

340
00:43:36,45 --> 00:43:40,38
Take There might have been our getting a pump on the roadway

341
00:43:40,38 --> 00:43:43,36
and pump the water out harbor if they could have got up at five.

342
00:43:43,63 --> 00:43:49,92
But then again it would have had to have the road by laid down.

343
00:43:51,26 --> 00:44:01,65
That one other thing huge Do you know about what the roadway belt of on the bridge. You don't know.

344
00:44:02,96 --> 00:44:09,59
Well I know but the people. Other than no other new.

345
00:44:11,12 --> 00:44:17,45
Well I was going to ask you the question in regards to what you thought of a Obs You know what I mean.

346
00:44:17,47 --> 00:44:26,06
And whether it is stone of ash belts or well I thought it was concrete with ash felt on top. Well that's right.

347
00:44:27,73 --> 00:44:39,97
It was laid out from the gas company but to lay it down with care and cement.

348
00:44:39,99 --> 00:44:48,64
There was a lot of open ans on the channeling of the bridge there that had to be take the showers the concrete wouldn't

349
00:44:48,64 --> 00:44:53,31
fall down over the paint. It's already been painted on the need.

350
00:44:53,32 --> 00:45:01,78
And the respect to dollars from going on that anybody could give them an idea to stop that paint that can't create from

351
00:45:02,81 --> 00:45:03,85
going down on the paint

352
00:45:03,85 --> 00:45:14,3
and they are like to think what it was fifty dollars fifty quid just to put on the pallet is mentioned.

353
00:45:14,71 --> 00:45:22,32
So you get a light canvas and tear strips and paint it with red LED which done the job.

354
00:45:22,34 --> 00:45:31,78
And then the guy in Beijing know about the roadway rises arises.

355
00:45:31,82 --> 00:45:36,83
Can you tell us about the road where exactly what is the principle of The Rise and Fall of the town.

356
00:45:38,16 --> 00:45:46,02
Well there's no for the rising bar would have been bad one hundred forty feet that sound. All right.

357
00:45:46,98 --> 00:45:51,46
Most people wouldn't think that they're when they're traveling back with employers across there.

358
00:45:52,15 --> 00:45:57,97
I think it's paid would think it would be flat wouldn't I.

359
00:45:59,08 --> 00:46:04,83
But you knew about all the locomotives they were put up there. Did you were.

360
00:46:04,89 --> 00:46:10,65
Would you tell us about the day where they tested the bridge the day they put the roof.

361
00:46:10,71 --> 00:46:17,14
Well then that they put about seventy two locomotives up there.

362
00:46:19,97 --> 00:46:28,00
Somewhere about six they are seven hundred eighty town but they laid down there for about seven

363
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:37,15
or eight months before they took them out and that's inspired I know regards to testing.

364
00:46:37,92 --> 00:46:43,78
And I think that's about all I can tell you about the testing. Crowd. Thank you very much Mr Evans.
