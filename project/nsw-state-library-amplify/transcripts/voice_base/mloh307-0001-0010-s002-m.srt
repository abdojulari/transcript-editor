1
00:00:18,19 --> 00:00:32,79
Identification. This is side two went on to say Sion ten. And if I did I carried that petition around in my.

2
00:00:32,81 --> 00:00:40,75
For about a couple of weeks and I really wasn't.

3
00:00:41,22 --> 00:00:49,4
I didn't have the courage to show it to Irene our secretary because I didn't understand what it was about.

4
00:00:50,78 --> 00:00:59,52
And I didn't want to get involved in more than having these musical evenings. Raising funds for.

5
00:00:59,54 --> 00:01:03,75
Then we had an executive meeting. And yes he had said to Ari on the phone.

6
00:01:04,28 --> 00:01:10,96
Now tell me what are you doing about that petition. And of course what petition.

7
00:01:12,17 --> 00:01:15,38
Well I gave a copy of the petition to fight.

8
00:01:15,4 --> 00:01:22,57
Where Irene got onto the phone and said You bring that bloody petition in with you do you think they can you.

9
00:01:23,96 --> 00:01:24,86
What could I do.

10
00:01:26,09 --> 00:01:35,81
So I took the petition and I gave it to Irene and she immediately hit the ceiling in her excitement for all she said.

11
00:01:36,91 --> 00:01:45,64
So it's put on the agenda. And someone says Let's have a meeting to launch it.

12
00:01:46,7 --> 00:01:54,52
Yes good idea where we all chirp up you know and she said. Well.

13
00:01:55,26 --> 00:01:59,47
I became very enthusiastic now when I saw the enthusiasm of the others

14
00:01:59,47 --> 00:02:02,47
but not fully understanding what it was all about.

15
00:02:02,81 --> 00:02:07,14
I said we're going to have a meeting which should have been in the town hall nothing but the based

16
00:02:07,95 --> 00:02:15,46
and I can tell you this you know it was like my mother who would buy nothing unless it was the very best like.

17
00:02:16,1 --> 00:02:24,83
If you bought a pair of shoes they had to be the finest he'd. Even if he was dragging the soles of the old one.

18
00:02:26,23 --> 00:02:32,95
She bought class for. It had to be the strongest and it somehow rubbed off onto me.

19
00:02:33,14 --> 00:02:38,09
And if I go doesn't matter what I buy even when I had no money.

20
00:02:38,22 --> 00:02:45,05
I wouldn't buy until I got something that had some quality. So.

21
00:02:46,15 --> 00:02:55,54
So I say the Town Hall of course good idea since Bert and the enthusiasm was absolutely overwhelming.

22
00:02:55,55 --> 00:02:57,53
And then Erin said all right.

23
00:02:57,8 --> 00:03:05,06
I could arrange once and work it and see the lord mayor talk about it and see if we can't get her to rent free.

24
00:03:05,08 --> 00:03:11,92
Well it was seventy pounds I think for the rain but an eye for the town.

25
00:03:14,75 --> 00:03:26,88
And we'd use most of our money up to date for printing and the like later that counted.

26
00:03:26,9 --> 00:03:38,22
So are in town hall secretary might know point and for us all. But the Lord Mayor who was alderman Jensen and.

27
00:03:38,24 --> 00:03:47,51
The delegation which was led by Albert Thompson secretary of the milk when union

28
00:03:47,52 --> 00:03:54,07
and Albert was also on an executive at the suggestion of Perle who had known him for many years.

29
00:03:54,3 --> 00:04:00,34
So he said he'd leave the delegation and introduce us to the mayor. And this was quite acceptable.

30
00:04:00,79 --> 00:04:13,09
And in the delegation who was Myself and Irene and and Albert. And we have a cup of tea with them here.

31
00:04:13,11 --> 00:04:23,76
And said Can I have. I had only ever seen the town hall filled for the concert. Just to have a look inside. He said.

32
00:04:23,76 --> 00:04:33,32
Or you wouldn't be wanting them and I thought of for you. For you. Takes a few hundred. And I was almost offended.

33
00:04:33,34 --> 00:04:36,02
We will feel it.

34
00:04:37,14 --> 00:04:47,14
And he looked at me I had asked and looked Burkhead his reservations I could see that I have two thousand

35
00:04:47,14 --> 00:05:03,48
and two thousand five hundred. So the mayor said before use. And asked if he would share it and he said Well.

36
00:05:06,68 --> 00:05:19,65
Things got so we went back. And we started to. There was a very outstanding Australian artist who was also a printer.

37
00:05:20,4 --> 00:05:28,68
And we went to Rob Rob we needed some handbills and we need some posters to advertise the town hall meeting

38
00:05:30,25 --> 00:05:38,3
and you know road never charged and his work had won many prizes it was beautiful and he did big posters for us

39
00:05:40,56 --> 00:05:45,8
and we litter box like crazy and work up a hand in that some of the unions came

40
00:05:45,8 --> 00:05:55,22
and plastered the city telephone poles with. Posters beautiful red and black posters just beautiful.

41
00:05:58,83 --> 00:06:05,86
And our public relations scintillator to the editor of The Sydney Morning Herald who was printing.

42
00:06:07,47 --> 00:06:15,94
That he sent someone along to cover the meeting. It's.

43
00:06:16,1 --> 00:06:18,71
Something happened and I can't remember what it was

44
00:06:19,54 --> 00:06:26,72
but we were publicly accused of being raids that the rents were being given access to the town

45
00:06:26,72 --> 00:06:31,14
when all of the holes were bare and it was something like that.

46
00:06:32,7 --> 00:06:38,12
So there was a telephone call from the mayor secretary to Irene.

47
00:06:39,47 --> 00:06:47,51
Look of very sorry that may well not be able to change your. Meeting because he'll be out of town.

48
00:06:47,91 --> 00:06:53,51
And I rinsed fast and quick reply. The bastard. He's gone.

49
00:06:53,56 --> 00:07:02,29
Oh they tell me to a nice like says he he's got cold bloody face has same. She was one who call a spade a spade.

50
00:07:02,31 --> 00:07:05,45
That we were pleased and she was too because it made.

51
00:07:06,13 --> 00:07:12,55
That we could put the Aboriginal leader Doug nickels in the charity and shared.

52
00:07:12,57 --> 00:07:20,69
That very we had arranged with the member for the Sydney to launch the petition.

53
00:07:22,18 --> 00:07:31,65
Well he was going to be out of town also. People were getting cold feet. So not to be beaten.

54
00:07:32,75 --> 00:07:42,1
I said Halan the Member for Parkes a man of great courage and also a very cultured person right.

55
00:07:43,43 --> 00:07:50,54
And a great supporter of the Australian writers and many of the organizations that had been branded by the way

56
00:07:50,54 --> 00:07:58,89
and he was the Labor Member for power X. So I said to launch a petition he said Darling I would love to.

57
00:08:00,16 --> 00:08:04,23
And days he lost that petition with aplomb.

58
00:08:05,26 --> 00:08:12,7
If up so we were home at home and they were it was full speed of a head because I can tell you this.

59
00:08:16,1 --> 00:08:25,9
I hated the thought of the mail letter saying I told you you couldn't fill it. And we packed that.

60
00:08:25,92 --> 00:08:30,83
We bloody packed that. And I went up to die.

61
00:08:30,85 --> 00:08:38,12
Mary and I was very Will you come and speak and she said My dear child of course I will.

62
00:08:38,51 --> 00:08:41,68
And so she was in her ninety's.

63
00:08:41,69 --> 00:08:46,54
They brought her there and I think her relations brought if I remember correctly

64
00:08:47,3 --> 00:08:53,73
and the attendants got her in the lift to get her onto the platform. And Jessie carrying a man.

65
00:08:53,76 --> 00:09:04,62
Oh it was wonderful and all a large group of people that I hired about. And if it was wonderful and they were.

66
00:09:04,64 --> 00:09:15,46
They couldn't believe that I had the signator on hold for a meeting. So the others among the other speakers.

67
00:09:16,27 --> 00:09:23,19
The great British villainous from Melbourne.

68
00:09:24,9 --> 00:09:32,54
And we brought Harold Blair over you see we use some of the money in the kitty to bring him over from moment to speak

69
00:09:32,54 --> 00:09:45,07
and to sing. So I went out to the airport and I met Harold. And I took him to a friend of mine who lived. A couple.

70
00:09:45,94 --> 00:09:57,07
And I wouldn't picture was Hutchinson I took her over to the friend's place and had a rehearsal with. Harold.

71
00:09:57,09 --> 00:10:03,83
And then she accompanied him on the night interest wonderful to see Joyce on the.

72
00:10:04,34 --> 00:10:12,78
On the platform with Harold and so Harold really lifted that accordions out of their skins.

73
00:10:12,8 --> 00:10:19,06
I didn't approve with all of what he said I read. At that time a very different man.

74
00:10:19,82 --> 00:10:23,24
You know praise the Lord that the Salvation Army had saved him.

75
00:10:23,25 --> 00:10:33,09
And so I would have because he probably would have been one of the Stolen Children.

76
00:10:34,91 --> 00:10:41,77
But that was to beginning a very beautiful friendship with Harold and.

77
00:10:41,79 --> 00:10:55,46
In the following years for many years we would meet. At the annual conference in Canberra. And it was wonderful.

78
00:10:56,47 --> 00:11:01,7
I would just let him talk about whose years at the Juilliard School of Music.

79
00:11:02,41 --> 00:11:19,23
How he better to continue with his training and all the discrimination he missed. Also.

80
00:11:20,92 --> 00:11:23,8
We have that was the beginning of my friendship with Harold

81
00:11:27,04 --> 00:11:37,52
and I think you enjoyed talking to me because nobody else wanted to hear about his years of training. And so anyhow.

82
00:11:37,54 --> 00:11:49,97
So the meeting was very successful but when some of the people got cold feet. I went to. Father.

83
00:11:50,09 --> 00:11:58,13
Clint the founder of the tramp ecology. And I said Listen now he's got cold feet.

84
00:11:59,59 --> 00:12:06,86
And they're not going to participate and the meeting is being branded a Communist meeting.

85
00:12:08,14 --> 00:12:15,91
And I'm worried that we won't get. Not only the coverage we certainly didn't get that but I'm aware.

86
00:12:16,1 --> 00:12:22,28
That we will get the money to pay the rent for that all else and leave.

87
00:12:22,29 --> 00:12:33,34
So rounded up some of his good clergy fellows and was a bloke by the name of Bill chiles from the mining area.

88
00:12:33,43 --> 00:12:40,4
Michael and I think it was known the minus great. So he came down for the meeting.

89
00:12:40,7 --> 00:12:45,72
And in the was a person from the Anglican Church by the name of father.

90
00:12:45,96 --> 00:12:57,27
Frank counterattack who later became Bishop of prison. And he came among They were men Christian men with courage.

91
00:12:59,25 --> 00:13:04,89
And what he did that he put the meeting started and it went with a bang

92
00:13:05,97 --> 00:13:11,56
and then came the time to raise the money to pay for the rent take up a collection and Bill.

93
00:13:11,61 --> 00:13:13,93
Charles got on one end of the platform.

94
00:13:14,25 --> 00:13:19,94
And Frank outright got on the other end of the platform and they had a competition to see who could raise the most.

95
00:13:21,06 --> 00:13:30,59
And we collected over four hundred which was. Absolutely tremendous amount of money.

96
00:13:31,55 --> 00:13:43,01
So we paid the rent and we got on with propaganda. Well the fellowship flourished circulated that petition.

97
00:13:44,22 --> 00:13:50,21
We got the unions to take it but the churches were very hesitant very excited about it

98
00:13:50,96 --> 00:13:55,72
and as for the political parties Well I wouldn't touch it with a twenty foot rock and.

99
00:13:56,83 --> 00:13:57,41
Indeed

100
00:13:57,42 --> 00:14:07,76
when Jack Horner was lighter elected as secretary he was called in by John Kerry who belong to the hierarchy of the

101
00:14:07,76 --> 00:14:14,12
liberal Liberal Party whose headquarters were in Rose Street in the city and this man rang.

102
00:14:14,33 --> 00:14:16,03
Jack up and asked if he were.

103
00:14:16,1 --> 00:14:22,52
In the office to talk to him and on the why into the fellowship office called in

104
00:14:22,52 --> 00:14:25,03
and Carrick had the cheek to say to him.

105
00:14:25,04 --> 00:14:32,5
Give me the names of the communists who are in the Aboriginal Australia and fellowship. Yeah.

106
00:14:33,58 --> 00:14:43,99
Jack has never forgotten that and. Well there were people day and I remember a woman.

107
00:14:44,7 --> 00:14:56,68
Joe and it was far shillings to do. And when we were branded she asked if she could have made me. Back.

108
00:14:57,49 --> 00:15:07,25
So you know it was a terrible time but the more we were persecuted the more courageous we truly did

109
00:15:07,95 --> 00:15:17,68
and it was the backing of those people that kept us go in. And then I went to great people important people Joey.

110
00:15:19,53 --> 00:15:32,06
Q Second you couldn't hold back. Henry and. Joe. And I were very generous financially to the fellowship.

111
00:15:33,56 --> 00:15:40,42
There were people who had it likely who had escaped the German.

112
00:15:41,78 --> 00:15:46,72
The great need to help the rich people with their rights and there was nothing else going

113
00:15:46,72 --> 00:15:48,28
but the fellowship at that time.

114
00:15:48,61 --> 00:15:55,84
Who was dealing with the political issues that the average Chinese were confronted with being deprived of all its

115
00:15:55,84 --> 00:16:07,61
rights and mentioned. And we carried on always very regularly meeting monthly.

116
00:16:07,63 --> 00:16:20,34
Second or whatever it was and it grew in strength and it grew in power. And. The following year after its formation.

117
00:16:20,36 --> 00:16:27,93
Jesse once again came up with the idea of forming the federal body. And she had to be an opponent for quite some time.

118
00:16:28,53 --> 00:16:32,69
Well the petition was being circulated very well by the fellowship.

119
00:16:33,09 --> 00:16:41,37
But there was a need for a federal body because it had to do with the federal Constitution.

120
00:16:42,44 --> 00:16:53,08
So another person who felt this Jesse did was a person by the name of Dr Charles do good from South Australia who'd

121
00:16:53,08 --> 00:16:57,06
given tremendous amount of time and energy to do good

122
00:16:57,07 --> 00:17:02,25
and practical thing is lifting they have pretty nice out of their misery.

123
00:17:02,94 --> 00:17:10,56
He was a very highly skilled surgeon and I had a lot of time with him beautiful friendship I had with him.

124
00:17:11,42 --> 00:17:15,08
And he wrote to J.C. and Said look you've got to have whole body.

125
00:17:15,45 --> 00:17:21,19
And we'll get the bill into the federal parliament and abolish all the state laws

126
00:17:22,1 --> 00:17:29,36
and let the people function like all other human beings in the country and yes he took less. And she wouldn't drop out.

127
00:17:30,48 --> 00:17:32,79
So she wrote to my friend

128
00:17:32,79 --> 00:17:42,94
and her friend Shirley in the federal lived in Melbourne a scientist suggesting that felt robotic should take should

129
00:17:42,95 --> 00:17:55,11
pay for. And she and I had many a chat about this. In fifty seven. I think it was in. The federal form.

130
00:17:55,59 --> 00:17:58,33
In Adelaide they had a meeting in Adelaide

131
00:17:58,33 --> 00:18:04,62
and that was the first meeting of what became known as the Federal Council for the advancement of every journalist

132
00:18:05,88 --> 00:18:16,02
and that perceived. And we had another musical evening at Sibyl's place at Gordon. And we raised the.

133
00:18:16,1 --> 00:18:25,02
After money to send our secretary he was no longer the secretary. We had a secretary. MARION.

134
00:18:27,62 --> 00:18:31,64
All the dice and was still a president.

135
00:18:31,68 --> 00:18:40,21
So we raised enough money to send them over to have lied to represent a fellowship at which the Federal Council for the

136
00:18:40,21 --> 00:18:53,2
Advancement of a pretty loose. And the we're not overly many Aboriginal people. But there was.

137
00:18:53,22 --> 00:19:02,9
And I think villainous was. A couple from South Australia. And the two.

138
00:19:04,85 --> 00:19:11,37
And I have a feeling that was it the my have been more but I'm not quite sure. But Don Dunstan was there.

139
00:19:13,36 --> 00:19:24,83
Yes Don was there and. It was not the Parliament hereon Oh yes a person from Western Australia.

140
00:19:25,11 --> 00:19:29,24
By the name of Graydon he was a member of the Liberal Party.

141
00:19:29,26 --> 00:19:42,36
But he had contact with Nicholas and he had gone into the open. With a group of other people. To visit.

142
00:19:43,76 --> 00:19:55,28
A community that was said to hunger and he'd made a documentary have this show. Which we used extensively incidentally.

143
00:19:55,86 --> 00:20:03,67
To publish the plight of the brutal people by the Fellowship and the Federal Council.

144
00:20:03,69 --> 00:20:15,07
And I think the grain went to that first conference. Was Turnt remember I did mention her nothing.

145
00:20:16,1 --> 00:20:25,57
Anything is that you went to London. I think soon after that. But anyhow. The Federal Council and.

146
00:20:26,36 --> 00:20:31,31
And it had its second meeting in Melbourne and I think the third was here in Sydney

147
00:20:31,31 --> 00:20:35,89
but I wouldn't say for sure whether it was the the second just now

148
00:20:37,06 --> 00:20:48,38
and I had to get with the secretary of the Fellowship had poked the workers educational center.

149
00:20:48,39 --> 00:20:56,3
Which was an Grambling house with big verandas invades all around the veranda a big community kitchen

150
00:20:56,3 --> 00:21:07,29
and so forth for the conference. And the conference was held. I think it was over an Easter.

151
00:21:08,2 --> 00:21:28,97
And I recall going down to the office to pick up a. Dance to. To drive him to the conference.

152
00:21:28,99 --> 00:21:39,37
And for the child's do good. Yes he had vanished. She was probably in line and again.

153
00:21:41,31 --> 00:21:48,31
At the conference got off the ground and. At that time trials do good precedent.

154
00:21:50,18 --> 00:21:58,02
And it was very important people coming including off with Lamar Mark mentioned.

155
00:21:58,04 --> 00:22:03,83
And he I don't think he was leader of the Labor Party but getting very close to it if you ask me.

156
00:22:03,86 --> 00:22:19,62
Can I just ask you this conference was. It could have been sixty. I've got in my records.

157
00:22:21,03 --> 00:22:25,83
Well they are quite a number of Aboriginal people who had come.

158
00:22:26,11 --> 00:22:37,14
Not so many interstate except for the Melbourne people in the Brisbane people but the local people. And they came from.

159
00:22:38,64 --> 00:22:50,8
What was known as the wooden bar. Aboriginal reserve. A man by the name of. His roots were very deep in the land.

160
00:22:51,22 --> 00:23:02,77
And it was a member of the Holy Rollers of some kind of how quite sure but he was no fool and he came down.

161
00:23:02,78 --> 00:23:09,31
And without invitation or he thinks someone who speaks. And I took the floor.

162
00:23:09,67 --> 00:23:17,25
And he stood at the front with a dictionary in one hand and the bottle in the other hand and he said we want to L.A.

163
00:23:17,25 --> 00:23:28,44
and. We want a million dollars for our land. I mean it's a big man of course and.

164
00:23:30,24 --> 00:23:37,31
His request was made it was mingled with praising the Lord and that the Lord would say that we'd get the land

165
00:23:37,31 --> 00:23:46,11
but it needed the council to work in the background and give it a push easy and I think you would use talking. Anyhow.

166
00:23:47,35 --> 00:23:57,1
Then it came in the matter of the petition. And someone moved a motion that the petition should be taken over.

167
00:23:57,12 --> 00:24:02,7
The Federal Council and it should be circulated on a national level.

168
00:24:02,71 --> 00:24:10,68
And one of the speakers in that discussion happened to be a bloke name of. His student his feet and said we'd never do.

169
00:24:10,84 --> 00:24:15,89
We'd never change the federal Constitution. Never. And it. We could.

170
00:24:16,1 --> 00:24:26,62
But it may not be to the benefit of the Aboriginal people and took this giant to go off.

171
00:24:27,4 --> 00:24:38,24
And an argument developed between. And little lane and Vic and Len said we can do it. There's nothing to stop us.

172
00:24:38,49 --> 00:24:41,09
We'll go out and collect the signatures we can do it.

173
00:24:42,5 --> 00:24:51,2
Anyhow the motion was put and it was carried off likes to remember that.

174
00:24:55,71 --> 00:25:00,63
So the pitch Titian or circulated for the referendum and that was the beginning.

175
00:25:01,28 --> 00:25:11,42
Of one of the most vigorous campaigns I would say that it ever in carried out in Australia that campaign against the

176
00:25:13,23 --> 00:25:20,02
proposal to ban the Communist Party was a terrific campaign. Nobody could ever dispute that.

177
00:25:20,31 --> 00:25:31,38
And I'm sure the campaign against conscription during Maurice's. Was vigorous.

178
00:25:31,78 --> 00:25:36,29
Because it would have embraced a lot of middle class people who didn't want to lose this.

179
00:25:36,92 --> 00:25:37,73
And had the time

180
00:25:37,73 --> 00:25:47,82
and the energy to towards opposing the proposals that our referendum campaign worst horrific truly Qualls

181
00:25:50,51 --> 00:26:06,38
and I thought I'd like to say here. How easy it is to be obsessed with. And observation sometimes is a bad thing.

182
00:26:07,79 --> 00:26:19,66
In this case it was that it had completely taken over my life. The other person was. Kathe Walker who reverted to.

183
00:26:19,68 --> 00:26:28,67
Traditional name. And have worked around the clock for the success of the referendum.

184
00:26:29,11 --> 00:26:37,83
Made after me after meeting and I worked around the clock meeting after meeting after meeting.

185
00:26:38,49 --> 00:26:49,76
I would put the children on the bass for school. Peter works with us in. And. Run through the house.

186
00:26:50,17 --> 00:26:59,12
I've accumulated house every day engine that has at French's forest this one is luckily lucky if it gets this spitting

187
00:26:59,12 --> 00:27:01,43
skittle once a week.

188
00:27:01,44 --> 00:27:11,86
And I would leave the dinner ready things like that ten o'clock in the car off to do at least three meetings.

189
00:27:12,77 --> 00:27:15,91
And I would comprise like the law and class.

190
00:27:16,4 --> 00:27:27,79
The I picks class rotary The View clubs the churches rather than the churches had come in the church meetings the

191
00:27:27,79 --> 00:27:36,31
unions who are now after all. Now that you know. I just went on. And this was happening in every state.

192
00:27:36,33 --> 00:27:42,7
And that wasn't happening at every stage. Really. But by then we had television.

193
00:27:42,71 --> 00:27:50,82
And I was among one of the first persons to be interviewed on television that had to do with Aboriginal rights

194
00:27:50,82 --> 00:27:57,67
and that was Channel seven. Because I knew one of the presenters and that was the tried.

195
00:27:57,98 --> 00:28:06,61
And many times interview me many times and so it became a national issue through television

196
00:28:06,61 --> 00:28:11,89
and we were fortunate to have the right. It happened at the right time.

197
00:28:11,93 --> 00:28:15,00
But the other states didn't have a person like me.

198
00:28:16,72 --> 00:28:26,1
Who was who were particularly articulate and who were free to do it and had the resources to do it.

199
00:28:26,63 --> 00:28:34,18
And the Federal Council was kept around Australia but there was only enough money to do that for one person

200
00:28:34,18 --> 00:28:42,44
and since she had it down to a fine after was a good go drop. It was better that we put the money into just that one.

201
00:28:43,93 --> 00:28:53,38
Well. I would get to make sure before three o'clock in the afternoon. Although we had a.

202
00:28:53,39 --> 00:29:01,38
It really wasn't good enough for me I just had to be in the US went along with the children. Peter got in.

203
00:29:04,86 --> 00:29:15,12
And then I'd spent that time between the children coming. Which would be about six o'clock. They'd have only.

204
00:29:16,86 --> 00:29:24,97
Just with them. And then hands would come home and read the stories.

205
00:29:26,59 --> 00:29:36,3
And sometimes they have to get in at night for a meeting. Like we had enlisted the help of municipal councils.

206
00:29:36,41 --> 00:29:50,92
So there was need to go to a meeting. By invitation. And organizations like.

207
00:29:52,81 --> 00:30:03,84
Multinational organizations that had been established and people from Europe. And many who had escaped.

208
00:30:03,85 --> 00:30:05,39
Were very interested to see

209
00:30:05,39 --> 00:30:13,38
and hear what was happening to the Indigenous Australians It was amazing the amount of interest that was taken by

210
00:30:13,38 --> 00:30:14,86
people who had come from Europe.

211
00:30:16,1 --> 00:30:26,23
And they were fearful that what had happened to many of their relations and friends could happen here.

212
00:30:27,89 --> 00:30:38,32
Because this witch hunt. Was when the stable millions of dollars was being poured into.

213
00:30:38,34 --> 00:30:54,05
These creeps of security who spied on us. Who cheated us who followed us around. And. Looking for victims.

214
00:30:55,86 --> 00:31:04,9
So Australia was confronted with some serious issues at that time that had to do with the freedom of the people.

215
00:31:06,27 --> 00:31:17,05
I think I should say here. I was I had so many requests to speak. And interestingly enough.

216
00:31:17,31 --> 00:31:28,73
Carol and I have to go on and say that they are just pouring in. Today. Ninety seven and I can't.

217
00:31:31,21 --> 00:31:35,06
Age his coat up with me then I took it in my strap.
