1
00:00:03,42 --> 00:00:04,05
I'm speaking to mr.

2
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:10,94
George happened and who worked on the
sydney harbour bridge as an ironworker and

3
00:00:10,94 --> 00:00:15,83
i'm going to ask him what job he actually
did do you member those times. Mr everton

4
00:00:16,69 --> 00:00:21,00
my job was in the roof and squad and i
reverence got consist of the three men

5
00:00:22,12 --> 00:00:28,90
sometimes for there was the man
that took the river. A man that

6
00:00:29,80 --> 00:00:35,33
my position was the older up for the
boilermaker i used it except the rivets and

7
00:00:35,33 --> 00:00:40,27
the ready for me and i used to put them in
and the river to the other side round of

8
00:00:40,27 --> 00:00:46,29
them off. And so forth. In the end which
case that we needed was meant to pass the

9
00:00:46,29 --> 00:00:50,56
river for you to get an awkward look at
positions and we had over mount up after it

10
00:00:50,56 --> 00:00:54,33
was to the other times we had
to put them down a sort of

11
00:00:54,33 --> 00:00:56,12
a chute and they come in to

12
00:00:57,80 --> 00:01:01,65
a kerosene tin the end of the chute and i
think you know take them from there with

13
00:01:01,65 --> 00:01:06,33
teratomas of course and put them into
the hole and they're not all my rattler

14
00:01:06,33 --> 00:01:11,31
dollar on them while the revit on the other
side is to round them over and complete

15
00:01:11,31 --> 00:01:17,70
the job but if those rivets
weren't the complete. Heat heated

16
00:01:18,72 --> 00:01:20,94
. They don't be taken out
because they'd sweat

17
00:01:20,94 --> 00:01:27,42
a bit. And once they sweated they come
loose in the hole and the time inspectors

18
00:01:27,42 --> 00:01:31,84
used to come around and inspect the job.
After they killed our bet and if they were

19
00:01:31,84 --> 00:01:38,21
loose at all. It'll be taken out straight
away and other times i summarise i used

20
00:01:38,21 --> 00:01:43,57
to cook rivets for the on the job. But
mostly my job was holding up for the

21
00:01:43,57 --> 00:01:46,90
boilermaker. And there's

22
00:01:46,91 --> 00:01:53,10
a very different job we work inside
accords. And we used to straddle court like

23
00:01:53,10 --> 00:01:57,35
they're all the rivet heads and they
have to try and hold ourselves in

24
00:01:57,35 --> 00:02:03,67
a position to to complete the job. The
whole of the river firmly volleyball i

25
00:02:03,67 --> 00:02:10,59
cannot be on the other
side and one occasion when

26
00:02:10,60 --> 00:02:15,54
the first thing i went up for the the
roadway. The squad that i was working with

27
00:02:16,29 --> 00:02:21,51
where a put on the job. And
there was one river. Well as

28
00:02:21,51 --> 00:02:25,45
a few rivers that i couldn't reach off
the stage in the cells. I threw them on

29
00:02:25,45 --> 00:02:31,08
a box to reach and when i put my shoe.
You know overhead and turn the air on it

30
00:02:31,08 --> 00:02:37,16
threw me back over the stage and. And i
fell and as i fell. I grabbed the stage and

31
00:02:38,05 --> 00:02:43,82
and i held on like grim death of my two
mites the cooker and the cooker rivets and

32
00:02:43,82 --> 00:02:48,58
the ball and i grabbed me. I think they got
big it's more the shock that i did. But

33
00:02:48,58 --> 00:02:53,22
it happened on a friday afternoon and
which came with a weekend to have

34
00:02:53,22 --> 00:02:56,08
a count of course and naturally we knocked
off straightaway the ball and i got

35
00:02:56,08 --> 00:03:02,58
myself and i cook and we were all
upset and you wish went home and

36
00:03:06,28 --> 00:03:11,55
do you remember how long you were working
on on the bridge. Yes i was on the edge

37
00:03:11,56 --> 00:03:16,96
for fourteen months and after the archery
completed. I think floyd by the new to

38
00:03:16,96 --> 00:03:22,87
tell it like me on the roadway. And i think
it was only on there for about seven

39
00:03:22,88 --> 00:03:26,47
right weeks before the roadway is completed
and. The bridge is ready for the

40
00:03:26,47 --> 00:03:31,80
opening. Do you member the conditions inside
the chords on the arch hood idea they

41
00:03:31,80 --> 00:03:38,30
were very definite and no frankly no light
at all and that i just tell you before.

42
00:03:38,31 --> 00:03:44,73
Like i used to stand head to the rivets.
To try and get down to the hole rivets in

43
00:03:44,73 --> 00:03:49,77
theme for these and. And.
Sort of somewhat a bit of

44
00:03:49,77 --> 00:03:55,58
a stage in but mostly where to
find our own foot in sort of thing

45
00:03:56,68 --> 00:04:02,11
to get hot. What to wear leather gloves
there were stop the sparks and flying off

46
00:04:02,11 --> 00:04:06,21
the rivets on the scale that come off the
rivers like after you put them in their

47
00:04:06,22 --> 00:04:12,92
doors when you turn the nomadic
riveter on the machine on the sparks

48
00:04:12,92 --> 00:04:17,21
fly and erupt and burn something neck and
arms and that sort of thing where to wear

49
00:04:17,21 --> 00:04:23,43
these leather gloves. And what was there
were when it's hot in the afternoon and

50
00:04:23,43 --> 00:04:30,05
cold in the morning or well inside the
craws very hot. You know. On windy days

51
00:04:30,05 --> 00:04:35,40
because we couldn't stay up there like
they hang on like grim death and and very

52
00:04:35,40 --> 00:04:42,38
windy up there and. It is only natural
and right like that it was very hot

53
00:04:42,38 --> 00:04:47,78
inside but with the working conditions
like compared to other jobs. Well i was

54
00:04:47,78 --> 00:04:53,30
quite happy cause those about old times
and gotten. Much work around of the time

55
00:04:54,26 --> 00:05:01,05
but. I was quite happy. Do you remember
that what you do lunch time did you go

56
00:05:01,05 --> 00:05:07,82
down. Oh yes we went down off the
bridge and here lunch and. Mostly we

57
00:05:07,83 --> 00:05:12,21
used to come up on the cage of the punt
used to take the men up onto the bridge or

58
00:05:12,21 --> 00:05:18,55
some of these to go up the cords ourselves
that. Mattie were to advocate and in the

59
00:05:18,55 --> 00:05:24,35
box in the box. Do you remember.

60
00:05:25,61 --> 00:05:29,82
As far as the. What did you have any
toilet facilities up on the arch.

61
00:05:29,82 --> 00:05:36,57
. No not really no no we have come
down more or less to use the toilets

62
00:05:37,70 --> 00:05:39,47
but because we had

63
00:05:39,47 --> 00:05:46,45
a make shift sort of thing
but mostly they come down.

64
00:05:46,46 --> 00:05:50,57
Tell me about the time when you worked on
the ash well to after you finished on the

65
00:05:50,57 --> 00:05:52,61
on the arch. Well i think that was

66
00:05:52,61 --> 00:05:56,24
a harder work than what i
was on the bridge. Out of

67
00:05:56,24 --> 00:06:02,29
a load the new show till we used to have
these fifty six pound rams who to ram the

68
00:06:03,29 --> 00:06:09,22
field into the into the metal grooves like
on the arch there for the roadway care

69
00:06:09,22 --> 00:06:13,50
in the roadway and covered
in blisters and hands

70
00:06:13,51 --> 00:06:18,80
a very sore after that was very
hard work. How many were you in

71
00:06:18,80 --> 00:06:25,10
a gang of asphalt as well about four or
five of you to line up behind each other

72
00:06:25,10 --> 00:06:29,90
and we'd like just follow one another through
with these. With these machines with

73
00:06:29,90 --> 00:06:36,86
these rams and you know about
four or five as you say and it

74
00:06:36,86 --> 00:06:42,38
was all hand. Do you remember any accidents
do you what are you working on the

75
00:06:42,38 --> 00:06:48,04
bridge. Oh years so i was working just
close to a man came out and he was

76
00:06:48,04 --> 00:06:53,10
a he was a boilermaker and he have

77
00:06:53,10 --> 00:06:59,09
a balance and fell from the bridge and
who we were came down with to get on his

78
00:06:59,09 --> 00:07:02,90
body like when he fell from the bridge we
came down of the punt there and neither

79
00:07:02,90 --> 00:07:04,94
one of four men that died in

80
00:07:04,94 --> 00:07:10,26
a try and rescue him. We knew his body
was there but we just had a you know

81
00:07:10,26 --> 00:07:15,34
a very american. If we could have got him
but we didn't we all went home then. And

82
00:07:15,34 --> 00:07:21,76
. Over it got his body about three hours
ten minutes after that the water hit the

83
00:07:21,76 --> 00:07:28,64
water about ten o'clock and driver has
got his body at it. 1:10. Also remember

84
00:07:28,64 --> 00:07:35,29
another man named kelly who fell he was
rather fortunate he came down feet first.

85
00:07:35,46 --> 00:07:36,65
He was he was

86
00:07:36,65 --> 00:07:40,39
a diver and i dived in squatted below mine
and the swimmers got there and they had

87
00:07:40,39 --> 00:07:45,09
the right to take it right. Himself and
came down feet first which he was very

88
00:07:45,09 --> 00:07:47,14
lucky he had to get a result of

89
00:07:47,14 --> 00:07:52,29
a couple of broken ribs i think if i can
remember rightly. Remember any others

90
00:07:52,29 --> 00:07:58,96
accidents and people who didn't die. Not
really. I can remember one occasion where

91
00:07:58,97 --> 00:08:04,46
i was chappy sitting on the wharf there
doing these feet in the water there and

92
00:08:04,46 --> 00:08:06,79
from a high fly that we could
see deep down in the water like

93
00:08:06,79 --> 00:08:11,29
a through the shark cruising around near
the water and i was trying to get just man

94
00:08:11,29 --> 00:08:16,97
so i do given the office that they check
of around there. And they thought either

95
00:08:16,97 --> 00:08:21,56
way want or any way back but i think even
chile got out the water but i don't know

96
00:08:21,56 --> 00:08:25,59
what they saw the shark or not but the
shackle truth and what we knew what he was.

97
00:08:25,60 --> 00:08:30,25
By and his feet were there any other incidents
like that where were you see things

98
00:08:30,25 --> 00:08:35,10
from up the top that you can remember.
Well yes we saw porters there one day

99
00:08:36,27 --> 00:08:38,75
because we could see them from the
ground. We used to see them from

100
00:08:38,75 --> 00:08:44,28
a height up to my own forces not only girls
and they go through lee that. You see

101
00:08:44,28 --> 00:08:50,59
the boats very birds going from
underneath and that's about all i think

102
00:08:51,51 --> 00:08:57,34
. How did you get to work. Where did you
live then. Well live the punchbowl here to

103
00:08:57,34 --> 00:09:04,15
come down by train to the key is like the
row at least and the underground wasn't

104
00:09:04,15 --> 00:09:09,58
there then and to go across the
ferry boat to the punt and

105
00:09:11,81 --> 00:09:18,59
get on the part and govern the in the
box and the punt. Do you remember what

106
00:09:18,59 --> 00:09:25,37
used to do in your lunch oh well i think
most of you play your field in the time

107
00:09:25,38 --> 00:09:25,75
you know on

108
00:09:25,75 --> 00:09:30,64
a rainy day we used to like knock off
work and we can set them play kashrut why

109
00:09:30,64 --> 00:09:35,52
throw the weather cleared if the weather
didn't play well we went home to get paid

110
00:09:35,52 --> 00:09:41,17
any time when it was running well i can't
remember now i want to go thirty years

111
00:09:41,17 --> 00:09:43,40
a long while i can't remember
whether we were paid for

112
00:09:43,40 --> 00:09:47,51
a lost time or not. Several people had
said that you've got one hour's waiting in

113
00:09:47,51 --> 00:09:50,46
the company's time and one hour waiting in
your time and then after that you got so

114
00:09:50,46 --> 00:09:52,04
noon. It could be right to

115
00:09:52,04 --> 00:09:56,92
a long while now. I don't really remember
but i wouldn't swear to that but they

116
00:09:56,92 --> 00:10:03,06
could be right. Did you get hurt at all.
Well the well the bridge was going on now

117
00:10:03,07 --> 00:10:04,97
. I didn't get hurt but by

118
00:10:04,97 --> 00:10:11,20
a father was worked on the beast to air
attacks and he was in the miter court in

119
00:10:11,20 --> 00:10:12,74
a hospital over north sydney for it for

120
00:10:12,74 --> 00:10:19,41
a while he heard he said on
the. On the girder there

121
00:10:19,41 --> 00:10:20,56
and he's in there for

122
00:10:20,56 --> 00:10:27,58
a few weeks he's not alive now
how did he hurt himself. Well

123
00:10:27,58 --> 00:10:32,02
he's getting down underneath the underneath
the good and he came out too quick and

124
00:10:32,02 --> 00:10:36,82
he said caught the top of the
girl and still is right over. And

125
00:10:39,93 --> 00:10:45,28
do you remember any union activity on the
bridge. No i don't think we had much

126
00:10:45,28 --> 00:10:52,26
trouble as far as unions of
concerned. Quite quite happy. You

127
00:10:52,26 --> 00:10:52,83
know i get in

128
00:10:52,83 --> 00:10:58,66
a unionist evie's i can't remember now.
Anyway has. What you know you in on the

129
00:10:58,66 --> 00:11:05,66
ironworkers union. And we had no travel
drama the name of the secretary or the

130
00:11:05,66 --> 00:11:12,22
delegates on the job. Cooksey
was i think me and i

131
00:11:12,22 --> 00:11:17,72
cooksey i think was our delegate there. I
can't. I don't know the secretary was at

132
00:11:17,72 --> 00:11:22,56
the time i don't know whether laurie short
or not i. I don't think it was and i

133
00:11:22,56 --> 00:11:27,03
mean i don't cooksey i think she was i
mean. But our delegate there. Yes i heard

134
00:11:27,03 --> 00:11:27,80
his name mentioned as

135
00:11:27,80 --> 00:11:31,96
a delegate before i believe the secretary
was colin tannock but i'm not quite sure

136
00:11:31,96 --> 00:11:38,26
. Content can. Colin tell it could be he
was there after i left the bridge and i

137
00:11:38,26 --> 00:11:43,48
looked about and cannoli was still the
secretary then. Do you remember any amusing

138
00:11:43,48 --> 00:11:48,13
instance that might have happened by while
you were on the bridge. Now i don't

139
00:11:48,13 --> 00:11:54,62
think you know him years and no sir i
don't countryman in the remember any

140
00:11:54,62 --> 00:11:55,18
skylarking

141
00:11:55,18 --> 00:12:01,51
a thing. No skylarking now we're all very
careful its allies were always in danger

142
00:12:01,51 --> 00:12:07,13
. We never took an interest skylarking these
things like that. Not on the arch low

143
00:12:07,92 --> 00:12:10,84
in the workshop they use a skylark
a bit. Well i never worked in

144
00:12:10,84 --> 00:12:17,55
a workshop i wouldn't know as i wouldn't.
How did you get when did you get laid off

145
00:12:18,50 --> 00:12:25,16
. Well i was almost the completion
of the bridge and therefore like our

146
00:12:25,16 --> 00:12:29,73
cells weren't required and i have

147
00:12:29,73 --> 00:12:36,71
a reference from the doorman longs. And
it's something about treasure and. And

148
00:12:37,75 --> 00:12:38,13
fifty years

149
00:12:38,13 --> 00:12:44,70
a long while and i can't think of anything
else that i can really tell you about

150
00:12:46,64 --> 00:12:53,14
here. Looking back at the time we worked
either bridge and the way it is now what

151
00:12:53,15 --> 00:12:56,92
do you think of the proposal
to add lanes to the reg.

152
00:12:56,92 --> 00:13:03,32
. Well i don't know as i think it might
spoil the look of the bridge of the harbour

153
00:13:03,33 --> 00:13:09,36
bridge. Is something that we're always
treasured i try to improve and anyway. I

154
00:13:09,36 --> 00:13:13,00
don't think they are done they can be
done. I think they could find some

155
00:13:13,00 --> 00:13:19,06
alternatives other than build the. The
other. Span. They're talking about. I don't

156
00:13:19,06 --> 00:13:25,89
think they would make the base look any
better. Do you remember any of the of the

157
00:13:25,89 --> 00:13:29,98
chiefs of doormen along with the public
works do you remember what their names were

158
00:13:29,98 --> 00:13:35,92
and who they were did you have any dealings
with them. Yes. And he was the year he

159
00:13:35,92 --> 00:13:40,72
was the head man and i believe the man
assigned my reference to by the way he was

160
00:13:40,72 --> 00:13:46,75
the. Engineers of so i like the chief
engineer and one of the chief in today's on

161
00:13:46,75 --> 00:13:51,52
the bridge. It's a man
and big tall man. He's

162
00:13:51,53 --> 00:13:57,31
a reference as mr. Alf
martin bevan that's mr.

00:13:57,31 --> 00:14:01,87
Alfred martin is it right itself
and martin yes. Remember mr.

164
00:14:01,87 --> 00:14:04,04
Ennis it and i think mr.

165
00:14:04,04 --> 00:14:05,13
Innes here. He's not

166
00:14:05,13 --> 00:14:11,09
a man that i can remember the
name remembering well fifty years

167
00:14:11,09 --> 00:14:17,78
a long island they're certainly
stretcher. Do you member ever seeing

168
00:14:17,78 --> 00:14:23,21
dr bradfield around do you talk to him. No
i never spoke to him but i had seen him

169
00:14:23,21 --> 00:14:28,61
on the job. There you know inspect and
different right. Like. On top there is

170
00:14:28,61 --> 00:14:33,35
walking around there and. Especially when
the bridge lot. He was on top there with

171
00:14:33,35 --> 00:14:35,52
a with a few other heads martin

172
00:14:35,52 --> 00:14:41,76
a few more that i never spoke to bradfield.
Do you remember. Were you working on

173
00:14:41,76 --> 00:14:46,34
the bridge when the arch was
locked. Yes all working on

174
00:14:46,34 --> 00:14:50,99
a bridge in the night slog. I worked only
as i tell you i worked on the road by

175
00:14:50,99 --> 00:14:55,21
after the bridge was locked. But i was on
the bridge on the bridge lot before the

176
00:14:55,21 --> 00:15:01,30
bridge locked the bridge itself
useless why sway you know vibration

177
00:15:02,08 --> 00:15:07,26
before it locked and that was i was told
over the good sign that and one of the

178
00:15:07,26 --> 00:15:13,62
lockable i'd like perfect. I worked on the
north side we were ever afraid when its

179
00:15:13,62 --> 00:15:17,73
weight around before out
was locked. No it was

180
00:15:17,73 --> 00:15:21,11
a bit nervous when i first
arrived on the basis. After

181
00:15:21,11 --> 00:15:26,21
a while you get your confidence and. Who
just like an ordinary straight walk from

182
00:15:26,21 --> 00:15:28,04
there on is to run around a bit like

183
00:15:28,04 --> 00:15:34,55
a little frog in that and and like
i don't think i was nervous now

184
00:15:36,14 --> 00:15:39,27
i think i was the youngest man working to
break the time and only just twenty one

185
00:15:39,27 --> 00:15:44,73
just turned twenty one and i don't think
anyone younger than me on the arch because

186
00:15:44,73 --> 00:15:48,71
a lot of men worked in the workshop but
on the ata so i don't think it was more

187
00:15:48,71 --> 00:15:48,89
than

188
00:15:48,89 --> 00:15:53,69
a hundred men or. Only art and talk about
the north sydney so i don't know what about

189
00:15:53,69 --> 00:15:57,88
the south side. Do you have of the names
of any of the riggers do you think the

190
00:15:57,88 --> 00:16:04,24
riggers were good to know.
Yes the riggers i remember

191
00:16:05,04 --> 00:16:10,04
jack williams he was one of the head regulars
there and after i left the bridge. I

192
00:16:10,04 --> 00:16:14,28
went to work for bread and candles and he
happened to be one of the bosses breath

193
00:16:14,28 --> 00:16:15,28
and cattle so we had

194
00:16:15,28 --> 00:16:19,84
a lot in common and he was my boss at the
back and kennel than this week still

195
00:16:19,84 --> 00:16:26,14
working but we rode. But near
here. And he's not alive now.

196
00:16:27,80 --> 00:16:31,80

197
00:16:31,80 --> 00:16:37,79

finish the bridge there are lots of for

198
00:16:37,79 --> 00:16:38,94

199
00:16:38,94 --> 00:16:44,35

bridge. I don't think i had much trouble

200
00:16:44,35 --> 00:16:44,72
getting

201
00:16:44,72 --> 00:16:50,76
a job there. He went on the dole it all.
Oh yes i was in the relief work for quite

202
00:16:50,76 --> 00:16:56,29
a while after you know after the. If
anything out of breath and get all finished

203
00:16:57,45 --> 00:17:04,16

truthful i went away to tegra likes and i

204
00:17:04,16 --> 00:17:10,75
was on the leave work there. I was.
On the wire nettles road and also

205
00:17:10,76 --> 00:17:17,70

much work. Did you get per week on that

207
00:17:25,05 --> 00:17:31,12

exact wages. I think is only about

208
00:17:31,12 --> 00:17:34,27

209
00:17:34,27 --> 00:17:35,74

210
00:17:35,74 --> 00:17:41,52
a week on week off of something like

three pound at the time i can't remember

215
00:18:06,31 --> 00:18:13,27

went for people on the arch. Well they

217
00:18:18,06 --> 00:18:19,44
