1
00:00:02,36 --> 00:00:03,76
I'm talking to mr.

2
00:00:03,76 --> 00:00:08,25
Lynn irvine who worked on the sydney
harbour bridge on the approach is do you

3
00:00:08,25 --> 00:00:13,40
remember getting the job. Do you miss
trevor and i remember i remember getting

4
00:00:13,40 --> 00:00:18,57
a job but i don't remember the dates of
getting the job you know i worked there in

5
00:00:18,57 --> 00:00:24,50
three different periods each period
possibly as near as i can remember

6
00:00:25,39 --> 00:00:32,22
of three months. And of course i
did see we had or rather these

7
00:00:32,22 --> 00:00:38,68
people friends that i knew that got
me the job. They they this was their

8
00:00:38,68 --> 00:00:44,23
sort of trade. And me being out of
work they pushed me in and i did

9
00:00:44,23 --> 00:00:50,33
a job laboring what job exactly did you
do on the approaches we did the asphalt

10
00:00:50,33 --> 00:00:57,08
thing on the concrete
arches. There was i think

11
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:03,57
two or three layers of of asphalt on the
concrete. And then of course they put

12
00:01:03,57 --> 00:01:10,55
bricks over the top to protect the asphalt
and then they filled it in with rob

13
00:01:10,55 --> 00:01:15,14
on all kinds of filling and tied it so that
was actually the waterproofing for the

14
00:01:15,14 --> 00:01:21,37
for the arches of the artist yes.
Waterproofing. Was it hard work or it was very

15
00:01:21,37 --> 00:01:28,32
hard and of course spend. I was only.
I was only twenty one there as i

16
00:01:28,32 --> 00:01:34,07
can remember twenty one years of age. Two
member exactly what they work in teld

17
00:01:34,07 --> 00:01:40,76
what you had to have to do. Yes i. It
was my job to get the boilers or the

18
00:01:42,56 --> 00:01:48,69
house phone. Tubs ready for when the other
men came in and i used to have to leave

19
00:01:48,69 --> 00:01:55,02
home or 3:00 3:30 in the morning.
I lived in red from that time and

20
00:01:56,16 --> 00:02:02,16
i left home and have to walk right up to
the bridge approaches from red front which

21
00:02:02,16 --> 00:02:08,78
was quite all every morning and
i had to light the fires wood

22
00:02:08,78 --> 00:02:15,18
fires underneath the boilers. Put
the blocks of asphalt in the

23
00:02:16,53 --> 00:02:22,72
tubs. And melt it. Ready
for them coming at 7:30.

24
00:02:22,99 --> 00:02:29,24
They started it was really ready. But
it was near enough when they came and

25
00:02:30,16 --> 00:02:30,41
it was

26
00:02:30,41 --> 00:02:36,42
a matter of stirring it with big steel
paddles metal paddles and breaking it up

27
00:02:37,64 --> 00:02:41,85
till it was ready he used up stoke
the fire as well. Yes i had to stoke

28
00:02:41,85 --> 00:02:47,10
a fire as well. Yes i know how many of you
how many of these asphalt machines were

29
00:02:47,10 --> 00:02:50,74
there for the southern side you were
on the southern side. Yes i was on the

30
00:02:50,74 --> 00:02:57,50
southern side all the time. Actually there
weren't machines they were just these as

31
00:02:57,50 --> 00:03:04,22
i said these tubs boilers and we
used to have three normally and

32
00:03:04,23 --> 00:03:10,59
how many of you for them. Well. Well they
used to help when they came on i used to

33
00:03:10,59 --> 00:03:17,53
start it off get all the fires going
and get one near enough to ready for

34
00:03:17,53 --> 00:03:24,36
action and when they came in. Normally
they they marked it and sort of

35
00:03:24,36 --> 00:03:24,86
helped me

36
00:03:24,86 --> 00:03:29,99
a bit. And then when they were ready for
work and the stuff was ready to lay.

37
00:03:32,38 --> 00:03:37,94
Sometimes or more often than not. There
was another man to help me carry the

38
00:03:37,94 --> 00:03:44,67
buckets. It was it was ladled into buckets
and carried and lower down lower down

39
00:03:44,67 --> 00:03:49,48
out for them to get at the bottom and come
up with it. Putting it on the concrete

40
00:03:50,48 --> 00:03:53,93
and what did they do painted on a
porter now. Now they used a trowel

41
00:03:53,93 --> 00:04:00,90
a wooden wooden sort of float
to put it down with with wood.

42
00:04:00,92 --> 00:04:07,84
And they could work it and spread
it on to about i think that's how i

43
00:04:07,84 --> 00:04:14,73
think it finished up about an inch or inch
to court. I think took out two or three

44
00:04:14,73 --> 00:04:14,95
coats

45
00:04:14,95 --> 00:04:21,81
a notch or so you were responsible for
melting down and keeping molten all

46
00:04:21,81 --> 00:04:28,30
the asphalt for the southern approaches.
It's right yes yes i was and did you do

47
00:04:28,30 --> 00:04:34,63
the whole of the southern approaches.
Yes yes. Well it's amazing

48
00:04:34,63 --> 00:04:39,51
that there was another lot on the north
side. Well i don't know the north side

49
00:04:39,51 --> 00:04:46,27
didn't have any similar effort
at the. That we did the

50
00:04:46,28 --> 00:04:52,59
north side didn't have any of these arches
anyway. You see what it did but probably

51
00:04:52,59 --> 00:04:58,19
they weren't working at the same time as
you. Did they have well if you think about

52
00:04:58,19 --> 00:05:02,34
it. There's the fitzroy street out there
is the orchestrators that's eleven the

53
00:05:02,34 --> 00:05:08,11
street are never taken much notice over
there so of course i didn't know now. Yes

54
00:05:08,12 --> 00:05:09,04
well they must have been

55
00:05:09,04 --> 00:05:15,22
a separate contract altogether. Yes well
i didn't i wasn't aware that there was

56
00:05:15,22 --> 00:05:18,20
much done on the south
side so you see there's

57
00:05:18,20 --> 00:05:21,64
a you never can tell what's going on around
the place i know that if you look on

58
00:05:21,64 --> 00:05:22,36
the other side there's

59
00:05:22,36 --> 00:05:26,05
a terrific amount of arches there's
also the arches where the shops are and

60
00:05:26,05 --> 00:05:32,11
wilson's point station. I never thought
about that and then there's the police

61
00:05:32,11 --> 00:05:36,58
station the bridge police station which is
on the north side underneath the row was

62
00:05:36,59 --> 00:05:43,49
the row with it yes but that was in the
pile or not and it used to be on the

63
00:05:43,49 --> 00:05:48,56
demo the police station is actually in one
of the arches on the on the north side

64
00:05:49,90 --> 00:05:54,08
anyway. No i didn't realise that there was
so much in this i said but you learn all

65
00:05:54,08 --> 00:05:58,01
the time and it was amazing that there was
just you with three of these melters the

66
00:05:58,01 --> 00:06:04,94
whole lot you can you remember how long you
worked there. Well as i say no i can't

67
00:06:04,94 --> 00:06:06,49
it's it's it's

68
00:06:06,49 --> 00:06:12,66
a bit hazy times and you see i
think possibly three months

69
00:06:14,34 --> 00:06:19,45
each period. Possibly a bit more.
I don't know and we did you have

70
00:06:19,45 --> 00:06:26,15
a job in between terms of not well little
little bits and pieces of jobs you see we

71
00:06:26,16 --> 00:06:29,14
did we did little bits and
pieces we did a bit of

72
00:06:29,14 --> 00:06:34,95
a job on the top of wrigley's
spearmint factory. In between times

73
00:06:36,50 --> 00:06:38,95
we did another job at

74
00:06:38,95 --> 00:06:45,90
a cafe in town and i can't remember
which cafe. Do you remember the firm

75
00:06:45,90 --> 00:06:50,59
that was doing the subcontract that you
worked for well the it was the business and

76
00:06:50,59 --> 00:06:57,33
private was that that took the contract
that had the contract sublet you see

77
00:06:58,34 --> 00:07:01,12
. Other than that i i don't know there was

78
00:07:01,12 --> 00:07:07,73
a jack mitchell that worked with us. They
were all together about maybe five or

79
00:07:07,73 --> 00:07:14,24
six of us. There were six and yourself
six laying the asphalt as near as i

80
00:07:14,24 --> 00:07:18,44
yes. So look a lot of work
to do a lot of it was

81
00:07:18,44 --> 00:07:23,93
a very very hard work very hard to they had
to let the brick work to know. No doubt

82
00:07:23,93 --> 00:07:29,36
that again i'm not sure i think
that. I think that was a

83
00:07:29,36 --> 00:07:35,01
t partment of main roads it could have
been i'm not too sure when it was there is

84
00:07:35,01 --> 00:07:38,98
a public works department but who did what
and exactly how much nowadays i don't

85
00:07:38,98 --> 00:07:44,47
know but apparently did the people who had
the contract do any of the voting for

86
00:07:45,24 --> 00:07:51,87
for the city railway. No because the st
james and museum station were done in

87
00:07:51,87 --> 00:07:55,12
exactly the same way they were
all laid concrete then they put

88
00:07:55,12 --> 00:08:01,39
a spell then brick on top. Yes well
as the fellows that i worked with

89
00:08:01,39 --> 00:08:08,06
didn't do any of that i think that was
before. Wasn't it before the bridge.

90
00:08:08,13 --> 00:08:14,96
Yes. Well now i don't know about that
because i met these fellows in tarry

91
00:08:16,50 --> 00:08:19,87
that was where i met him i
was working in tari for

92
00:08:19,87 --> 00:08:26,69
a builder and it wasn't very good up there
but then again i didn't want the little

93
00:08:26,69 --> 00:08:31,22
country town you know how you know when
you're young. I want to do big city life

94
00:08:31,22 --> 00:08:34,73
and of course i packed up and
went to sydney which was

95
00:08:34,73 --> 00:08:40,70
a big mistake. Really why did you feel
that was work harder in sydney. No oh no i

96
00:08:40,70 --> 00:08:45,23
just i couldn't get the work i was in and
out of work and i was more out of work

97
00:08:45,23 --> 00:08:51,04
than in work harder to get and all of much
harder to get more competition down easy

98
00:08:51,04 --> 00:08:57,07
. Do you remember any more of the gangs
that they're working with he was just the

99
00:08:57,07 --> 00:09:03,49
six and yourself other than you
that at all. How are of our lot.

100
00:09:03,74 --> 00:09:08,17
Did you have anything to do with the concrete
as before. Who were public works. No

101
00:09:08,17 --> 00:09:14,74
other and passing time of the
day i used to. I watched them

102
00:09:15,73 --> 00:09:22,56
while we were on one of the archers. I
watched them put the shuttering timber and

103
00:09:22,56 --> 00:09:25,20
the reinforcing for the next arch.

104
00:09:25,20 --> 00:09:31,46
. And i well remember one man i'm not sure
if that was on the last arch that was

105
00:09:31,46 --> 00:09:38,02
the highest one man got on the he
climbed up to the top and he was just

106
00:09:38,02 --> 00:09:40,80
petrified with fear and they had

107
00:09:40,80 --> 00:09:46,90
a job to get him down he just clung and
they couldn't get him away. Did you do the

108
00:09:48,31 --> 00:09:54,75
. Over the eye go cut when they were
in that as well that you know. No.

109
00:09:57,21 --> 00:10:03,25
Unless you see unlet it was part of the
three arches to the approach as oh yes it

110
00:10:03,25 --> 00:10:07,87
was one of the three arches is that are
they. Well in we did i can't remember now

111
00:10:07,87 --> 00:10:08,51
you see it

112
00:10:08,51 --> 00:10:15,90
a little bit hazy and. I've been
around the argyle since. But i

113
00:10:15,91 --> 00:10:20,10
haven't taken much notice when he said
they blasted down the old arch ring which

114
00:10:20,10 --> 00:10:22,19
was kids turn and then they built

115
00:10:22,19 --> 00:10:25,82
a new one over the top because it had to
be an awful lot of wider and stronger. Yes

116
00:10:25,82 --> 00:10:30,40
. Well then we must have work time on because
i know we worked on the first second

117
00:10:30,40 --> 00:10:37,20
and third archers. And i worked with all
the time with the same to provos i've

118
00:10:37,20 --> 00:10:43,32
since tried to locate them but the
no name in the phone book and

119
00:10:44,45 --> 00:10:49,92
while they might be dead now because they
were about roughly seven years older than

120
00:10:49,92 --> 00:10:53,87
me which would put them to eighty. Where
did they come from they came from

121
00:10:53,87 --> 00:11:00,06
birmingham the two brothers and the the
other one the jack mitchell he came from

122
00:11:00,06 --> 00:11:05,14
london. They were came from london
one. I can't remember his name

123
00:11:07,62 --> 00:11:11,68
to me anything else about the work that
you member the working conditions. Well

124
00:11:11,68 --> 00:11:18,42
working conditions our conditions
were pretty primitive we didn't have

125
00:11:18,42 --> 00:11:25,20
any. Place to sit for lunch. We had to
sit outside. And if it did rain then

126
00:11:25,20 --> 00:11:31,77
we were just too bad we got wet. We
had no inside canteen or anything

127
00:11:31,77 --> 00:11:38,75
as such we sat night our sandwiches there
on the site. So working conditions

128
00:11:38,75 --> 00:11:45,56
just didn't exist. And toilet.
No we didn't have any

129
00:11:45,56 --> 00:11:49,88
toilet facilities at
all. You'd have to find

130
00:11:49,88 --> 00:11:54,45
a public toilet. Where we just had
to do the best we could. There's

131
00:11:54,45 --> 00:11:59,65
a long long wait. Of public toilets from
where we were. What sort of money did you

132
00:11:59,65 --> 00:12:06,28
get paid. Remember again roughly i'm not
too sure. I would say that when i did get

133
00:12:06,28 --> 00:12:11,24
up for a week possibly
round about six pounds

134
00:12:11,24 --> 00:12:16,08
a week that was good money then was there
was good money but is i said it was very

135
00:12:16,08 --> 00:12:21,92
very hard and hot work and what time to
do you started at sort of 3:00 in the

136
00:12:21,92 --> 00:12:26,23
morning i was supposed to start at five
o'clock in the morning to get the fires

137
00:12:26,23 --> 00:12:31,19
ready and i was away from home at 3:30 in
the morning from red fun because i had to

138
00:12:31,19 --> 00:12:36,25
get right down to the city through the
city right up to the approaches which was

139
00:12:36,25 --> 00:12:36,41
quite

140
00:12:36,41 --> 00:12:41,78
a walk. And of course i probably it took
me all more than an hour. I would say it's

141
00:12:41,78 --> 00:12:48,55
true that no trams. No i don't think there
were trams many case i couldn't afford

142
00:12:48,55 --> 00:12:55,41
them. I didn't have much money.
No days. Yes it's hard but

143
00:12:55,41 --> 00:12:59,12
the money when you got it was good but
you didn't you said when you did get

144
00:12:59,12 --> 00:13:01,10
a full week did that mean
that you very seldom got

145
00:13:01,10 --> 00:13:05,32
a full week. Well no we did get
for a week just sometimes we have

146
00:13:05,32 --> 00:13:11,35
a part possibly rained off. You know
with the weather. But when i did get

147
00:13:11,35 --> 00:13:13,77
a full week which i suppose was

148
00:13:13,77 --> 00:13:17,85
a reasonably regular i got
six pounds sometimes seven

149
00:13:17,85 --> 00:13:24,23
a dependent what i was doing is here and
of course in that time i had to pay back

150
00:13:24,24 --> 00:13:31,18
a little bit of the money to the my
landlady for digs that i hadn't been

151
00:13:31,18 --> 00:13:36,69
able to pay you know i'll have a lot.
She good like that of a good woman

152
00:13:36,69 --> 00:13:43,25
a very good very nice people.
Carl was their name. I

153
00:13:43,25 --> 00:13:47,79
haven't been able to locate any of the
family there either because i lived with

154
00:13:47,79 --> 00:13:54,70
some five years and so i really
got to know them whenever

155
00:13:54,71 --> 00:13:59,30
you were out of work and couldn't pay they
used to worry me they didn't want to me

156
00:13:59,30 --> 00:14:04,53
they they actually have to do
it. When i could when i did get

157
00:14:04,53 --> 00:14:11,30
a bit of work. I gave them most of my
money. I never spent much on myself.

158
00:14:11,53 --> 00:14:15,100
I didn't think i couldn't
afford to then i did smoke.

159
00:14:19,05 --> 00:14:25,96
I didn't buy much by way of clothing. I
could still i couldn't afford that so

160
00:14:28,14 --> 00:14:33,62
that was it. One more thing before we
go for the work and the things. Do you

161
00:14:33,62 --> 00:14:37,92
remember what time you finished work. Oh
yes. I usually finish around five o'clock

162
00:14:37,92 --> 00:14:40,11
at night so that was

163
00:14:40,11 --> 00:14:45,99
a twelve hour day for you. It was oh yes
twelve hours plus. It used to have to

164
00:14:45,99 --> 00:14:50,98
watch them well they say well they're cool
turn as well. The. No no. What we did

165
00:14:50,98 --> 00:14:56,70
you see when the cool down. We used to have
to clean them out the boilers and then

166
00:14:56,70 --> 00:15:02,34
once a week as they emptied
we had to they had a they had

167
00:15:02,34 --> 00:15:07,61
a detachable bottom inside
that we used to knock out with

168
00:15:07,61 --> 00:15:13,60
a fourteen pound hammer. You see by the
end of the week inside of the pot. It was

169
00:15:13,60 --> 00:15:19,34
built up with layers of hard hard rock hard
asphalt you see. And we used to have to

170
00:15:19,34 --> 00:15:22,18
smash the bottom out with

171
00:15:22,18 --> 00:15:28,100
a fourteen pound hammer and then
clean the rock asphalt off the

172
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,02
sides you see clean them and set them up
again for monday morning. That was always

173
00:15:34,02 --> 00:15:36,34
on a saturday afternoon or on

174
00:15:36,34 --> 00:15:41,16
a friday afternoon saturday
morning we did that. We you were

175
00:15:41,16 --> 00:15:44,81
a union member. While you're working on the
bridge. No i didn't know what union was

176
00:15:44,81 --> 00:15:51,63
i never. I think i'm not sure i think i
joined the union once in the world as union

177
00:15:51,63 --> 00:15:53,47
but was that the b.w.

178
00:15:53,47 --> 00:15:59,36
Were you i think it was i don't
think i couldn't i couldn't have

179
00:15:59,36 --> 00:16:03,14
a panic subscriptions anyway and ever i
never had much money to do this when you

180
00:16:03,14 --> 00:16:09,55
see. And of course unions in nose days who
were there are strong as they are now.

181
00:16:09,71 --> 00:16:10,85
And yes there was

182
00:16:10,85 --> 00:16:17,49
a preference for union this enforced on
the bridge. Oh yes yes but as i said

183
00:16:17,49 --> 00:16:24,36
before trade unionism
wasn't strong and we were

184
00:16:24,36 --> 00:16:31,10
never in the union. I know that i think
you are going back to depression times

185
00:16:31,96 --> 00:16:35,14
before they got you've got the job you were
from england originally how did you get

186
00:16:35,14 --> 00:16:41,82
to australia. Well week i came
out under the the. Tread not

187
00:16:41,82 --> 00:16:47,24
boys scheme. It was an immigration scheme
for bringing boys from england. I was

188
00:16:47,24 --> 00:16:53,35
eighteen just just turned
eighteen. And we sailed

189
00:16:54,49 --> 00:17:01,47
on the bendigo yes as bendigo
from tilbury docks. I think the

190
00:17:01,48 --> 00:17:06,75
twenty eight 27th or 28th of april 1927.
