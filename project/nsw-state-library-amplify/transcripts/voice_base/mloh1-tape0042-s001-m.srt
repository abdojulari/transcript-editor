a very difficult to erect
those no no no no i was in

109
00:10:26,63 --> 00:10:32,03
a difficult. I first it became
a bit different. Yeah excel is

110
00:10:32,03 --> 00:10:38,15
a big range said in travelling
over the bridge there where

111
00:10:39,50 --> 00:10:39,74
they have

112
00:10:39,74 --> 00:10:46,66
a director that they are on the wrong
side and there are smaller cranes

113
00:10:46,66 --> 00:10:52,44

grange we are erected to where liberator

116
00:11:06,29 --> 00:11:12,45
on the day came in first of
all the cranes on the very

117
00:11:13,50 --> 00:11:20,39
very very links where the. Two basch
you know they're not really basis.

118
00:11:20,70 --> 00:11:27,16
You know really basic stars. Call them
the kind of apartment towers. That

119
00:11:27,16 --> 00:11:30,83
tower stay yet they're there
a button and they don't hold

120
00:11:30,83 --> 00:11:36,32
a bridge and bridge race and.
On the bearings in this q-bot

121
00:11:37,91 --> 00:11:44,25
and then something you know to
stretch you know all the wires

122
00:11:45,28 --> 00:11:51,99
cameron's going to do a
whole. They range have

123
00:11:51,99 --> 00:11:58,41
a there and then we had
tenants dug under the rock

124
00:11:59,49 --> 00:12:05,80
and right around of course
there'll be a link to half

125
00:12:05,81 --> 00:12:12,06
a mile to get the coming and going. Of the

126
00:12:13,01 --> 00:12:19,84
. Sick. Going through the day again. Port

127
00:12:19,85 --> 00:12:26,02
said i mean you were you ran them drowned
through the through the tunnels to do

128
00:12:26,02 --> 00:12:32,98
this you shake. Ok then as when they're
around. Actually the canvassing

129
00:12:32,98 --> 00:12:35,83
closest. Large scale

130
00:12:35,83 --> 00:12:42,77
a rock and then cross it and questioning

131
00:12:42,77 --> 00:12:48,90
kevin's where not directly on the
rock was the he had thick plates and

132
00:12:49,90 --> 00:12:56,60
riding camels from whom we wear and tear.
To collecting in from cutting into the

133
00:12:56,60 --> 00:13:01,20
rock and so how did you go about
threading it through. Did you start with

134
00:13:01,20 --> 00:13:07,83
a small telegraph rope
so to speak. Yes yes i

135
00:13:07,83 --> 00:13:13,63
thin k that's thin thin
thin no wires ropes. No.

136
00:13:15,29 --> 00:13:22,26
Golden. Am true love.
Through the tunnel turning

137
00:13:22,26 --> 00:13:22,45
over

138
00:13:22,45 --> 00:13:29,64
a satellite and when that was over when

139
00:13:29,64 --> 00:13:36,18
i met you you were right. You must have
erected the creeper crane before then. Yes

140
00:13:36,19 --> 00:13:41,10
because the crane about the first and the
next. Do you remember what it was hard to

141
00:13:41,10 --> 00:13:46,36
erect the jib of the creeper crane where
you would we working on that. Our current

142
00:13:48,25 --> 00:13:55,01
crane you know she goes to auburn
when either side yet i was

143
00:13:55,01 --> 00:13:59,02
talking to harry tom rob he's dead now
but he worked on the other side and he

144
00:13:59,02 --> 00:13:59,43
reckoned as

145
00:13:59,43 --> 00:14:04,97
a he was on he started is. His career at
sea under sail and he said the hardest

146
00:14:04,97 --> 00:14:09,57
thing i ever had to do was to erect in his
life was directly the tip of the creeper

147
00:14:09,57 --> 00:14:12,34
grain camera and when exactly

148
00:14:17,09 --> 00:14:20,67
it grieved that crane estada
right from turnley was

149
00:14:20,67 --> 00:14:27,27
a horrid. I told arch top top there

150
00:14:28,92 --> 00:14:32,59
and that was

151
00:14:32,59 --> 00:14:37,74
a wreck that on top of things. It was
very much harder than any abertay job.

152
00:14:40,24 --> 00:14:46,15
Could have been and it could have been
jangling down. The way for four to

153
00:14:47,51 --> 00:14:53,46
poorer for nine months then you know
all the air inside straight here.

154
00:14:54,74 --> 00:14:58,90
And when i come back. There was

155
00:14:58,90 --> 00:15:05,76
a lot already done and the hardest

156
00:15:05,76 --> 00:15:12,63
work. I found was. Most unpleasant
was right and on top of the

157
00:15:12,63 --> 00:15:19,31
ij. And they are acting out of danger
gosh mean and so forth in which we

158
00:15:19,31 --> 00:15:24,100
never goes away. It is very strange
there when i came back was very

159
00:15:26,03 --> 00:15:27,20
chilly and

160
00:15:27,21 --> 00:15:33,33
a blue like hell and. Strong on top there

161
00:15:35,05 --> 00:15:41,34
but there was nothing to hang
on to. Yes. No. Well we had

162
00:15:41,34 --> 00:15:47,59
a proper action plan for erecting
fafsa form side. He even poor

163
00:15:47,59 --> 00:15:54,53
people very very tense. Had to be
platforms and for there we won't flee

164
00:15:54,53 --> 00:15:58,27
in the steel erection gang or where you
were just directing scaffolding and such

165
00:15:58,27 --> 00:16:04,99
like i was only acting scaffolding now and
again my street time image here action.

166
00:16:06,09 --> 00:16:09,97
So jack harris was the one who who was
he was acting as dogman in the steel

167
00:16:09,97 --> 00:16:15,89
erecting going to you know remember how
many there were in the foreman. But he was

168
00:16:15,89 --> 00:16:20,53
also acting as dogman and in the erection
of the steel wasn't who he was and yet i

169
00:16:20,53 --> 00:16:26,59
was only in order to say yeah yeah. You
were on the south side where they showed

170
00:16:26,59 --> 00:16:31,30
side. Well you might remember harry

00:17:10,37 --> 00:17:10,65
writing

176
00:17:11,64 --> 00:17:18,56
a shot at the major mind when strange
things was we'd class langston

177
00:17:19,43 --> 00:17:26,34
swims. Do you remember who was the
crane driver the creeper crane driver.

178
00:17:29,91 --> 00:17:33,84
Now i don't. Quite

179
00:17:33,85 --> 00:17:39,96
a few crane drivers and the job. Of the
carpenter shop on nelson's poor and the

180
00:17:40,84 --> 00:17:47,83
south side. When they say yeah yeah.
And then they said they shop. I

181
00:17:47,83 --> 00:17:53,70
don't shop for that and who's who and
who did you know jackeroo in those days

182
00:17:55,04 --> 00:18:01,09
i tell you i don't have renters who saw him
here in time so i let him lots of time

183
00:18:01,09 --> 00:18:07,10
since then usually because i was with the
public works the pipes and he was with

184
00:18:07,10 --> 00:18:12,78
these contractors working for us. You
didn't know him but he his father was the

185
00:18:12,78 --> 00:18:19,26
caretaker and he lived in doorman long's
office. I knew that i i know i don't. He

186
00:18:19,26 --> 00:18:25,43
always living there somewhere near there.
He was and. On the other side. Yeah.

187
00:18:27,55 --> 00:18:30,66
So when you when you went away before you
went away. You were on the militants

188
00:18:30,66 --> 00:18:35,53
point side and when you came back to the
job you were on the south side and he's

189
00:18:35,53 --> 00:18:40,25
outside. I started only on the side in

190
00:18:40,25 --> 00:18:46,73
a direction to the shops. I started again

191
00:18:47,59 --> 00:18:52,72
on the side when you started again on the
south side can you remember where the

192
00:18:52,72 --> 00:18:57,31
bridge was to how far up it was
by that and i started earning

193
00:18:57,31 --> 00:19:04,02
a show. It showed. It was surreal. There
you know you know you know i just used

194
00:19:04,02 --> 00:19:10,96
ideas that you being we
self insure for the you

195
00:19:10,97 --> 00:19:12,07
know steel erecting

196
00:19:12,07 --> 00:19:18,79
a you know doing the preparatory work and

197
00:19:18,80 --> 00:19:25,68
this is what we have our 1926.
Seven when you came back. Where

198
00:19:25,69 --> 00:19:31,81
were they have our back then. That's
when i come back. And you know they.

199
00:19:32,79 --> 00:19:37,67
When you come back they hadn't got very
far either. And he stayed there all the

200
00:19:37,67 --> 00:19:43,64
rest of the time till 1930 one
or two did too. I think to

201
00:19:45,05 --> 00:19:51,92
begin beginning to end the

202
00:19:54,29 --> 00:19:57,54
bridge was opened. You know that there's

203
00:19:57,54 --> 00:20:01,52
a you know anti-state and he's just

204
00:20:01,52 --> 00:20:07,70
a special five shilling you
know major al qaeda there

205
00:20:09,86 --> 00:20:15,17
who was your your foreman on the south
side of jackaroos on the north side it was

206
00:20:15,17 --> 00:20:21,64
your foreman i'm not on the south side in
steam and that wasn't the steeler acting

207
00:20:21,64 --> 00:20:28,26
going on the sound side was it.
Experience do you actually make

208
00:20:28,26 --> 00:20:35,25
range about why we started erecting these
steel. You know to end on and progress

209
00:20:35,25 --> 00:20:42,18
on their own. I was just that i was told
that ben tucker was the was the one who

210
00:20:42,18 --> 00:20:48,26
was doing the dogman work on on the
sound side they could have been

211
00:20:52,05 --> 00:20:58,16
. You bring back memories to me. I

212
00:20:59,49 --> 00:21:05,24
completely lost their sense of who

213
00:21:07,14 --> 00:21:08,49
they want you to be

214
00:21:08,49 --> 00:21:16,12
a few people very well no. Felix
faulkner do you know i don't think

215
00:21:16,12 --> 00:21:22,57
alex faulkner he was killed
or faulkner pork now

216
00:21:23,58 --> 00:21:25,68
you know it's

217
00:21:25,69 --> 00:21:30,62
a lie. Was he doing it. Well he was one of
the steeler actors and he was killed on

218
00:21:30,62 --> 00:21:33,04
the deck level when he
was acting as dogman and

219
00:21:33,04 --> 00:21:39,37
a piece of steel crane keep light
fell down and cut his leg off. Yeah i

220
00:21:39,38 --> 00:21:43,44
read and i read there

221
00:21:47,34 --> 00:21:52,07

accident. And somebody having

223
00:21:54,63 --> 00:22:01,63
a condom and who it was. I can't even
remember any names or guys who fell

224
00:22:01,64 --> 00:22:08,14

It was one it fell off and survived

225
00:22:08,92 --> 00:22:14,90
that. Yeah that's one. Yeah. And
then yeah they go in there. Yeah

226
00:22:15,97 --> 00:22:16,39

227
00:22:16,39 --> 00:22:23,37
a foreman. Yeah i remember frank
doyle. Right. When he was

228
00:22:23,37 --> 00:22:29,74

a hero. Who's here. He'll

236
00:23:22,90 --> 00:23:27,57

00:23:44,10 --> 00:23:50,67
and they him they're here around the
globe. I like camaraderie and he

240
00:23:51,55 --> 00:23:52,00
he was

241
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:59,18
a cheap. If he was in charge
of erection wasn't he. He

242
00:23:59,19 --> 00:24:05,66
was in charge of in all directions. The
whole bridge. Remember muir who james muir

243
00:24:05,66 --> 00:24:11,41
re-airs yeah. And yeah. What was
his job as far as you could say

244
00:24:13,28 --> 00:24:18,26
they were married and he was
any way that i'm you know

245
00:24:21,93 --> 00:24:28,80
any engineer too. He was in charge of
the substructure at all the stonework

246
00:24:28,80 --> 00:24:30,59
on the concrete and the pylons

247
00:24:36,19 --> 00:24:42,99
to dubai had nothing to do
with you. Storm like this

248
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:49,14
stone storms gave me coursed and.

249
00:24:54,36 --> 00:25:01,09
I don't know what you're involved
in an accident or so. Were you

250
00:25:01,09 --> 00:25:07,51
involved in any accidents yourself.
You know. You know i you know

251
00:25:08,56 --> 00:25:12,41
two and a lot of blood packs

252
00:25:12,41 --> 00:25:15,92
a very important rule there
on the bridge. Probably

253
00:25:16,98 --> 00:25:22,83
a chilly weather so called not as
cold as finland that's for sure.

254
00:25:25,21 --> 00:25:31,61
You know and then you know
he's calling out what they

255
00:25:31,62 --> 00:25:36,62
expect. And it could be

256
00:25:36,62 --> 00:25:43,45
a very very call. And i pray you.

257
00:25:43,47 --> 00:25:44,28
Don't get

258
00:25:45,40 --> 00:25:47,96
a very very great deal
of information obviously

259
00:25:50,51 --> 00:25:54,86
a long time and i had checked the multitude
of jobs since then. Where did you go

260
00:25:54,86 --> 00:26:01,33
after that there are said
that i wonder why larry

00:26:01,33 --> 00:26:08,10

so forth. And finally last job.

264
00:26:23,63 --> 00:26:30,19

00:27:14,01 --> 00:27:20,99
. By applying. And broke and broken

272
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:26,62
hill and even closer and

273
00:27:28,71 --> 00:27:31,44
very down which was

274
00:27:31,44 --> 00:27:38,09
a very brain when over want
to cross the mountains to

275
00:27:40,80 --> 00:27:47,68
do what you know the place to
work for you get to go to and

276

Sure you are

280
00:28:10,44 --> 00:28:17,79
a little yeah yeah that's right.
That's next. Occurred to me and

281
00:28:22,07 --> 00:28:28,16
that time i was living in the mega long
wiley you know public works. House and

282
00:28:29,13 --> 00:28:33,74
. At that stage. I've been in

283
00:28:33,74 --> 00:28:39,26
a motel they do that in public works where

284
00:28:39,26 --> 00:28:42,39
a country job was more
like jobs being some big

285
00:28:42,39 --> 00:28:48,95
a job and to go much more water

286
00:28:48,95 --> 00:28:55,03
supply. You weren't
married. You know and i

287
00:28:55,95 --> 00:29:01,77
mean you know why. Teddy sixteen.
They work when with you everywhere.

288
00:29:02,99 --> 00:29:08,47
My wife stayed here. He used the
engine helio flatly and see me here

289
00:29:11,10 --> 00:29:17,76
and i finish reading public works
on the water supply and hands

290
00:29:17,76 --> 00:29:20,84
factor.

291
00:29:24,68 --> 00:29:30,43
That once in a really
bad night that you're

292
00:29:30,43 --> 00:29:37,14
a very very very good can see and you
asked. And then came the mcclain

293
00:29:38,62 --> 00:29:45,25
a morning supply to them was the work

294
00:29:45,25 --> 00:29:48,01
comparatively easy at that just expecting

295
00:29:48,01 --> 00:29:54,19
a real change. You know. All
the time and charge of the

296
00:29:55,01 --> 00:30:01,56
contract workers contract.

297
00:30:01,58 --> 00:30:06,38
Contract terms. That's where i met
jack ruby again he was working with

298
00:30:06,38 --> 00:30:09,53
a contract. He had

299
00:30:09,53 --> 00:30:16,31
a welding consultancy of his own
that. My right and i mean are you

300
00:30:16,31 --> 00:30:23,20
talking about. Before his retirement i
suppose that would be about i mean here

301
00:30:23,20 --> 00:30:27,45
is tired. Probably why you're

302
00:30:27,46 --> 00:30:33,54
a lot older than him here picking here.
And how do you know. These clients

303
00:30:35,51 --> 00:30:37,72
. I've just been talking to
somebody was ninety nine.
