1
00:00:07,32 --> 00:00:09,31
Yes it's running now. This is mr.

2
00:00:09,31 --> 00:00:14,57
Jack crew recording at his home. And mr.

3
00:00:14,57 --> 00:00:19,34
Jack drew you. You remember the days when
you worked for dorman long. What was your

4
00:00:19,34 --> 00:00:25,91
job. First of all i was an office
boy i started in the office at

5
00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:33,95
the age of fourteen and said i turned
sixteen. I know it's my time as

6
00:00:33,95 --> 00:00:40,24
a boilermaker. Then after
the eno all the shops

7
00:00:40,24 --> 00:00:46,16
closed and everybody finished. And
i got a job on the outside as

8
00:00:46,16 --> 00:00:51,56
a signal boy. You know. And one
of the cranes on the pylon

9
00:00:53,41 --> 00:00:59,84
and i was there for about six weeks
after they open. You were never

10
00:00:59,84 --> 00:01:02,87
a painter on the bridge. No never fired

11
00:01:02,87 --> 00:01:09,02
a. You when the crane was pulled
down. I was assisting the painters

12
00:01:10,55 --> 00:01:13,09
. But never what was

13
00:01:13,09 --> 00:01:19,15
a signal boy on the on the crane. If you
will the dog when he was down below.

14
00:01:21,51 --> 00:01:26,50
Because the cry and i couldn't see him.
And i was about in the ledge. You know on

15
00:01:26,50 --> 00:01:31,90
the south pylon and i had to relay
the signals from the document as

16
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:38,70
a kind of. That's when you weren't
using the telephone. No telephones

17
00:01:38,70 --> 00:01:45,27
wasn't invented in those days.
Oh well actually they were but

18
00:01:48,29 --> 00:01:55,19
it was more economical to have
somebody out on the ledge. Did they

19
00:01:55,19 --> 00:02:01,82
ever relay whistle signals. It
wouldn't be able to hear them.

20
00:02:01,84 --> 00:02:05,88
Well can you tell me what you did when
you first started as an office boy

21
00:02:05,88 --> 00:02:10,26
a member of the office. Do you work there
live there didn't you. Yeah. The father

22
00:02:10,26 --> 00:02:10,35
was

23
00:02:10,35 --> 00:02:17,39
a caretaker on you know
in the office. And.

24
00:02:18,29 --> 00:02:23,88
When i went down there. I had
better eleven years of age. But

25
00:02:25,37 --> 00:02:28,71
you're not left school at
the age of fourteen. I got

26
00:02:28,71 --> 00:02:34,99
a job in office given and the
message is doing to my oh

27
00:02:35,97 --> 00:02:41,80
you're going up ahead of
us and peds. And all that.

28
00:02:44,13 --> 00:02:50,39
And then when you went over to the
workshops. Oh i know that. Thomas ball

29
00:02:53,17 --> 00:02:55,82
and whereabouts just out there what it
what we are doing when you went over there

30
00:02:55,82 --> 00:03:02,54
first. The first couple of
months i was i was up in

31
00:03:02,55 --> 00:03:03,92
the morning and

32
00:03:03,92 --> 00:03:10,01
a temperate flow. And it went down below
into the actually into the workshop

33
00:03:11,47 --> 00:03:14,17
. And the first six
months of the time it was

34
00:03:14,17 --> 00:03:20,03
a billy boy. And all kinds of things.

35
00:03:21,75 --> 00:03:28,53
Did you do any marking out there and
then what did you assembling or not as

36
00:03:28,53 --> 00:03:33,38
assembly you don't. You didn't mark and

37
00:03:33,38 --> 00:03:39,18
a lot of assembling you riveting. You know
and all that. Yes what do you remember

38
00:03:39,18 --> 00:03:43,42
best about the workshops.
You've got to remember best

39
00:03:46,28 --> 00:03:51,96
. You didn't have time to remember. The
very most because it was work and not like

40
00:03:51,96 --> 00:03:58,70
it is today. You know but the
conditions of the workers. Pretty

41
00:03:58,71 --> 00:04:04,76
bloody. You know in comparison

42
00:04:06,67 --> 00:04:13,26
you working conditions today. Well
it was entirely different you know

43
00:04:13,26 --> 00:04:19,05
dressing rooms no. Shower room.
You know anything like that.

44
00:04:21,16 --> 00:04:27,42
I started of that i don't think the
work. I don't. Surely there were

45
00:04:27,42 --> 00:04:33,76
a lot of money with. A dollar

46
00:04:33,76 --> 00:04:35,85
a day isn't much now but it was i suppose

47
00:04:35,85 --> 00:04:41,50
a bit in those days. How much was it. Oh
well it was a teenage shillings it was

48
00:04:42,63 --> 00:04:48,99
a fair bit of money. You know comparison
to what they get the day because

49
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:54,95
conditions are entirely different you
know. And went to nueva and all that.

50
00:04:56,86 --> 00:05:03,71
But they had to work. And
if you didn't work. All

51
00:05:04,81 --> 00:05:11,18
they want to know why do you remember any

52
00:05:11,18 --> 00:05:16,10
accidents or any tragic incidents in the
workshops or the bridge. I mean the

53
00:05:16,10 --> 00:05:22,89
workshop. There was and. You one chap was

54
00:05:22,89 --> 00:05:28,49
up on one of the kind and it was greasing
it. And some of these start at all. I

55
00:05:28,49 --> 00:05:35,37
think that you caught in the
cogs. And i think for men.

56
00:05:35,38 --> 00:05:42,26
We legs were. A cut of. About

57
00:05:43,20 --> 00:05:49,97
. As apart from that. Well i can't
remember to remember out on the bridge

58
00:05:50,69 --> 00:05:57,22
an accident there or any accident there.
The last chap that you fell off the bridge

59
00:05:57,22 --> 00:06:04,20
. I think his name was campbell. It was out
on the needle. You know supporting the

60
00:06:06,11 --> 00:06:11,16
ugandans for washing down the pilots
and you have that balance and

61
00:06:13,80 --> 00:06:18,01
you fell onto the deck and
then you went through the

62
00:06:22,08 --> 00:06:24,45
the rail i sleep you down at the bottom.

63
00:06:29,54 --> 00:06:30,03
You know with

64
00:06:30,03 --> 00:06:36,62
a well i did next election and but i
just you just seen what happened. I mean

65
00:06:39,65 --> 00:06:45,20
did you know kelly another man who fell
off. Now i don't remember him because he

66
00:06:45,20 --> 00:06:45,31
was

67
00:06:45,31 --> 00:06:51,85
a it was up on the guard when i was in the
shop. But i believe you when they picked

68
00:06:51,85 --> 00:06:58,54
him out of the water is. You know all
this close to or who any beaches that

69
00:06:58,54 --> 00:07:04,33
you know where they break
open to the bottom. I did.

70
00:07:05,78 --> 00:07:10,85
That wouldn't like to try to find out. Do
you remember any amusing things at the

71
00:07:10,85 --> 00:07:17,48
workshop do you remember lunch hour or
anything around there then. Oh then the

72
00:07:17,48 --> 00:07:18,50
lunch out there to have

73
00:07:19,91 --> 00:07:24,60
a crown an anger board. Jarvis
and all that kind of carry on

74
00:07:27,17 --> 00:07:33,87
. But you get the fantasies.
We used to sneak out the side

75
00:07:33,87 --> 00:07:40,86
and go over the leaven to buy bars.
You know it's in the summertime.

76
00:07:40,88 --> 00:07:43,41
And. And that was

77
00:07:43,41 --> 00:07:48,93
a hole in the tin and you know as

78
00:07:48,93 --> 00:07:55,71
a couple of times. The boss was white
and for us when we come back. He

79
00:07:55,71 --> 00:07:56,01
give us

80
00:07:56,01 --> 00:08:02,94
a play. Do you remember.

81
00:08:02,96 --> 00:08:07,63
The methods of work in the workshops to
remember how how the steel came in and that

82
00:08:07,63 --> 00:08:13,74
went through the workshop can you describe
it to you you. Well the steel used to

83
00:08:13,74 --> 00:08:20,56
come in by ship. I mean given
you know they floated there

84
00:08:20,56 --> 00:08:26,38
and you then conveyed enter
that. Into the marking of buys

85
00:08:29,27 --> 00:08:35,49
it and you know all the steel was
coated boy or some kind of gluey stuff

86
00:08:36,38 --> 00:08:42,17
. You know it was very hard to get over it
all at the beginning and you taken over

87
00:08:42,17 --> 00:08:46,91
by hand and you we're yesterday.
They did and you get tagged along

88
00:08:47,66 --> 00:08:54,12
a you dip it in an acid
bath. Or the sand glass it.

89
00:08:55,46 --> 00:09:02,26
Much easier. You know what
makes you what do you

90
00:09:02,26 --> 00:09:09,22
mean next. Well first of

91
00:09:09,22 --> 00:09:15,55
all the steel. Yes to go up
to the marking of by you then

92
00:09:16,73 --> 00:09:23,67
you go to drillers. Then they'd go to
the assembly. And after us all the

93
00:09:23,67 --> 00:09:26,22
same but got a. What they called

94
00:09:26,22 --> 00:09:33,15
a heavy shop and it will
be that it. And it go

95
00:09:33,15 --> 00:09:36,00
onto a pontoon in

96
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:42,93
a dock as your floated out
for the arch. How do you

97
00:09:42,93 --> 00:09:46,83
remember the you describe
what it was like in

98
00:09:46,83 --> 00:09:53,69
a riveting game what exactly
went on. Bloody at work. Well

99
00:09:53,70 --> 00:10:00,37
there was the river do
the hold up the cook.

100
00:10:01,99 --> 00:10:02,00
As

101
00:10:02,01 --> 00:10:10,36
a catcher. You know it
was in the gang and. You

102
00:10:10,37 --> 00:10:15,64
when they had it. You know the hydraulically
that is you know it was an extra

103
00:10:15,64 --> 00:10:20,75
couple to drag hoses and there was also

104
00:10:20,75 --> 00:10:24,83
a gantry. And you know.

105
00:10:29,20 --> 00:10:33,56
The big machine. Oh there was

106
00:10:33,56 --> 00:10:38,86
a figure out you know but you
know millie in an ordinary with

107
00:10:38,86 --> 00:10:43,40
a cane. It was the riveter the hold up as

108
00:10:43,41 --> 00:10:48,41
a cook in the kitchen and what was
the process as it went through

109
00:10:52,82 --> 00:10:59,06
everything. You covered with red led. You
know before it was assembled. I mean the

110
00:10:59,06 --> 00:11:04,38
riveting process so how does it start. So
with the cook at it yet. Yes that's right

111
00:11:05,12 --> 00:11:11,88
and they apply that to the kitchen.
And i'd put in the how and

112
00:11:11,88 --> 00:11:12,68
how old i am but

113
00:11:12,68 --> 00:11:19,63
a get under it and root of
the day the rest of the

114
00:11:20,40 --> 00:11:27,36
the holder it was compressed
air too so what is he got

115
00:11:27,36 --> 00:11:28,10
it's like

116
00:11:28,10 --> 00:11:34,78
a riveting machine like an area bitter at
the back as well as the front as it will

117
00:11:34,79 --> 00:11:37,60
actually as a holder have

118
00:11:37,60 --> 00:11:43,81
a fixed machine. You know get
onto it and tighten it up and

119
00:11:45,77 --> 00:11:52,39
. Then the river is on the other side. Was
there any difference in with the machine

120
00:11:52,39 --> 00:11:59,32
that they hold up used on the rivet
abused. Oh no i don't think so. I would

121
00:11:59,32 --> 00:12:06,29
like to riveting machines being away
together and unless you're into older you

122
00:12:06,29 --> 00:12:12,30
got to do that in and they had
ended up with learned stop.

123
00:12:13,22 --> 00:12:19,87
And all it do was wait until the river.
If you if you finished any dismantle. It

124
00:12:20,64 --> 00:12:27,62
. Take it to rivet it gone to the next
one. Did you were never holding up. Of

125
00:12:27,62 --> 00:12:28,73
course because europe. You were

126
00:12:28,73 --> 00:12:33,49
a princess boilermaker so you only
actually did you did the riveting as

127
00:12:33,49 --> 00:12:39,64
a riveter. Are you part
of. Can you remember

128
00:12:40,79 --> 00:12:45,76
any more amusing times that happened
around the place. It's it's

129
00:12:45,76 --> 00:12:47,59
a long time to it's

130
00:12:47,59 --> 00:12:54,42
a long time to go back and i know

131
00:12:55,16 --> 00:12:56,10
it you're

132
00:12:57,10 --> 00:13:01,11
a you when you was that age. It was always
getting you know you know getting up to

133
00:13:01,11 --> 00:13:07,64
addict. But i can't remember any and
he's any special. Do you remember

134
00:13:07,64 --> 00:13:13,23
being around the office doing what it was
like around the office. Oh yes. Good good

135
00:13:13,23 --> 00:13:16,34
. I mean i don't think i
was ever cut out the be

136
00:13:17,37 --> 00:13:22,50
a no office. I was that girl

137
00:13:25,70 --> 00:13:32,14
. At. You wasn't

138
00:13:32,14 --> 00:13:38,51
venturous enough for me in our eyes to
look out and say i'm up on the steel.

139
00:13:39,35 --> 00:13:45,14
Do you just never really place i mean
did you used to go up before you were

140
00:13:45,14 --> 00:13:48,76
actually allowed to go before you were
working out there. Oh yeah you know in the

141
00:13:48,76 --> 00:13:52,03
lunch you know it's

142
00:13:52,03 --> 00:13:58,80
a sneak up there. And what you
do when you get up there are

143
00:13:58,80 --> 00:14:03,71
a good look around make bloody sure
it was back to you back on time.

144
00:14:06,35 --> 00:14:12,74
Do you remember when you were
finished up on the bridge. Oh

145
00:14:17,28 --> 00:14:22,19
no it just you finished up because everything
was you know everything was working

146
00:14:22,19 --> 00:14:29,18
and all that. So what did you do then what
happened to you. And we all went up to

147
00:14:30,20 --> 00:14:35,64
brisbane in anticipation of the exhibition
but we were about three or four or five

148
00:14:35,64 --> 00:14:42,38
years too early but we you
know was on the dole. I

149
00:14:42,38 --> 00:14:47,14
think we used to get six shillings
a week a year. One week and

150
00:14:47,14 --> 00:14:54,01
a day's work the next week that so
that i mean and six. But you there

151
00:14:54,01 --> 00:14:55,95
were four of us living in a house you know

152
00:14:56,70 --> 00:15:03,29
a good or not. Right. What about when
you came back from brisbane and all the

153
00:15:03,29 --> 00:15:03,81
father had

154
00:15:03,81 --> 00:15:10,78
a shop that you can think then. And i
used to helping in it you know there

155
00:15:11,71 --> 00:15:13,30
in the meantime i'd be out looking for

156
00:15:13,30 --> 00:15:20,27
a job every morning. But it was
no work about. You go down

157
00:15:20,27 --> 00:15:27,19
and. Eat you places and that doesn't
mean you know stand outside

158
00:15:30,47 --> 00:15:35,91
. It then the boss would come out and
know of it. After leaving it there for

159
00:15:35,91 --> 00:15:41,90
a couple of hours. But that
is the first time i got to

160
00:15:42,94 --> 00:15:49,92
you know back end of the side
without the i just botany. Working

161
00:15:49,92 --> 00:15:50,88
at automatic

162
00:15:50,88 --> 00:15:57,55
a world english scene which i never
certainly like. But i still managed to do

163
00:16:00,10 --> 00:16:06,99
it then i went to sydney
steel merrick all. I

164
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,97
was i started in 1935. And you went

165
00:16:13,97 --> 00:16:20,95
down to the grave. We were you
building the case and and i got

166
00:16:20,95 --> 00:16:22,16
a job with the navy is

167
00:16:23,66 --> 00:16:30,60
a new building at sea. Which is
quite good. If you first of all

168
00:16:30,60 --> 00:16:36,95
i know that you will. It's
dock. And you were building as

169
00:16:36,95 --> 00:16:43,55
a floating dock. Actually i was
attached more to dock. And

170
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:49,26
anyhow i left there to go as the
world. Ing supervisor for the vacuum

171
00:16:49,26 --> 00:16:55,43
a little company and in 1960. I left there

172
00:16:56,42 --> 00:16:57,56
and to get out my own as

173
00:16:57,56 --> 00:17:04,48
a welding consultant.
Which was very good and

174
00:17:07,85 --> 00:17:14,74
. Anyhow i left because the
firm that i was working

175
00:17:14,74 --> 00:17:18,57
for they belong. You know interstate
and all that which i didn't want to go

176
00:17:22,22 --> 00:17:29,16
. Anyhow after that i went to
the foreman for us. Must deal

177
00:17:29,16 --> 00:17:36,07
fabricating. And i left there in 1969

178
00:17:38,52 --> 00:17:41,31
and i thought well that's it. I've
got one and i work at him all

179
00:17:42,29 --> 00:17:47,90
a bit after about three months
and nearly drove me mad and got

180
00:17:47,91 --> 00:17:53,78
a job on the water board as you try
and clerical assistant the engineer

181
00:17:55,52 --> 00:17:58,23
and i left there in 1977 i worked for mr.

182
00:17:58,23 --> 00:18:04,48
Fischer. On the tension. You were

183
00:18:05,36 --> 00:18:08,58
like all boilermakers very
deaf and you. Yes i got

184
00:18:08,58 --> 00:18:13,97
a definite allowance. You know only a
couple of years ago and you just heard

185
00:18:13,97 --> 00:18:20,16
a number dollars. But if i
went there earlier you know i

186
00:18:20,86 --> 00:18:23,83
probably got more you also have

187
00:18:23,83 --> 00:18:28,61
a very gruff voice do you do you attribute
that to any particular thing as far as

188
00:18:28,61 --> 00:18:34,100
the all work is concerned i got a bloody
cold and i'm shiver in. It because it's

189
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,65
a lousy day. But i notice.
Ian ferrier also has

190
00:18:39,65 --> 00:18:43,48
a very very gruff voice not unlike yours
i was wanting to do with the dust or

191
00:18:43,48 --> 00:18:49,33
anything to do with welding for instance.
Well i don't know if you could be i've

192
00:18:49,33 --> 00:18:56,03
never analysed it. Yeah
yeah well the end was

193
00:18:56,03 --> 00:19:01,80
not so i don't know where that doesn't
leave us anywhere but to answer the back

194
00:19:01,80 --> 00:19:08,74
week as well it could be could be
anything so you know there was anything

195
00:19:08,74 --> 00:19:15,26
there. As far as looking
back working on the bridge.

196
00:19:17,72 --> 00:19:21,60
Why do you think now fifty
years later you well it was

197
00:19:21,60 --> 00:19:28,28
a an experience that i was pleased to go
through because after seeing some of the

198
00:19:28,28 --> 00:19:32,61
people that i suppose that live
there because working today. It's

199
00:19:32,69 --> 00:19:38,89
a bloody disgrace you think the bridge was
very well built. Oh yes yes. You know

200
00:19:38,89 --> 00:19:44,53
doubt about it. It was.
You know the inspection

201
00:19:45,94 --> 00:19:52,28
and the actual and it design of it.
Well everything had to be perfect.

202
00:19:53,14 --> 00:19:54,68
And i don't my right that

203
00:19:54,68 --> 00:19:59,98
a big perfect. What do you think about the
proposals to put more lanes on the beach

204
00:19:59,98 --> 00:20:04,12
now. Well i think the fact
that of safety that it was

205
00:20:04,12 --> 00:20:10,75
a build and it could easily taken because

206
00:20:12,71 --> 00:20:17,23
. The fact of the safety that
that was built under it was

207
00:20:17,95 --> 00:20:24,28
a greatly reduced. Now. Because i think

208
00:20:24,28 --> 00:20:31,12
engineering today and it's
got it worked out that. As

209
00:20:31,12 --> 00:20:37,87
i know you what can be done. I want
can't be done so with all ridges though

210
00:20:37,87 --> 00:20:42,62
i know the one in melbourne. It will have

211
00:20:42,62 --> 00:20:49,19
a bit of bad luck. So what about the idea
of putting extra lines on do you think it

212
00:20:49,19 --> 00:20:55,22
could be done or should be done. Well you
know these days. I don't go over that.

213
00:20:56,74 --> 00:21:02,91
A bit as i've got to do something. Haven't
they. I think they should build another

214
00:21:02,91 --> 00:21:08,40
bridge. Because they sit and read the blood
do you think. And i mean other fifty

215
00:21:08,40 --> 00:21:13,28
years before they even start it. You
worked on the doctor that you do you think

216
00:21:13,28 --> 00:21:20,28
they could build another tunnel.
Yes well i know the god i

217
00:21:20,98 --> 00:21:27,71
am in other parts of the world. I know the
time that it's going to take to do it

218
00:21:27,71 --> 00:21:33,48
in control of that time that you would
have done i know as well. It's just out of

219
00:21:33,48 --> 00:21:40,27
the question do you remember many people
who worked on the bridge other other

220
00:21:40,27 --> 00:21:45,21
people. Oh well

221
00:21:48,44 --> 00:21:54,66
it's hard to say it have to see their
head. And yet have to know their name and

222
00:21:54,66 --> 00:22:00,73
they have to bring something up that
you know. You knew that happened

223
00:22:02,08 --> 00:22:03,97
. But it is

224
00:22:03,97 --> 00:22:08,08
a view as to give me names or if i want to
see somebody in the street. Now i know i

225
00:22:08,08 --> 00:22:14,70
mean fairs and other senior charlie
venice journalists but i could walk past

226
00:22:14,70 --> 00:22:20,14
people that i didn't know. That

227
00:22:20,15 --> 00:22:24,54
a bureau wouldn't recognize it.
Well thank you very much mr.

228
00:22:24,54 --> 00:22:28,38
Root spin could have usa to give
me the time. Thanks guys for that.
