1
00:00:01,77 --> 00:00:16,26
That's why you were brought here right right right right right.

2
00:00:18,49 --> 00:01:28,94
Yeah because really writing about it was never on everybody like everybody pretty you know you remember that

3
00:01:38,14 --> 00:02:26,83
and with Troy. I'm going to stay here and you will let me love that way for me like right before I went. Yeah yeah.

4
00:02:26,87 --> 00:03:09,91
And then there was something about me I was really really cool across for a young guy like sixteen

5
00:03:09,91 --> 00:03:16,92
and the Cross doesn't really know me.

6
00:03:17,02 --> 00:03:50,12
There's a way to go with a friend like this description right on right now he's clearly got it right right.

7
00:04:07,6 --> 00:05:56,39
No You know why can't they race right. You will not get one on one with you Jack.

8
00:06:03,85 --> 00:06:27,02
You know life is not my right you feel if people can you actually can be said has actually formed you know that you

9
00:06:27,02 --> 00:06:30,5
know that that was a group of about ten

10
00:06:30,5 --> 00:06:55,55
or so people who knew what I was going to church all about why that was what I was up to do well here I started telling

11
00:06:57,27 --> 00:07:05,45
people what life was like can you get here.

12
00:07:05,49 --> 00:07:33,9
That was like ninety seven days to be the first strike me to be the first actual drug part of the way they run like a

13
00:07:33,9 --> 00:07:44,84
holiday that you can go up to maybe hour to the bailout little meeting over there you know that really sort of public

14
00:07:44,84 --> 00:07:58,15
meeting was was the only right one. The one that you would hire him.

15
00:08:05,38 --> 00:08:15,39
Every ounce of gold and everybody know what we do have a way to look back and nothing's ever happened.

16
00:08:15,41 --> 00:08:25,04
Live on a day when you're with your girl sitting up in bed

17
00:08:25,04 --> 00:08:51,11
when I have respect for me that I can do this I really did it was a lot of the first hard drive got to be a life.

18
00:08:51,18 --> 00:09:07,92
I mean I saw down the street a very first thought was oh I thought yeah well that's what they do.

19
00:09:07,92 --> 00:09:36,45
That's why should we wish to get away with it. Try doing that in life will be a record for the right.

20
00:09:36,46 --> 00:09:48,08
Can't treat yourself like that in the middle three that trying to block a young street arrangement that you.

21
00:09:48,11 --> 00:09:58,99
This is the life. Are you going. This is the language you write that will be wrong. Yet you got it right.

22
00:09:59,06 --> 00:13:49,25
It was a stick. OK while free trade. Thanks very much to you. That's right that's right.

23
00:14:02,81 --> 00:17:24,54
YES YOU DO You are right I mean you were all right. You got it right and you're. I mean you guys.

24
00:18:01,3 --> 00:19:04,43
Really you guys really Carol. It's your five year old boy I love you love you.

25
00:19:05,1 --> 00:20:01,28
Everybody others really don't follow the leader like you do why give a shit what you think it's a good.

26
00:20:16,92 --> 00:21:07,98
So you say you know you know. Well right there was a day we told you it was very much.

27
00:21:10,22 --> 00:21:58,94
I don't think it was probably my college. There is actually some guy actually the other one.

28
00:22:01,35 --> 00:23:00,41
But there are very really there is no McQuarrie you really do the country because everybody would want to talk to God I

29
00:23:00,41 --> 00:23:15,29
mean if you believe it was all right. But it was a very gradually over the years.

30
00:23:15,29 --> 00:24:01,13
If you try to get your funny bone right with my refund on the street clothes on.

31
00:24:07,43 --> 00:25:55,52
Everything you could you can be like you know you know that you have really you know she was talking with you.

32
00:26:05,22 --> 00:27:38,88
A very beautiful very carefully because competition.

33
00:28:01,57 --> 00:28:11,73
The army just once they tried to take her down there was this thing.

34
00:28:11,92 --> 00:29:21,14
That's what did you tell us that the price of one hundred dollars on the bridge was being raised by my full

35
00:29:21,17 --> 00:29:26,75
and she doesn't very funny. Yet she made a movie in the States recently called pretty bright.

36
00:29:30,68 --> 00:29:37,73
This was this was a working abroad she raises five.

37
00:29:37,87 --> 00:29:55,3
They all up and you saw here was a case that she was just kind of in the room that was sitting right next to him

38
00:29:55,3 --> 00:30:19,65
and she was a dedicated I love. What's on it now. Thank you very much going to a place on the menu here.

39
00:30:19,9 --> 00:30:37,03
There was a guy who was very much. The guy was really really nice.

40
00:30:37,16 --> 00:31:03,61
She was like you know your wife doesn't really go some of the things you want you want to do you really want to do you

41
00:31:03,61 --> 00:31:19,23
can actually chicken little towns castle with your plate plate going down toward the rock why there's the Crown Street

42
00:31:19,23 --> 00:31:19,63
on your right.

43
00:31:19,78 --> 00:31:25,75
You go down there but for the road was a little just right there on the first corner

44
00:31:25,75 --> 00:31:35,69
but it was the place where the right. Yeah gallery just all my thoughts exactly about the role.

45
00:31:35,81 --> 00:31:42,96
It was a few little shops. Coffee County of the mine it's a Turkish coffee shop.

46
00:31:42,98 --> 00:31:53,99
Previous to that was to go through my takeaway for thirty something for about three months the product was a very good

47
00:31:53,99 --> 00:32:12,42
thing that it's about two years. Hear hear. Right but it's in the same block as the list that wasn't true.

48
00:32:12,9 --> 00:32:19,03
It was and it was usually something like I mean once again it was when I came here.

49
00:32:19,99 --> 00:32:30,06
I mean during the week possibly it was restored but you know I used to go on about yourself all your heroes.

50
00:32:31,01 --> 00:32:46,00
You know like they're seeing some of the guidance at the time because if you look at this terrible angle of forty five

51
00:32:46,00 --> 00:32:46,42
degree.

52
00:32:47,43 --> 00:33:08,07
You can't use the very same day you brought up in the family that he would still like instructing things

53
00:33:10,09 --> 00:33:19,31
and collectively warned about certain places and I knew you. Very well.

54
00:33:19,54 --> 00:33:51,8
Where sky cool people will want me in the sun and things but I thought he was getting back

55
00:33:51,8 --> 00:33:58,11
and he decided we should stop drinking.

56
00:34:03,67 --> 00:34:15,35
It was the guy who sounded like launching into sort of like a Harley that was my river which I thought that was a big

57
00:34:15,35 --> 00:34:19,98
name your particular Somebody had mentioned here.

58
00:34:21,49 --> 00:34:30,63
I'm sure it was from the bridge once he'd gone back a couple weeks later I thought what I was seven my father loves me.

59
00:34:31,13 --> 00:34:35,45
I mean they really did tell me where you're getting the Dewey.

60
00:34:36,11 --> 00:34:43,58
But there was no problem with the sixty's was no problem about finding out where the casing was simply because they

61
00:34:43,58 --> 00:34:56,24
needed a steamroller that people would talk about the you know all about where the parts of it was he didn't have to

62
00:34:56,24 --> 00:34:56,54
say.

63
00:34:57,13 --> 00:35:01,93
The last thing he has to do is that he got this

64
00:35:01,93 --> 00:35:23,38
or he didn't say just what the place for this in the context of the sausage must go looking to get likes to see anybody

65
00:35:23,85 --> 00:35:32,49
but I along with the early settlers of the early sixty's here because he knew that there was a sort of that I mean

66
00:35:32,49 --> 00:35:54,21
you're talking about major gets to one but I don't really see it because at that time with the place.

67
00:35:54,98 --> 00:36:01,28
It was actually just right there for a young player actually when you.

68
00:36:04,17 --> 00:36:27,58
Yes I mean you know you know you guys hear what was yours because people like you

69
00:36:31,64 --> 00:37:31,79
and you're writing a polite about the three The Real Story tonight with the role of the role of a really really really

70
00:37:33,29 --> 00:38:07,46
really very mean if you like and you can tell. Well you know. You know with this.

71
00:38:08,63 --> 00:38:17,98
Yes yes yes yes Miles get it could be not acceptable.

72
00:38:19,15 --> 00:38:52,25
Again not easily create a place that is psychiatric and she actually was actually more than just sorry.

73
00:38:52,4 --> 00:39:23,69
A child she held you know this oppression. You can pretty much get it I mean you need to when you're under a bond.

74
00:39:26,13 --> 00:39:40,93
You know what they saw that I mean that I wasn't getting this is what my sixteen

75
00:39:46,22 --> 00:41:58,93
and let go because that was a tepid existed. Let me have it and if you're a True. So ready to roll with me.

76
00:42:02,54 --> 00:42:41,79
But they never do anything. Let me get yourself a conceptual get me to the city to get one.

77
00:42:49,74 --> 00:44:00,22
They are going to take one of the state of the city from quite specific things I could never think to much Mike.

78
00:44:06,49 --> 00:44:09,5
You develop and therefore when they do specify.

79
00:44:09,54 --> 00:45:31,62
I mean for a long time they haven't necessarily the concept of what they're really like you really want to get there

80
00:45:43,15 --> 00:45:58,22
yet again and this is a good place for you three.

81
00:46:06,86 --> 00:48:00,89
Yes let's play because that's crazy like probably not really the way to get there is a problem with you anyway.

82
00:48:01,76 --> 00:48:32,18
Thank you again this was just like somebody calling as far as right here but it's very slow coming in and

83
00:48:32,18 --> 00:48:59,88
when the call yesterday was because he was just had a very you know just if you will

84
00:48:59,88 --> 00:49:05,25
when they say oh we don't like this but if you bring up one.

85
00:49:05,39 --> 00:49:11,9
We love to have a call because I mean so much of this is a lot of people don't like the going to be done immediately

86
00:49:11,9 --> 00:49:29,76
once we've got the type of the type you would really shine if this stuff was recorded so someone somewhere might want

87
00:49:29,76 --> 00:49:43,65
to do something on the stuff like a colleague of yours.

88
00:49:48,46 --> 00:51:45,81
In all the different to different people that you believe there will be. This is.

89
00:52:07,24 --> 00:52:36,08
I don't see many friends just promising that your life you know what you know that she will actually that was because

90
00:52:36,62 --> 00:53:08,00
she was she like you might write a book very patient a little bit like that.

91
00:53:15,74 --> 00:53:33,42
She was the one trying to push for it to you

92
00:53:33,42 --> 00:56:00,00
and you actually you know what you did you hear Jack you know you enlightened the Myles Brand new baby. Very.

93
00:56:03,35 --> 00:57:31,58
Really you just you're here very very because she said and you do you know Michael history will back up.

94
00:57:32,2 --> 00:57:56,11
You just try to look just to give an example the last one very well the second the one with the right call.

95
00:58:02,32 --> 00:58:10,49
I mean obviously none of the characters you guys have that you know me like I mean you don't get what you call a sex

96
00:58:10,49 --> 00:58:23,62
life because obviously the guy thought it all about the money in the phone right.

97
00:58:25,07 --> 00:58:48,61
All right well here in the remarkable number of really well somebody you know somebody is measuring what I think there

98
00:58:48,61 --> 00:59:11,82
are chapters think some of the details are two chapters in that little really really backed up there are other things

99
00:59:13,26 --> 00:59:17,00
like the way you have to come across.

100
00:59:18,85 --> 00:59:24,56
Just the way you live your life and someone who has read a lot about you know all the strike literature

101
00:59:24,56 --> 00:59:37,97
and my you know people in the twenty's and you know when you read this book and I say this one of the cross.

102
00:59:38,54 --> 00:59:47,51
I mean our neighborhood before Mark was just really got to on this guy John Riley who died ten years ago was that all

103
00:59:47,72 --> 00:59:47,91
right.

104
00:59:48,98 --> 00:59:57,42
That's what the crux of something is always this book was actually it was probably the best source for scraps of welly

105
00:59:57,93 --> 01:02:08,77
mine was killed. Thank you. Love life. Can you see it the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

106
01:02:13,06 --> 01:02:26,35
Yes I really aggressively was there and the funny thing is that playing music was.

107
01:02:33,11 --> 01:02:36,18
Well it did really well for you what.
