1
00:00:19,37 --> 00:00:21,37
Those.

2
00:00:22,40 --> 00:00:26,47
Oh those.

3
00:00:26,49 --> 00:00:29,43
Jobs.

4
00:00:30,40 --> 00:00:35,94
Those sorry you are. Right.

5
00:00:36,40 --> 00:00:40,05
Like money on their minds.

6
00:00:40,10 --> 00:00:42,63
Joshua martin and i first came to nimbin

7
00:00:42,63 --> 00:00:46,13
when i was about two years old i came
out with my parents from england

8
00:00:46,83 --> 00:00:51,05
and we were often western australia and
travelled right the way across the country.

9
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:55,10
My parents were basically searching for
an alternative lifestyle to what they'd

10
00:00:55,10 --> 00:01:00,42
experienced when they were my age
in wind and they ended up in nimbin

11
00:01:00,42 --> 00:01:04,19
and they were sort of directed
out to the commune there

12
00:01:04,19 --> 00:01:08,17
and we ended up staying in
the area for about 10 years.

13
00:01:08,19 --> 00:01:09,50
What do you know these memories

14
00:01:09,50 --> 00:01:14,00
and well the only thing i
remember was intolerable falls

15
00:01:14,00 --> 00:01:16,42
when we were living in this kind of.

16
00:01:16,44 --> 00:01:19,74
Well i suppose you could call it a house
it was a wooden platform with a big old

17
00:01:19,74 --> 00:01:22,84
army tent and as sort of like
construction over the top of it

18
00:01:22,84 --> 00:01:26,86
and struggling to get it built in the
wet season and with you know ticks

19
00:01:26,86 --> 00:01:28,09
and rain and all the rest of it

20
00:01:28,09 --> 00:01:32,53
and i just remember having complete
freedom to sort of swim in the creek

21
00:01:32,53 --> 00:01:33,50
and run around there

22
00:01:33,50 --> 00:01:37,59
and you know there are a lot of other
young kids my age sort of just.

23
00:01:37,79 --> 00:01:41,42
Learning to adventure around the
whole place and it was fantastic.

24
00:01:41,83 --> 00:01:46,96
I just remember running around
you know in the sun. Annabelle.

25
00:01:46,98 --> 00:01:53,42
Nothing about your child.
Well you know. I suppose.

26
00:01:53,44 --> 00:01:58,53
I would i would have swapped a little bit
of the the actual security of knowing

27
00:01:58,53 --> 00:02:01,88
that you have a completely. You're home.

28
00:02:01,90 --> 00:02:05,31
Like because we did move around quite
a bit and a lot of the dwellings

29
00:02:05,31 --> 00:02:08,67
that we were living in were pretty
kind of makeshift from time to time

30
00:02:08,67 --> 00:02:11,61
but then again you know there
are a lot of sort of advantages

31
00:02:11,61 --> 00:02:14,34
that come along with that as well
because you know i always felt

32
00:02:14,34 --> 00:02:16,30
that i was part of a larger
community and stuff like that

33
00:02:16,30 --> 00:02:18,01
and i definitely wouldn't
have stopped any of that.

34
00:02:20,94 --> 00:02:23,85
Have you.

35
00:02:24,85 --> 00:02:29,72
You know how did you realize
you know. Well it was.

36
00:02:31,10 --> 00:02:34,98
I suppose i felt like i was part of a larger
community because we were also sort of

37
00:02:34,98 --> 00:02:38,91
involved in the same things like my
family and all of the other families

38
00:02:38,91 --> 00:02:42,05
and people there were all sort
of hand building their houses

39
00:02:42,05 --> 00:02:45,86
and all facing the problems of all you
know of food and community living

40
00:02:45,86 --> 00:02:47,20
and stuff like that together

41
00:02:47,20 --> 00:02:51,49
and so i saw adults interacting in a
different way to what you see them in

42
00:02:51,49 --> 00:02:55,55
mainstream society and that was
reflected in the children as well

43
00:02:55,55 --> 00:02:59,02
that we sort of stayed together
as a larger group a lot more

44
00:02:59,92 --> 00:03:05,67
and sort of did a lot more of our sort
of daily activities together and.

45
00:03:05,69 --> 00:03:08,53
I suppose my experience
of it was jest as feeling

46
00:03:08,53 --> 00:03:11,54
that all of the adults around
me were a part of my family and

47
00:03:11,55 --> 00:03:12,98
that you know even faces

48
00:03:12,98 --> 00:03:15,84
that i only just recognized i knew
i could trust because of the way

49
00:03:15,84 --> 00:03:18,76
that i'd seen them living around me
and the same with all the children

50
00:03:18,76 --> 00:03:21,06
and i found it very easy to meet

51
00:03:21,06 --> 00:03:23,06
and play with a lot of different
children because i knew

52
00:03:23,06 --> 00:03:27,43
that we were all just part of
this sort of big farm together.

53
00:03:27,45 --> 00:03:33,06
So what about education. Well.

54
00:03:33,08 --> 00:03:37,65
Well major case nimbin was interesting
because i spent some time in the alternative

55
00:03:37,65 --> 00:03:38,37
schools there

56
00:03:38,37 --> 00:03:42,75
but then i also spent most of my primary
school years at the straight school as it

57
00:03:42,75 --> 00:03:46,89
was called which was like the nimbin
central school and it was at a time

58
00:03:46,89 --> 00:03:49,53
when children from the
alternative families

59
00:03:49,53 --> 00:03:54,14
and the hippy settlers around the place
were starting to go to the sort of central

60
00:03:54,14 --> 00:03:57,65
school and they were starting to actually
be interaction between the hippy kids

61
00:03:57,65 --> 00:03:59,20
and the straight kids and.

62
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,73
Can imagine it was quite a
kind of intense sort of thing

63
00:04:02,73 --> 00:04:05,97
that was going on within the classrooms
because there's a lot of contention between

64
00:04:05,97 --> 00:04:09,85
them which i suppose i just a reflection
of the tension in the whole community

65
00:04:09,85 --> 00:04:14,48
but that tension between
us sort of dissipated

66
00:04:14,48 --> 00:04:17,84
and we actually got our act together over
the years that i was in primary school

67
00:04:17,84 --> 00:04:22,14
and it was a really interesting thing because
i remember at like you know in years.

68
00:04:22,14 --> 00:04:25,25
One and two and three feeling
very sort of threatened

69
00:04:25,25 --> 00:04:30,05
and intimidated by the straight
kids and very separate from them

70
00:04:30,05 --> 00:04:31,82
and then over the years.

71
00:04:31,90 --> 00:04:34,65
Actually everything became a lot
more relaxed and a lot more positive

72
00:04:34,65 --> 00:04:36,18
and by the end of

73
00:04:36,18 --> 00:04:38,88
that time there was actually a real
lot of positive stuff happening

74
00:04:39,94 --> 00:04:42,42
and it was funny because
i didn't see as much of

75
00:04:42,42 --> 00:04:44,21
that in the adult community as i did.

76
00:04:44,32 --> 00:04:47,53
Among the kids and so you
know it was i suppose

77
00:04:47,53 --> 00:04:52,19
that was a kind of a special thing that was
going on. When i've lived in position.

78
00:04:54,21 --> 00:05:00,27
What was it about. What we
hear is the difference. Well.

79
00:05:01,53 --> 00:05:03,89
All of the straight kids felt as though.

80
00:05:03,91 --> 00:05:07,91
The hippy children in their
school were sort of dirty

81
00:05:07,91 --> 00:05:12,21
and weren't as sort of refined as them

82
00:05:12,21 --> 00:05:16,78
and didn't have a christian upbringing
was a very important part of it and.

83
00:05:17,49 --> 00:05:20,97
Also kind of felt that their
parents and that they as well.

84
00:05:21,11 --> 00:05:24,05
Were an intrusion into the kind
of routine and the pattern

85
00:05:24,05 --> 00:05:25,06
that have been set up in that area

86
00:05:25,79 --> 00:05:29,07
and i suppose in a way that's rightly so
because we were playing in what used to be

87
00:05:29,07 --> 00:05:33,90
their playgrounds and their older brother's
playgrounds and stuff like that but.

88
00:05:33,92 --> 00:05:36,37
I suppose as the years
went by and they realized

89
00:05:36,37 --> 00:05:39,07
that we could be just as much
fun and just as creative

90
00:05:39,07 --> 00:05:42,02
and just as kind of into sport
and into all of those things

91
00:05:42,02 --> 00:05:44,74
that they were into all of
that started to break away

92
00:05:45,48 --> 00:05:47,72
and i member sort of in
my ear in particular.

93
00:05:48,17 --> 00:05:50,79
Every time we all went on an
excursion together or did something

94
00:05:50,79 --> 00:05:53,82
that brought us together all of
that stuff started to break down

95
00:05:53,82 --> 00:05:59,23
and i suppose you know it did break down a
lot faster among us than i did among the

96
00:05:59,23 --> 00:06:01,44
adults. And you know we would have parties

97
00:06:01,44 --> 00:06:05,27
and i remember having parties myself
where straight kids would come over

98
00:06:05,27 --> 00:06:08,18
and they would look different and speak
differently and all that kind of stuff

99
00:06:08,88 --> 00:06:11,08
and they would kind of
tentatively walk into our house

100
00:06:11,08 --> 00:06:13,82
and see all of the sort of hippy ornaments
and stuff like that around the place

101
00:06:13,82 --> 00:06:17,58
and just be absolutely fascinated that
they were allowed to go inside that

102
00:06:17,58 --> 00:06:20,67
when their parents were so hesitant
about having anything to do with

103
00:06:20,67 --> 00:06:21,57
that part of the community

104
00:06:21,57 --> 00:06:25,13
and you know they were actually
quite proud of themselves

105
00:06:25,94 --> 00:06:27,25
that they were able to go

106
00:06:27,25 --> 00:06:30,86
and you know participate with us until
let us into their lives as well.

107
00:06:32,25 --> 00:06:34,56
Because you know it was something that
their parents just weren't able to do

108
00:06:34,56 --> 00:06:37,27
and i mean i go to meetings
now and i'm 19 years old

109
00:06:37,27 --> 00:06:40,28
and i see all of the faces
of those kids parents

110
00:06:41,01 --> 00:06:42,87
and it's still just a wall
of resistance you know

111
00:06:42,87 --> 00:06:44,67
and i remember sort of 10 years ago.

112
00:06:44,89 --> 00:06:48,37
Breaking through that wall with all those
kids and having a great time with them

113
00:06:48,37 --> 00:06:51,54
but now you know it's just there
are some things in that community

114
00:06:52,53 --> 00:06:56,51
that will never change. You know.

115
00:06:59,19 --> 00:07:01,68
You know. Life is.

116
00:07:02,78 --> 00:07:08,51
Whose owners.

117
00:07:10,90 --> 00:07:14,36
I suppose. Among the adults
the thing that i remember is.

118
00:07:14,38 --> 00:07:19,88
Walking up see we lived in a house just
behind a craft gallery in town there for

119
00:07:19,88 --> 00:07:22,01
quite a long time we had
that house for 10 years

120
00:07:22,88 --> 00:07:27,61
and i remember walking up at nighttime
and just seeing the kind of things

121
00:07:27,61 --> 00:07:30,39
that were going on in the streets
there and a lot of them.

122
00:07:30,41 --> 00:07:30,95
I didn't really understand

123
00:07:30,95 --> 00:07:34,81
but i could actually see the
mechanism between the straits

124
00:07:34,81 --> 00:07:35,88
and the hippies outwork

125
00:07:35,88 --> 00:07:40,97
and you know i would see a bunch of really
aggressive kind of you know people run

126
00:07:40,97 --> 00:07:44,15
across from the rainbow cafe and
punch in the windows of the pub

127
00:07:45,00 --> 00:07:45,47
and then run away

128
00:07:46,20 --> 00:07:49,19
and all the strays would come running out
of the pub you know around closing time

129
00:07:49,19 --> 00:07:52,44
and fight with these people in the
street and i saw that happening a lot

130
00:07:53,23 --> 00:07:57,73
and you know it was a kind of two sides
of the street type of thing going on for

131
00:07:57,73 --> 00:07:59,43
quite a while and i just remember.

132
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,61
You know hearing a lot of
complaints about the way

133
00:08:03,61 --> 00:08:07,02
that the straits lived in the town
from from the alternative people

134
00:08:07,02 --> 00:08:09,76
that the noise from the pub and the
alcohol and all that kind of stuff

135
00:08:09,76 --> 00:08:14,65
and you know those kind of criticisms were
just as strong as the criticisms from

136
00:08:14,65 --> 00:08:18,13
straight people about you know smoking
grass in the street and stuff like

137
00:08:18,13 --> 00:08:21,45
that as well. And so i suppose you
know you ask me about criticisms

138
00:08:21,45 --> 00:08:24,49
and straightaway i'm talking about the drug
issue there as you know it seems to be

139
00:08:24,49 --> 00:08:31,45
where everything leads to doesn't.
So. Well yeah absolutely.

140
00:08:31,98 --> 00:08:33,83
Because you know.

141
00:08:33,84 --> 00:08:40,83
When i came around there was a lot of
hypocrisy in in terms of those two sides

142
00:08:40,83 --> 00:08:44,70
of the community criticising each other
because you've got all of you know all of

143
00:08:44,70 --> 00:08:47,97
these straights in town at night
getting really really drunk in the pub

144
00:08:47,97 --> 00:08:50,95
and playing a lot of really loud music
and getting aggressive and violent

145
00:08:50,95 --> 00:08:53,57
and tearing up and down in their
cars and light type of thing

146
00:08:53,57 --> 00:08:55,96
and then their wives

147
00:08:55,96 --> 00:09:00,43
and their families a criticising the
alternative community for smoking drugs in the

148
00:09:00,43 --> 00:09:03,64
street and for that disrupting their
community and yet the community

149
00:09:03,64 --> 00:09:07,09
that they were talking about you know it
had a very sort of destructive face to it

150
00:09:07,09 --> 00:09:10,03
as well and i member. You know
on the straight kids farms.

151
00:09:10,20 --> 00:09:13,25
There was you know a lot of kind
of guns and a lot of violence

152
00:09:13,25 --> 00:09:16,59
and a lot of sort of stories about
domestic violence and stuff like that

153
00:09:16,59 --> 00:09:19,32
and it was all very scary
to me just the same way

154
00:09:19,32 --> 00:09:23,23
that among those straight families you know
the whole idea of kind of smoking dope

155
00:09:23,23 --> 00:09:24,31
in your family and

156
00:09:24,31 --> 00:09:28,66
and sort of you know people hanging around
naked on your community must have been

157
00:09:28,66 --> 00:09:32,97
very scary to them. So what was that.

158
00:09:34,07 --> 00:09:37,78
You know she was you know.

159
00:09:37,80 --> 00:09:43,03
What was i mean i think about your life.

160
00:09:44,31 --> 00:09:49,43
Well the whole thing about relating to other
adults in a similar way to how you do

161
00:09:49,43 --> 00:09:54,16
with your parents and you know sort
of feeling that that feeling of trust

162
00:09:54,16 --> 00:09:56,72
and feeling comfortable around
a whole community of people

163
00:09:57,44 --> 00:09:59,76
and spending a lot of time you
know in sort of families that.

164
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,93
Asians are other people's
places and stuff like that

165
00:10:01,93 --> 00:10:07,70
and also feeling as though not just your
house is the safest place in the world

166
00:10:07,70 --> 00:10:09,78
but like the whole community
is somewhere where you belong

167
00:10:09,78 --> 00:10:13,21
and you know you can kind of wonder
among all those different people

168
00:10:13,21 --> 00:10:15,78
and still feel at home. And i think

169
00:10:15,78 --> 00:10:19,48
that was the main thing because i noticed
you know among the straight kids

170
00:10:19,48 --> 00:10:22,90
that they had a very kind of territorial
thing about their mum and their dad

171
00:10:22,90 --> 00:10:28,36
and their family and i sort of just
really never felt there. And i was.

172
00:10:29,86 --> 00:10:32,57
Of course. Yeah absolutely.

173
00:10:32,99 --> 00:10:37,02
Because i mean you know my parents still
played just as powerful a role in my life

174
00:10:37,02 --> 00:10:41,12
as this is there was also this whole
sort of added security of knowing that

175
00:10:41,12 --> 00:10:46,05
that you know you were a part of this kind
of meaningful thing going on all around

176
00:10:46,05 --> 00:10:50,36
you and all of those people celebrated
together and work together and all

177
00:10:50,36 --> 00:10:52,88
that kind of stuff and you know.

178
00:10:52,90 --> 00:10:54,81
Just that that feeling of assurance was

179
00:10:54,81 --> 00:11:04,57
that was what i felt surrounded
by my whole childhood.

180
00:11:05,39 --> 00:11:11,32
I think you know from. You know. You know.

181
00:11:11,34 --> 00:11:16,53
You know they're looking to that
you know how do you know the rest.

182
00:11:17,49 --> 00:11:23,45
Yeah. I think i learnt a lot about being
open minded to people's points of view

183
00:11:23,45 --> 00:11:26,98
and being acceptant of people's
limitations and stuff like that

184
00:11:27,69 --> 00:11:31,56
and i think i learnt about
sort of listening to people

185
00:11:31,56 --> 00:11:36,62
and being compassionate to people's kind
of predicament or the people situation

186
00:11:36,62 --> 00:11:42,03
and so rather than always having a kind
of you know a motivated sort of point of

187
00:11:42,03 --> 00:11:43,77
view about things where
you've got something to prove

188
00:11:43,77 --> 00:11:48,02
or you've made a decision how you feel about
things to actually sort of let things

189
00:11:48,02 --> 00:11:51,66
flow a bit more and to to see
situations change and come and go

190
00:11:51,66 --> 00:11:54,73
and be a bit more accepting of that
kind of thing and i don't know.

191
00:11:54,75 --> 00:11:58,75
You know how much it's actually rubbed off
say politically or anything like that

192
00:11:58,75 --> 00:12:03,18
but i would say that. You know just
in terms of kind of social situations

193
00:12:03,18 --> 00:12:08,64
and stuff like that. I think a little
bit more easygoing about you know about

194
00:12:08,65 --> 00:12:10,76
that type of thing. It's
hard to actually explain.

195
00:12:11,11 --> 00:12:11,78
You know the way

196
00:12:11,78 --> 00:12:16,07
that those values affect your behaviour
now because you know it's pretty much

197
00:12:16,07 --> 00:12:16,99
invisible to me

198
00:12:16,99 --> 00:12:21,19
and i don't feel i don't feel different to
all of the you know people in mainstream

199
00:12:21,19 --> 00:12:22,75
society that i'm relating to now

200
00:12:22,75 --> 00:12:27,50
but sometimes i feel as though i'm a little
bit ready more ready to be open minded

201
00:12:27,50 --> 00:12:31,08
into graft situations for what they are
than people who have got a whole load of

202
00:12:31,08 --> 00:12:32,54
kind of preconceived ideas

203
00:12:32,54 --> 00:12:37,54
that they've been taught in a very linear
way from their family and their parents.

204
00:12:37,56 --> 00:12:45,74
They were so.

205
00:12:46,99 --> 00:12:51,19
No they weren't the only the only
sort of frightening situations

206
00:12:51,19 --> 00:12:55,09
that i can remember were sort
of up in town late at night

207
00:12:55,09 --> 00:12:58,93
when you know there was sort
of violence going on around me

208
00:12:58,93 --> 00:13:02,37
and i felt really kind of afraid and loan

209
00:13:02,37 --> 00:13:05,70
and i remember sometimes sort
of out at the bush holes

210
00:13:05,70 --> 00:13:08,26
when they'd have big
dances and bands out there

211
00:13:08,26 --> 00:13:11,69
and sometimes those kind
of situations we get ugly

212
00:13:11,69 --> 00:13:15,68
and i would suddenly feel completely
alienated from the whole thing and

213
00:13:15,68 --> 00:13:20,24
that could be very frightening
sometimes and i suppose.

214
00:13:20,26 --> 00:13:25,22
Like living there has also been conducive
to me kind of you know trying different

215
00:13:25,22 --> 00:13:29,96
drugs and stuff like that
which you know i probably.

216
00:13:29,97 --> 00:13:32,63
It's not that i regret doing
assess that i realize now

217
00:13:32,63 --> 00:13:35,63
that there's actually you know
no need to go as far into

218
00:13:35,63 --> 00:13:36,69
that as a lot of people do.

219
00:13:37,62 --> 00:13:40,81
And so i suppose you know i didn't
i didn't need that kind of thing

220
00:13:40,81 --> 00:13:43,80
but then there are a lot of other people
who have those kind of you know who have

221
00:13:43,80 --> 00:13:44,74
other reference points.

222
00:13:45,57 --> 00:13:48,60
You know forced upon them as well like
you know all those people who get into

223
00:13:48,60 --> 00:13:49,68
driving fast cars around

224
00:13:49,68 --> 00:13:52,18
and most people who get into
just hanging out at the beach

225
00:13:52,18 --> 00:13:55,17
and doing nothing else you know assess
the thing that young people do together

226
00:13:55,92 --> 00:13:57,77
and it doesn't in the end it
doesn't matter whether it's one

227
00:13:57,77 --> 00:14:03,05
or the other you know so you know. Don't
think there were any downsides at all.

228
00:14:03,83 --> 00:14:09,59
Were you friends you grew
up with. The russians so.

229
00:14:09,61 --> 00:14:14,75
For you. I suppose.

230
00:14:14,77 --> 00:14:17,22
That makes your original question
a little bit more clear.

231
00:14:19,87 --> 00:14:23,38
For me there were less
downsizing growing up in

232
00:14:23,38 --> 00:14:26,95
that community because we also maintained
a lot of ties with people outside

233
00:14:27,91 --> 00:14:29,79
and i was aware of the
value of a lot of things

234
00:14:29,79 --> 00:14:31,86
that were going on in mainstream
society and i was aware

235
00:14:31,86 --> 00:14:33,87
that i was going to participate.

236
00:14:33,88 --> 00:14:34,15
And

237
00:14:34,15 --> 00:14:38,23
that although i was growing up in this
nice kind of insular supportive community

238
00:14:39,16 --> 00:14:42,09
that i had a role to play in
mainstream society as well and

239
00:14:42,09 --> 00:14:43,79
that you know i needed to
be able to communicate

240
00:14:43,79 --> 00:14:48,07
and i needed to be able to be sort
of welfare scented and confident

241
00:14:48,07 --> 00:14:50,06
and straightforward and
all that type of thing.

242
00:14:50,07 --> 00:14:55,58
And so you know i managed to learn a bit
about open mindedness and letting go

243
00:14:55,58 --> 00:14:57,23
and stuff like that by living there.

244
00:14:57,31 --> 00:15:00,97
But then also keep it together
enough to go back and do something

245
00:15:00,97 --> 00:15:04,37
that i consider to be worthwhile. You
know participating with everyone.

246
00:15:04,59 --> 00:15:09,86
Whereas a lot of people who you know
grew up as hippies out there became very

247
00:15:09,86 --> 00:15:12,52
resentful about a lot of
things in mainstream society

248
00:15:13,33 --> 00:15:15,76
that made them very kind
of afraid to participate

249
00:15:15,76 --> 00:15:19,84
and so they became really kind of afraid
of the way that the government works

250
00:15:19,84 --> 00:15:23,07
and afraid of the way that the system
works and afraid of a lot of things

251
00:15:23,07 --> 00:15:27,74
that people do you know on a large scale
because you know they weren't used to all

252
00:15:27,74 --> 00:15:30,54
those mechanisms and they weren't open
minded to and they've been taught

253
00:15:30,54 --> 00:15:33,28
that all that was really bad and that's
why their parents ran away from it

254
00:15:34,52 --> 00:15:38,00
and so a lot of those people have
really you know fallen by the wayside

255
00:15:38,78 --> 00:15:43,10
and found very little to turn to
other than sort of you know drugs

256
00:15:43,10 --> 00:15:48,25
and kind of you know very kind of how would
you say close knit afraid little groups

257
00:15:48,25 --> 00:15:52,17
that they hide in. And you see a lot
of those people in the streets in them

258
00:15:52,17 --> 00:15:55,97
and you. You know.

259
00:15:55,99 --> 00:15:59,72
You know here was just a.

260
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,62
Yes yes. Well.

261
00:16:05,64 --> 00:16:09,25
It's you know a very important industry.

262
00:16:09,27 --> 00:16:14,03
There are sort of you know a lot of
people pushing heroin and stuff like

263
00:16:14,03 --> 00:16:17,95
that through this area who kind of
you know realize that it's a lot.

264
00:16:18,01 --> 00:16:21,22
It can be a lot more lucrative than working
just in sydney and stuff like that

265
00:16:21,22 --> 00:16:24,24
and they come up here with
intention of making a lot of money

266
00:16:24,24 --> 00:16:26,49
and often supporting her as well

267
00:16:27,27 --> 00:16:31,02
and you know it ties in perfectly
with the with the marijuana industry

268
00:16:31,02 --> 00:16:31,87
that exists here

269
00:16:32,64 --> 00:16:36,99
and you know all the people who do it you
know basically really bad greedy people

270
00:16:37,88 --> 00:16:41,28
and into people and you see it
going on all the time down there

271
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:43,19
and you know it's fine.

272
00:16:43,34 --> 00:16:46,89
It doesn't bother me at all
because you know the only people

273
00:16:46,89 --> 00:16:49,61
that they're enduring if people
that are gullible enough to go

274
00:16:49,61 --> 00:16:53,54
and pay a lot of money for marijuana and
so crying at themselves and you know.

275
00:16:53,60 --> 00:16:54,67
So it is one.

276
00:16:54,68 --> 00:16:56,79
It's just another one of those
industries just like fast food

277
00:16:57,54 --> 00:17:04,17
or you know cheap cars or whatever.
So you know more people.

278
00:17:04,73 --> 00:17:06,86
No it doesn't yet.

279
00:17:07,50 --> 00:17:11,49
As far as i'm concerned you know the
drug situation in the streets of nimbin

280
00:17:11,49 --> 00:17:12,89
doesn't actually need defending.

281
00:17:13,06 --> 00:17:16,05
Because the people who are
peddling the hard drugs.

282
00:17:16,19 --> 00:17:19,49
You know are just sort of
doing their own evil thing

283
00:17:19,49 --> 00:17:23,67
and you know anyone who chooses to participate.
You know enters at their own risk.

284
00:17:23,78 --> 00:17:27,74
And the people who are kind of falling
for and buying dope to support

285
00:17:27,74 --> 00:17:29,11
that whole sort of system.

286
00:17:29,19 --> 00:17:33,67
You know just kind of you know
following their own indulgent pursuits

287
00:17:33,67 --> 00:17:35,30
and that's fine if they
want to pay money for it

288
00:17:35,30 --> 00:17:36,31
and you know that's their problem

289
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:41,03
and i suppose the unfortunate thing about
it is kind of gullible people who come to

290
00:17:41,03 --> 00:17:44,26
him and they don't know what they're
looking for and they find grass

291
00:17:44,26 --> 00:17:47,42
and they get smashed and sit in the
main street you know looking dazed

292
00:17:47,42 --> 00:17:49,74
and confused and you just have to realize

293
00:17:49,74 --> 00:17:51,46
that those people have
fallen by the wayside.

294
00:17:51,72 --> 00:17:54,64
And if their choice to be
stationary and indolent

295
00:17:54,64 --> 00:17:58,04
and you know to not
participate in their society

296
00:17:58,04 --> 00:17:59,95
or not to take advantage of what they do.

297
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,41
When do and you know people
choose to do that in lots of ways

298
00:18:03,41 --> 00:18:07,75
and you know sitting around in nimbin
getting smashed is just as repetitive as

299
00:18:07,75 --> 00:18:09,18
working in a steel factory

300
00:18:09,18 --> 00:18:14,78
or you know doing anything else which
is kind of mind numbingly boring.

301
00:18:16,72 --> 00:18:21,59
What about. You talk about.

302
00:18:21,61 --> 00:18:27,57
You your friends your peers who
are now back in their own.

303
00:18:27,91 --> 00:18:30,71
You know i was both a story. I'm sure.

304
00:18:31,11 --> 00:18:35,99
Yeah well you know among people
who have grown up the way

305
00:18:35,99 --> 00:18:38,27
that i have they're living on
communes and stuff like that

306
00:18:38,27 --> 00:18:41,36
but still actually getting an
education and still realizing

307
00:18:41,36 --> 00:18:46,18
that you know there's a whole world of
things to do out there a lot of them like me

308
00:18:47,24 --> 00:18:50,19
you know have sort of been
down in sydney and i.

309
00:18:50,19 --> 00:18:51,43
Going back there and stuff like that

310
00:18:52,31 --> 00:18:57,72
but then there's another group of people
who have sort of stayed out there

311
00:18:57,72 --> 00:19:00,52
and actually made a success
out of living in the way

312
00:19:00,52 --> 00:19:03,58
that their parents have established and.

313
00:19:03,60 --> 00:19:06,86
I think that's a really really positive
thing because you know you can actually

314
00:19:06,86 --> 00:19:09,80
create a really good life for yourself
out there if you choose to do that

315
00:19:09,80 --> 00:19:13,90
and if you feel comfortable staying
in that area and so for example.

316
00:19:13,92 --> 00:19:18,37
It's funny it's mainly people who
are. You know i mean it's that again.

317
00:19:18,38 --> 00:19:21,61
Now you know i guess.

318
00:19:22,57 --> 00:19:24,90
And so among that group of people
who've grown up the way i have

319
00:19:24,90 --> 00:19:30,42
and i've chosen to stay out there and to
and to you know keep living in that area.

320
00:19:30,43 --> 00:19:33,20
A lot of them of kind of become
involved in alternative employment

321
00:19:33,20 --> 00:19:34,41
and self-employment

322
00:19:35,16 --> 00:19:39,88
and a few people come to mind like a musician
i know who you know could be just as

323
00:19:39,88 --> 00:19:42,51
successful playing in bands
in sydney or up here

324
00:19:42,51 --> 00:19:44,72
and chooses to keep living on the come in

325
00:19:44,72 --> 00:19:46,56
that his dad you know
was part of setting up

326
00:19:46,56 --> 00:19:51,79
and is now kind of you know recording
music out there and playing gigs in town

327
00:19:51,79 --> 00:19:54,80
and doing all all that kind of thing
and that really works for him

328
00:19:54,80 --> 00:19:59,30
and i think that's fantastic. And
i also know a girl my age who.

329
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,66
Sort of designs clothes and makes her own
clothes and sells markets around here

330
00:20:03,66 --> 00:20:08,86
and stuff like that and she's just
had a child up at the comment

331
00:20:08,86 --> 00:20:10,00
that i still live on paradise valley

332
00:20:10,71 --> 00:20:15,04
and you know has a really nice kind of
existence up there with her boyfriend in you

333
00:20:15,04 --> 00:20:17,47
know an old house and i know the
people that lived in that house before

334
00:20:18,17 --> 00:20:20,67
and now she's living there with a
bunch of people you know who i knew

335
00:20:20,67 --> 00:20:24,07
when we were all young together and
you know i think it's fantastic

336
00:20:24,07 --> 00:20:25,91
that they've chosen to stay around

337
00:20:25,91 --> 00:20:30,46
and make the best of what their
parents are established there. And.

338
00:20:30,48 --> 00:20:36,59
I suppose you know it would be very hard
to actually to actually say the difference

339
00:20:36,59 --> 00:20:39,78
between those people and the
people who have you know kind of.

340
00:20:40,28 --> 00:20:44,69
How do you say where that
whole thing has collapsed.

341
00:20:46,29 --> 00:20:53,07
It's a bit hard to explain this is
that this generation you know just.

342
00:20:56,14 --> 00:21:01,53
You know i wouldn't say that people
my age choosing to stay in this area

343
00:21:01,53 --> 00:21:04,40
and make a go of it would
be the actual next chapter.

344
00:21:04,68 --> 00:21:09,56
Because a lot more of the people who stay
around end up finding themselves quite

345
00:21:09,56 --> 00:21:13,42
trapped and quite kind of you know
unproductive in that situation

346
00:21:13,42 --> 00:21:18,09
and i suppose there are only a few of them
who've really kind of you know settled

347
00:21:18,09 --> 00:21:22,21
in and wanted to stay there.
I'd say that the next kind of.

348
00:21:22,59 --> 00:21:26,54
Stage in the process of the whole thing
will be a new type of people coming to

349
00:21:26,54 --> 00:21:26,78
that area

350
00:21:27,58 --> 00:21:31,75
and they'll be alternative settlers in
the true sense of the word just like my

351
00:21:31,75 --> 00:21:34,49
parents generation were
but they'll be choosing

352
00:21:34,49 --> 00:21:37,89
that those alternatives for different
kind of reasons and they'll be realizing

353
00:21:37,89 --> 00:21:43,45
that they can still participate in
mainstream society and still have jobs

354
00:21:43,45 --> 00:21:45,52
and still do all of that type of thing

355
00:21:46,56 --> 00:21:50,08
but they don't actually have to live in
the middle of the city in order to do it

356
00:21:50,08 --> 00:21:51,74
and that they can also integrate

357
00:21:51,74 --> 00:21:55,47
that into having a more kind of down to
earth lifestyle and you know you see

358
00:21:55,47 --> 00:21:58,76
that kind of thing happening this area quite
a lot where there are people who have

359
00:21:58,76 --> 00:21:59,79
been educated.

360
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,14
And gone to university and
become sort of either doctors

361
00:22:03,14 --> 00:22:07,50
or you know any kind of professions like
that and then chosen to go and practice

362
00:22:07,50 --> 00:22:11,50
or do their thing you know in an area
where they can also live on the land

363
00:22:11,50 --> 00:22:13,87
and have a really sort of
comfortable life like that

364
00:22:13,87 --> 00:22:16,82
and i suppose you know you
could be kind of critical of

365
00:22:16,82 --> 00:22:20,32
that because you know a lot of people
say all those people belong in the city

366
00:22:20,32 --> 00:22:22,89
and that's where they should stay
but i don't necessarily agree with

367
00:22:22,89 --> 00:22:27,33
that i think if you're a writer or you
know a doctor or you know a schoolteacher

368
00:22:27,33 --> 00:22:29,19
or any of those kind of professions

369
00:22:29,19 --> 00:22:32,35
and you wanted to live on the land
animals a perfect place to go

370
00:22:32,35 --> 00:22:34,14
and do it you know and you can.

371
00:22:34,49 --> 00:22:39,52
You know have a small block of land
like the you know permaculture plots

372
00:22:39,52 --> 00:22:42,71
that are coming up now and stuff like
that you could have a small plot of land

373
00:22:42,71 --> 00:22:45,18
and just get on with it and you know

374
00:22:45,18 --> 00:22:48,01
and live your life the way
you want to in terms of that

375
00:22:48,01 --> 00:22:48,86
and because there's so much.

376
00:22:48,95 --> 00:22:53,35
You know communication sort of technology
becoming available for you to stay

377
00:22:53,35 --> 00:22:56,87
integrated with the rest of society. You
know i think we'll see a lot more of that.

378
00:22:58,39 --> 00:23:03,51
So what do you have a future.
For the area for me.

379
00:23:07,10 --> 00:23:10,62
Well i hope that the process that

380
00:23:10,62 --> 00:23:17,23
that is happening now continues to happen
which is like people realizing what are

381
00:23:17,23 --> 00:23:20,11
the good parts and what are the
bad parts out of the alternative

382
00:23:20,11 --> 00:23:21,08
that they've created

383
00:23:22,10 --> 00:23:26,14
and actually you know starting to to
look at it all in the positive sense of

384
00:23:26,14 --> 00:23:26,87
creating

385
00:23:26,87 --> 00:23:30,22
and maintaining something that's really
going to work not just something

386
00:23:30,22 --> 00:23:35,37
that will help them to survive running away
from everything else you know because a

387
00:23:35,37 --> 00:23:39,15
lot of people really did just run
there for shelter from a society

388
00:23:39,15 --> 00:23:40,68
that was running off the rails you know.

389
00:23:40,74 --> 00:23:46,45
And now they've done that it's time to
start maintaining the good parts of it

390
00:23:46,45 --> 00:23:49,71
and you know just like in the garden
making the good parts of the grow

391
00:23:49,71 --> 00:23:54,21
and getting rid of the stuff that that
you don't need. And what about you.

392
00:23:54,25 --> 00:23:59,77
Do you think it's i mean.
You know. Well we live.

393
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,40
You know in the main part of town for
about 10 years and so i've had plenty of

394
00:24:04,40 --> 00:24:08,79
that now but you know if i you
know ever wanted to settle down

395
00:24:08,79 --> 00:24:11,96
and kind of live in a you
know family situation

396
00:24:11,96 --> 00:24:14,66
or in a community situation i
would definitely choose this area

397
00:24:14,66 --> 00:24:17,60
and whether it was kind of
in the actual nimbin valley

398
00:24:17,60 --> 00:24:19,08
or in the surrounding communities

399
00:24:19,08 --> 00:24:23,77
or you know just in the general area
like you know bangalow way or ever.

400
00:24:24,33 --> 00:24:25,21
You know i know

401
00:24:25,21 --> 00:24:29,86
that i'll always be have ties with this
area because you know the land feels so

402
00:24:29,86 --> 00:24:34,65
good to me here and that i
definitely want to go and you know.

403
00:24:34,73 --> 00:24:37,73
Shake it up a little bit in the city
first and travel around the world

404
00:24:37,73 --> 00:24:41,34
and all those kind of things you
know and and meet the kind of people

405
00:24:41,34 --> 00:24:44,32
that would have never even conceived of
anything like nimbin because there's a

406
00:24:44,32 --> 00:24:47,84
whole world of fascinating people out there
who are doing totally different things

407
00:24:47,84 --> 00:24:51,55
to that you know and it's not as
though there's just sort of sydney

408
00:24:51,55 --> 00:24:53,46
and melbourne and then the alternative to

409
00:24:53,46 --> 00:24:57,33
that is you know living up on a community
is sort of a whole other strata as a

410
00:24:57,33 --> 00:25:02,77
society that you know that i
want to get into as well. So.

411
00:25:04,64 --> 00:25:09,09
That's fine. Years.

412
00:25:09,36 --> 00:25:11,96
You know.

413
00:25:11,97 --> 00:25:17,23
I think i can tell a story that makes.

414
00:25:18,63 --> 00:25:23,16
All of the positive things that is had about
as communities look really bad. I can.

415
00:25:24,60 --> 00:25:28,16
Well most of the people when i
was really young about four

416
00:25:28,16 --> 00:25:32,06
or five years old all the people living out
on tumble were sort of you know pretty

417
00:25:32,06 --> 00:25:33,07
form kind of hippies

418
00:25:33,07 --> 00:25:37,73
and you know we're all pretty much in the
same situation of you know building our

419
00:25:37,73 --> 00:25:41,46
own houses and growing a lot of grass and
selling and stuff like you know one year.

420
00:25:41,68 --> 00:25:44,72
I'm sure you'll hear a few stories about
this is a big bust out of town a ball

421
00:25:44,72 --> 00:25:48,49
and a lot of people got bailed up for
and i was a protest about the way

422
00:25:48,49 --> 00:25:52,01
that it was all done but these people
ended up doing some time. Anyway.

423
00:25:52,10 --> 00:25:54,23
And i remember we were
living in the garden house

424
00:25:55,07 --> 00:25:58,47
and that's right down in the bottom
of the valley where the road comes up

425
00:25:58,47 --> 00:26:02,43
and ends and. That's where everyone
sort of goes into trouble from there.

426
00:26:02,51 --> 00:26:06,33
So you know one night we had this
kind of sound from way up on the hill

427
00:26:07,20 --> 00:26:11,10
and it was a truckload of all of these
people who had been in prison for a couple

428
00:26:11,10 --> 00:26:13,69
of weeks or whatever they were
coming back onto the commune

429
00:26:13,69 --> 00:26:17,83
and they were really really drunk
and they weren't the kind of people

430
00:26:17,83 --> 00:26:20,66
that drank a lot because as i said
they were used to just growing

431
00:26:20,66 --> 00:26:21,67
and smoking grass instead.

432
00:26:22,08 --> 00:26:25,32
And they were old is
absolutely out of their heads

433
00:26:25,32 --> 00:26:28,72
and they came tearing back through
the valley and parked the truck

434
00:26:28,72 --> 00:26:31,45
and came stumbling through
the whole area screaming

435
00:26:31,45 --> 00:26:33,95
and banging on doors
making a hollywood noise

436
00:26:33,95 --> 00:26:36,86
and the whole place was just you know
terrified of what they were doing

437
00:26:37,57 --> 00:26:40,54
and i don't know how it ended up because
last thing i mean it was hiding under my

438
00:26:40,54 --> 00:26:44,75
pillow at the noise of these drunken
hippies stumbling through their community.

439
00:26:44,75 --> 00:26:48,32
You know in victory that they'd been let
out and i'm going to the next morning

440
00:26:48,32 --> 00:26:49,85
and wondered out into the yard

441
00:26:49,85 --> 00:26:53,24
and the whole yard was going to
live with these white patches

442
00:26:53,24 --> 00:26:57,85
that they'd left sort of stumbling
through hurling all over our lawn

443
00:26:57,85 --> 00:27:01,78
and i mean i was appalled because i was
used to them being such kind of peaceful

444
00:27:01,78 --> 00:27:03,89
people but to see them on the rampage like

445
00:27:03,89 --> 00:27:08,31
that as kind of a whole you know all of
these hippies must have a bit of you know

446
00:27:08,31 --> 00:27:09,07
straight in them.

447
00:27:09,41 --> 00:27:17,18
As well as traits having a
bit of you in them as well.

448
00:27:18,16 --> 00:27:18,40
Because you.

449
00:27:20,10 --> 00:27:26,74
Was there was no they didn't have wild
names at all. Actually your generous.

450
00:27:26,82 --> 00:27:32,87
No no no they didn't. All the hippy kids
and you had you know. Names like ours.

451
00:27:32,89 --> 00:27:34,21
And.

452
00:27:35,37 --> 00:27:37,91
And i suppose there were some
pretty wild adventures at school

453
00:27:38,69 --> 00:27:44,71
but not really the kind
of things i can describe.

454
00:27:45,71 --> 00:27:46,99
I think in primary school.

455
00:27:47,12 --> 00:27:52,40
All of the hippie kids kind of picked up
on on the straight routine quite fast

456
00:27:52,40 --> 00:27:56,38
because you know we had the school
socials and we had kind of you know

457
00:27:56,38 --> 00:27:59,91
that youth group and stuff like
that and hippie kids and say kids.

458
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:01,22
All treated that is actually the same way

459
00:28:01,22 --> 00:28:04,55
and we you know we all knew how
much fun it was to get dressed up

460
00:28:04,55 --> 00:28:07,31
and get into music and you
know door that type of thing.

461
00:28:07,32 --> 00:28:12,04
And so there was you know it was no big
deal there at all if you give me a minute

462
00:28:12,04 --> 00:28:18,22
i'll be able to think of funny
stories when. I also remember.

463
00:28:19,25 --> 00:28:22,91
A lot of kind of parties and things
like that the my parents took me to

464
00:28:22,91 --> 00:28:26,16
when i was young and
especially around the times

465
00:28:26,16 --> 00:28:29,48
and i you three first of all it
was a 10 years after festival.

466
00:28:29,65 --> 00:28:33,88
Remember seeing kind of their
insane type of parties

467
00:28:33,88 --> 00:28:36,78
that they used to set up in the halls out
there like there was the blue knob hall

468
00:28:36,78 --> 00:28:39,95
which was famous for big sort of end
of year parties and things like that

469
00:28:39,95 --> 00:28:44,66
and they had a lot of mask parties
and a lot of that type of thing

470
00:28:44,66 --> 00:28:46,99
and at each one of these parties
there were certain things

471
00:28:46,99 --> 00:28:51,27
that were guaranteed you'd always have a
whole load of people with really long

472
00:28:51,27 --> 00:28:54,49
dreadlocks kind of standing around playing
percussion you know in the main hall

473
00:28:54,49 --> 00:28:57,44
and a lot of people jumping around to
that and a lot of kids running around

474
00:28:58,23 --> 00:28:59,11
and then behind

475
00:28:59,11 --> 00:29:02,70
that there was always some kind of kitchen
where someone would have set up a height

476
00:29:02,70 --> 00:29:07,15
of really bizarre food. I mean foods
are pretty loose term but then you

477
00:29:07,15 --> 00:29:11,65
and they'd be really stone people
eating just eating this stuff insanely

478
00:29:11,65 --> 00:29:13,64
and behind that if you

479
00:29:13,64 --> 00:29:16,99
when you go out the back door of these holes
you generally just like a big patch of

480
00:29:16,99 --> 00:29:18,99
grass out there and it always be a bonfire

481
00:29:18,99 --> 00:29:23,02
and these people with really kind of nerdy
dreadlocks sitting really in close to

482
00:29:23,02 --> 00:29:25,99
the fire and just sort of staring into
the phone tripping off their heads

483
00:29:26,82 --> 00:29:30,16
and it would just go on and on and
on and people just kind of circulate

484
00:29:30,16 --> 00:29:32,87
and you go out and sit by the fire
fry and get warm and then you go in

485
00:29:32,87 --> 00:29:36,03
and eat some of this food and you
go and listen to music for a while

486
00:29:36,03 --> 00:29:38,24
and you just keep going you know all night

487
00:29:38,24 --> 00:29:43,42
and these to make these amazing kind of
brews of with magic mushrooms like a china

488
00:29:43,42 --> 00:29:44,90
tea with magic mushrooms in it

489
00:29:44,90 --> 00:29:49,81
and some people would just be you know
drinking the stuff by by the liter and.

490
00:29:50,19 --> 00:29:52,98
I mean i thought some pretty
incredible things i suppose

491
00:29:52,98 --> 00:29:53,69
and they don't really seem

492
00:29:53,69 --> 00:29:56,44
that bizarre to me because i've seen
those people doing that for years

493
00:29:57,36 --> 00:29:59,90
and it seems like a natural way
to celebrate to me but it.

494
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,73
If you went there for the first time you
really be amazed at the castle fees to do

495
00:30:04,90 --> 00:30:08,15
remember the 1983 festival
seeing a similar kind of thing.

496
00:30:08,34 --> 00:30:13,10
I mean they're all of the normal
type of pursuits like you know.

497
00:30:13,12 --> 00:30:19,61
Is a train going to ruin years so they're
all the sort of normal festival things to

498
00:30:19,61 --> 00:30:24,49
do like you know the music and the
sweat lodge and all that type of thing

499
00:30:24,49 --> 00:30:26,16
and running around in the fields

500
00:30:26,16 --> 00:30:30,36
and then i remember seeing a group of
trippers a festival who were all sitting

501
00:30:30,36 --> 00:30:34,62
around in this massive kind of circle
holding hands and staring up at the sky

502
00:30:34,62 --> 00:30:37,66
and sort of chanting these
really is really weird chance

503
00:30:37,66 --> 00:30:38,45
and i mean we're watching it

504
00:30:38,45 --> 00:30:42,68
and actually trying to sort out what they
were doing and i really just gave up

505
00:30:42,68 --> 00:30:45,89
and walked away because i
couldn't i couldn't understand.

506
00:30:45,91 --> 00:30:49,54
You know what they're actually
going for it all the hoes.

507
00:30:50,22 --> 00:30:53,75
I suppose the funny things that i
used to see where the kind of things

508
00:30:53,75 --> 00:30:54,80
that people would get up to

509
00:30:54,80 --> 00:30:59,04
when they were stone in the actual streets
as a child i didn't have any problem

510
00:30:59,04 --> 00:31:01,84
with kind of watching quite closely the
type of things that they were doing

511
00:31:01,84 --> 00:31:05,32
and not actually being offended by it
but just sort of checking them out.

512
00:31:05,55 --> 00:31:05,73
I remember.

513
00:31:06,35 --> 00:31:10,41
You know the kind of really derelict hippies
who who you know don't change their

514
00:31:10,41 --> 00:31:14,33
clothes for weeks and stuff like that
and they would get really really drunk

515
00:31:14,33 --> 00:31:17,24
or smash in the street and
it's kind of sit there either.

516
00:31:17,48 --> 00:31:21,04
Either begging or or trying to
irritate people as they walk past

517
00:31:21,04 --> 00:31:24,31
and i swear to watch of ours
and just sort of you know try

518
00:31:24,31 --> 00:31:25,49
and work out where they were coming from

519
00:31:25,49 --> 00:31:27,90
and i remember this one guy
who's a famous character.
