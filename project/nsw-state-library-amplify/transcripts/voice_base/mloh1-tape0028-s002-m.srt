00:00:01,49 --> 00:00:04,73
Type identification this
is an interview with mr.

2
00:00:04,73 --> 00:00:07,55
David irvine coming in
as david owen who is

3
00:00:07,55 --> 00:00:11,31
a boilermaker on the sydney harbour bridge.
You served your time in the early days

4
00:00:11,31 --> 00:00:16,82
in the first belfast what it. Yes
yes i served my time in belfast

5
00:00:18,12 --> 00:00:24,53
work when clark. It was in the same street
of the same road as town and world. We

6
00:00:24,53 --> 00:00:29,27
call it the week yard work when clark.
They work nine or three quarter hours

7
00:00:29,27 --> 00:00:35,59
a day. And no work no pay. I was apprentice
i don't know what my father gave paid

8
00:00:35,59 --> 00:00:40,64
for my apprenticeship. Well as the moment
i went to serve my time but i am and i am

9
00:00:40,64 --> 00:00:41,36
not

10
00:00:41,36 --> 00:00:46,57
a pure magic home where an ordinary hammer
and two of us were knocking rivers lines

11
00:00:48,38 --> 00:00:55,21
and my dad what he paid as i said before
i don't know but we work nine or three

12
00:00:55,21 --> 00:00:55,74
quarter hours

13
00:00:55,74 --> 00:01:00,65
a day and we did not work. We never got
paid with one piece work. You've got to

14
00:01:00,65 --> 00:01:05,95
take it out on the right on the open and
we're right to post all weathers. And when

15
00:01:05,95 --> 00:01:11,04
i serve my eventually finish my five years
apprenticeship. Of course i'll bet camp

16
00:01:11,04 --> 00:01:12,17
your marriage hammers then there was

17
00:01:12,17 --> 00:01:18,28
a lot of pure magic revelling. And i went
up to get my journeyman's tickets and

18
00:01:18,28 --> 00:01:23,22
they told me that i guess likely pit did
two weeks to pull up. That was through the

19
00:01:23,22 --> 00:01:26,77
wet weather that we rock and when i
lost 100 actually six years of my

20
00:01:26,77 --> 00:01:31,66
apprenticeship. So did you go to technical
school while you were doing your time in

21
00:01:31,66 --> 00:01:35,38
those days. No technical school to teach
you the hardest knock rivers down with

22
00:01:35,38 --> 00:01:42,36
a hammer was just and that his job was still
not his job. But we had very big ships

23
00:01:42,36 --> 00:01:46,98
we build are next door to us. One of the
outstanding things that i can remember was

24
00:01:47,96 --> 00:01:54,11
. Witnessing the launching of the titanic.
You know and was. 911 that was the first

25
00:01:54,11 --> 00:01:56,59
ship i saw launched. I was

26
00:01:56,59 --> 00:02:01,87
a boy about ten years old and. I don't get
my age wayne and i did you actually work

27
00:02:01,87 --> 00:02:05,87
on the titanic. You know that was an old
and world that was in the big shipyard.

28
00:02:06,31 --> 00:02:12,19
But shipyard just beside each other and
one was what we call the we are the big

29
00:02:12,19 --> 00:02:16,83
garden. Do you embody talk about the
titanic when it was launched. I know was

30
00:02:16,83 --> 00:02:21,81
a perfect launching but we all know the
disaster now you can read about the

31
00:02:21,81 --> 00:02:24,73
disaster if you want any doctors up here
you've got the doctors in there are

32
00:02:24,73 --> 00:02:27,71
doctors up here and up the moment you
know these read about the time of the day

33
00:02:27,71 --> 00:02:32,15
time with all the literature they keep in
there when in those days when you worked

34
00:02:32,15 --> 00:02:38,29
on the on the ships in the yard at belfast
was the work hard from start to start

35
00:02:38,29 --> 00:02:43,03
very hard of you didn't. Well said before.
Priscilla i love you didn't work. You

36
00:02:43,03 --> 00:02:47,74
didn't get paid the harder you work the
more you earned. How did that work

37
00:02:49,87 --> 00:02:51,63
where you worked for a number
of rivets you put down

38
00:02:51,63 --> 00:02:57,43
a do they give you so much per hundred. So
much per hundred varied and prices. Well

39
00:02:57,43 --> 00:03:01,91
a pendant where you worked your member
how much was in those days. Yes i was

40
00:03:01,91 --> 00:03:05,32
earning my. Twenty shillings

41
00:03:05,32 --> 00:03:10,92
a week which was exceptionally good no stage
as an apprentice twenty one shillings

42
00:03:11,80 --> 00:03:16,78
. In the war came on they give
us all a twenty once a guinea

43
00:03:16,78 --> 00:03:19,55
a week bonus. Whether you want
to not you just got one guinea

44
00:03:19,55 --> 00:03:25,59
a week extra on your money and the war years
in the first world war and you were to

45
00:03:25,59 --> 00:03:29,22
the shipyards there all through the war.
All through this. Did you build naval

46
00:03:29,22 --> 00:03:36,08
ships there. No never. Ships know all
merchant ships. White star line. Of

47
00:03:36,08 --> 00:03:38,05
titanic mm. There was

48
00:03:38,05 --> 00:03:43,84
a larger ships flood in those days. No
warships built in your you know what ships

49
00:03:43,84 --> 00:03:50,75
at all. Things got flak right about 1923
and. I was never out of work really and

50
00:03:50,75 --> 00:03:52,85
i saw where they were building

51
00:03:52,85 --> 00:03:58,10
a harbour bridge here and i wrote the
doorman longs and they said that i would i

52
00:03:58,10 --> 00:04:02,39
think they probably employ me. Which i
did like about iran about twenty three

53
00:04:02,39 --> 00:04:08,91
twenty four and i got the harbor bridge
and from there i had five years there

54
00:04:08,91 --> 00:04:15,24
a foreman river. And workshops and from
there we went over the comedy wow and work

55
00:04:15,24 --> 00:04:17,64
during all the more than

56
00:04:17,65 --> 00:04:24,33
a million times and has been that meeting
with him cockatoo talk who are where did

57
00:04:24,33 --> 00:04:28,99
you start then and the war years i was there
all during the war 1940 forty two. Is

58
00:04:28,99 --> 00:04:34,22

five. You worked with larry short i

59
00:04:34,22 --> 00:04:39,12

One of the greatest chaps i ever met my

60
00:04:39,12 --> 00:04:44,85
life was only short he didn't work. Wrong
with me he was. He was an hour and work

61
00:04:44,85 --> 00:04:45,76
credits from me for

62
00:04:45,76 --> 00:04:50,09
a few days. Not long. Not long enough
because i had them forever of me to stay

63
00:04:50,09 --> 00:04:55,62
because he was an outstanding personality
in the shops. He was an arm worker and

64
00:04:57,17 --> 00:05:02,95
eventually became chairman of the committees.
Do you member any of those meetings

65
00:05:02,95 --> 00:05:06,46
and he was union meetings there. Oh yes
meetings there and meetings there very

66
00:05:06,46 --> 00:05:13,33
often with phillips and phillips and don
used to come over there really. Often. And

67
00:05:13,33 --> 00:05:16,29
what used to happen those body laurie was
laurie was already capable of handling

68
00:05:16,29 --> 00:05:23,25
and i can always remember
her. Lori's. Trying

69
00:05:23,26 --> 00:05:27,72
to phillips all the time polluters only
that put in the wedge and either that and

70
00:05:27,72 --> 00:05:33,43
sorry you started. I forgot to put the
wedge at the day. This little this little

71
00:05:33,43 --> 00:05:35,63
wedge was already going in but larry was

72
00:05:35,63 --> 00:05:38,93
a fine chap we used to go to the
domain to listen to him. He had

73
00:05:38,93 --> 00:05:42,88
a lot of friends. You know want to
be a fellow. You know he's done

74
00:05:42,88 --> 00:05:43,81
a lot of good for

75
00:05:43,81 --> 00:05:48,81
a lot of people that people know nothing
about. What about at the at the shipyard.

76
00:05:48,87 --> 00:05:53,64
Do you member him to dob you
emblem challenging thornton as

77
00:05:53,64 --> 00:05:59,69
a first time. Secretary. You
know. Yes well you see a bit of

78
00:05:59,69 --> 00:06:04,52
a go down and that was really their own
work as it was their trouble. But i

79
00:06:04,52 --> 00:06:09,14
remember they treated. Larry very very badly
were very sore about the treatment he

80
00:06:09,14 --> 00:06:11,74
got at the key once he got a bit of

81
00:06:11,74 --> 00:06:15,63
a bashing there are these commas that
whatever they wear i don't know what they

82
00:06:15,63 --> 00:06:20,09
were but he came out top anyway and
he's on the right place. They have

83
00:06:20,09 --> 00:06:24,27
a look back since they got him in there.
Do you remember any of the shock committee

84
00:06:24,27 --> 00:06:28,39
meetings do you did you ever attended he
was shot committee meetings shot meetings

85
00:06:28,39 --> 00:06:31,00
that we had a pretty regular we had

86
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:37,88
a pretty regular but nothing outstanding
during the war. We're all pretty loyal.

87
00:06:39,92 --> 00:06:40,02
There's

88
00:06:40,03 --> 00:06:44,32
a lot of trouble in belfast where you came
from and what year was it these stairs

89
00:06:45,10 --> 00:06:48,10
only twenty three you came here is
when did you first start serving your

90
00:06:48,10 --> 00:06:54,52
apprenticeship 1914 1914
thirteen was only thirteen them.

91
00:06:55,94 --> 00:07:01,45
Do you remember belfast in those days my
word i do. Yeah three some very hard times

92
00:07:01,45 --> 00:07:07,04
national strikes. National strike the
place was in darkness. And we had the

93
00:07:07,04 --> 00:07:12,57
upheavals there and 1916. Now the dublin
rebellion of course everybody knows about

94
00:07:12,57 --> 00:07:19,17
that. Well it came up in the belfast.
And that as more or less intensified me

95
00:07:19,17 --> 00:07:22,42
coming to this country because they put

96
00:07:22,42 --> 00:07:31,56
a curfew on. And you can realize even

97
00:07:31,57 --> 00:07:36,00
realize at twilight in the
summertime you've got

98
00:07:36,00 --> 00:07:42,87
a twelve hours. You work twelve sleep
and play twelve. And all the boys

99
00:07:42,87 --> 00:07:46,73
when you were on our age we went with
park plenty of park to play and they put

100
00:07:46,73 --> 00:07:52,35
a curfew on it. We had to be indoors at
7:30 every night. And if you weren't

101
00:07:52,35 --> 00:07:58,50
indoors you know walk around we are these
damned soldiers there they were running

102
00:07:58,50 --> 00:08:02,39
around with guns they can only handle
them and if you didn't keep your hands up

103
00:08:02,39 --> 00:08:06,77
when they took you they tutor. So you might
up to what mile after go to the police

104
00:08:06,77 --> 00:08:11,55
station we rode on after
7:30. So there was a hell of

105
00:08:11,55 --> 00:08:15,79
a lot of people like me. They went to
different companies. Did you ever get married

106
00:08:15,79 --> 00:08:17,34
up like that. I guess

107
00:08:17,34 --> 00:08:24,34
a pickup once find twenty one shillings
right want one guinea. Do everything

108
00:08:24,34 --> 00:08:24,98
else when you were

109
00:08:24,98 --> 00:08:29,38
a boy. Never. And never want to do it again
because the back of beyond your them

110
00:08:29,38 --> 00:08:34,59
guns. Is probably soldiers they were no
good. They're all young fellow come out of

111
00:08:34,59 --> 00:08:39,52
the war and i didn't see much. No not much
more they were more there was enough.

112
00:08:42,03 --> 00:08:47,12
Remember when you earlier when you
were a boy. Earlier when you were

113
00:08:47,12 --> 00:08:53,56
a boy at thirty years ago. Eighty four
years ago she was you ever going to school

114
00:08:53,56 --> 00:08:58,55
in belfast what was school like an art
school a very good very good. And

115
00:08:58,55 --> 00:09:04,80
a matter of fact there and that is your
handwriting is very good. It's going to

116
00:09:04,80 --> 00:09:06,49
tell you a story there. I went to

117
00:09:06,49 --> 00:09:13,24
a doctor recently here. And i write
at the different prescriptions that i

118
00:09:13,24 --> 00:09:17,82
have and the medicines that i was taking.
And all these medical need names i have

119
00:09:17,82 --> 00:09:22,08
a right on the paper and i wrote it on the
paper and i took it into the doctor and

120
00:09:22,08 --> 00:09:27,17
i challenge i'm having no regret it. Where
did you learn to write like that. He

121
00:09:27,18 --> 00:09:31,61
said i've never seen writing like that
since my dad left ireland. I said well

122
00:09:31,61 --> 00:09:36,03
that's right. I came from belfast. And when
i said belfast he never looked at me. I

123
00:09:36,03 --> 00:09:40,42
thought he was going to cut my throat because
he come from dublin. So you can read

124
00:09:40,42 --> 00:09:46,35
the link for yourself. Apartment
it. Street. When you were

125
00:09:46,35 --> 00:09:49,09
a boy. Belfast when you were

126
00:09:49,09 --> 00:09:55,88
a boy it must be something.
During the first war you were in

127
00:09:55,88 --> 00:10:02,16
a reserved occupation of the shipyards
weren't you. Yes i was but i. I

128
00:10:02,58 --> 00:10:07,41
committed i don't know what it was an
unpardonable sin or not. I joined up when i

129
00:10:07,41 --> 00:10:13,38
was sixteen under my brother's name. And
i was just ready to go overseas i was in

130
00:10:13,38 --> 00:10:16,17
the royal field artillery as

131
00:10:16,17 --> 00:10:22,39
a driver and i went through all over the
business of the soldier and just read an

132
00:10:22,39 --> 00:10:28,45
expeditionary life. When they woke up
that i was going to the shipyard and they

133
00:10:28,45 --> 00:10:31,05
discharged me and i bet it was

134
00:10:31,05 --> 00:10:34,84
a very funny since of my brother's name
every time i called robert there are mine.

135
00:10:34,91 --> 00:10:40,62
There was no rubber there i find there so
they got you on there when i got me there

136
00:10:40,62 --> 00:10:44,92
you know it and i've had quite a bit
of experience there when you were

137
00:10:44,92 --> 00:10:48,91
a young lad what you what i used to do in
the spare time in belfast in those days.

141
00:11:00,47 --> 00:11:07,27
miles for the shipyard three mother and
three melbourne but they didn't i didn't

142
00:11:07,27 --> 00:11:09,79

143
00:11:09,79 --> 00:11:14,14

whether depression has started that the
depression hadn't started there. No one

162
00:12:24,99 --> 00:12:29,96

good money over there. Bills still they
