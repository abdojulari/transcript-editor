1
00:00:00,04 --> 00:00:01,95
I'm talking to mr.

2
00:00:01,95 --> 00:00:04,18
Clary erdman who when he was

3
00:00:04,18 --> 00:00:08,15
a lot younger. He worked on the building
of the sydney harbour bridge in one

4
00:00:08,15 --> 00:00:13,07
section where were you born. Mr. And when
born in dolby queensland. When were you

5
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:18,36
born there are more in the ten to mine.
Why do you know five weeks if their age.

6
00:00:19,68 --> 00:00:25,71
What was your father my father.
Well he was a teamster. She was

7
00:00:25,71 --> 00:00:32,30
a teamster he passed away when i was
three and my mother married again and

8
00:00:33,49 --> 00:00:40,10
she died when i was thirteen. So i was left
practically an orphan of the storm. But

9
00:00:40,10 --> 00:00:45,50
i've battled around and done did various
works in the country you know gone down

10
00:00:45,50 --> 00:00:52,33
the farms and different things like that
and eventually i went to be toria you got

11
00:00:52,33 --> 00:00:59,12
it all went to victoria and i worked on
different farms there and i got sick of the

12
00:00:59,12 --> 00:01:01,88
country. So i came back
to sydney and i got

13
00:01:01,88 --> 00:01:08,81
a few jobs around sydney labouring in
there. So one day i seen an ad in the

14
00:01:08,81 --> 00:01:12,67
paper wanted men for storage work put in

15
00:01:12,67 --> 00:01:18,27
a new sure he's lying. I don't know i can't
remember whether bondo or broadly any i

16
00:01:18,27 --> 00:01:23,32
went out down i was ten minutes too late.
So i thought i'll while i go back to the

17
00:01:23,32 --> 00:01:25,51
city but on the way
back i thought i'd have

18
00:01:25,51 --> 00:01:30,26
a look at the harbour bridge. So only how
i went down and i was standing at the

19
00:01:30,26 --> 00:01:31,64
gate having

20
00:01:31,64 --> 00:01:37,38
a look around you know to see the progress
and. A cap past me and he said what are

21
00:01:37,38 --> 00:01:41,57
you looking for work and i said
oh yes i am he said hang on

22
00:01:41,57 --> 00:01:46,90
a man that he said might be able to
get you on. So he went away for about

23
00:01:46,90 --> 00:01:50,50
a quarter of an hour and he came back he
said i want you to go up there and see

24
00:01:50,50 --> 00:01:53,19
a man called mr foley when mr.

25
00:01:53,19 --> 00:01:58,63
Foley was like a ride and gang it
was i so any i went up and seen mr.

26
00:01:58,63 --> 00:02:04,80
Foley and i only have an overcoat singlet
on and try our tv pretty poor and them

27
00:02:04,80 --> 00:02:08,13
days so i seen mr.

28
00:02:08,13 --> 00:02:12,42
Foley and he said take off your overcoat
so i'm so i took off me. Overcoat. Oh by

29
00:02:12,42 --> 00:02:16,61
the way i was only about twenty three
years of age then so i took my with the

30
00:02:16,61 --> 00:02:20,44
overcoat an easier ride oh he said put
it down area should go and get it in and

31
00:02:20,44 --> 00:02:23,34
pick up some rivers. So only
are we doing that for quite

32
00:02:23,34 --> 00:02:28,21
a while. And then. By came to me that mr.

33
00:02:28,21 --> 00:02:31,30
Foley came to me and said i
want you to go up there to mr.

34
00:02:31,30 --> 00:02:32,46
Barr. Now it was

35
00:02:32,46 --> 00:02:37,22
a foreman carpenter on the gantries so
any i worked on the gantry for quite

36
00:02:37,22 --> 00:02:39,30
a while and then mr.

37
00:02:39,30 --> 00:02:44,46
Miller that was the superintendent on the
door of point so i. He put me in there

38
00:02:44,46 --> 00:02:45,99
but they call the tenant was

39
00:02:45,99 --> 00:02:52,95
a support sharps that's where the cable
so supportive dishpan in our work and

40
00:02:52,95 --> 00:02:53,38
there for quite

41
00:02:53,38 --> 00:02:59,09
a while and what were you doing there. I
drooling the rock i wear on what they call

42
00:02:59,09 --> 00:03:04,14
an english store brand rock welding machine.
There was quite appeal before if i was

43
00:03:04,14 --> 00:03:09,32
down there in that time was so they were
paramount the powder monkeys name was

44
00:03:09,32 --> 00:03:13,00
kelly i can't think of each
christian name but any hour after

45
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:18,24
a while i got to have been taking him by
an underground and then i thought i'd have

46
00:03:18,24 --> 00:03:24,76
a look at another job somewhere else. Anyhow.
Excuse me i went onto the approach to

47
00:03:24,76 --> 00:03:25,68
the harbour bridge in

48
00:03:25,68 --> 00:03:31,81
a concrete gang and rambo called charlie
leeds and that was the gang as name so i

49
00:03:31,81 --> 00:03:32,98
worked on bet for quite

50
00:03:32,98 --> 00:03:39,40
a while and finished up leaving it
there when you were on the tunnels.

51
00:03:39,41 --> 00:03:45,45
Were drilling holes vertically or horizontally
to get terrorist copic all. About

52
00:03:45,45 --> 00:03:52,24
horizontal into the rock face. And
how well it was started or they were

53
00:03:52,24 --> 00:03:58,98
down about fifteen feet or twenty feet in
them days. I suppose about what five or

54
00:03:58,98 --> 00:04:05,93
six metres and then how. How
many feet did you go to the end.

55
00:04:05,93 --> 00:04:11,00
How did you go down to the bottom. I dug
in my really and by how far down did you

56
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:15,61
go about i don't the day over the right
down to the bottom of the tunnel. I think

57
00:04:15,61 --> 00:04:20,21
it was about 240 feet. So you were there
and right the way through until it was

58
00:04:20,21 --> 00:04:24,26
finished. We're going you know not told us
finish now when i got down to the bottom

59
00:04:24,26 --> 00:04:29,48
. I don't that's when i left. I went up 240
for about their day here is what i was

60
00:04:29,48 --> 00:04:36,26
at with the tunnels on that i couldn't
tell you how big round or no they were

61
00:04:36,26 --> 00:04:41,70
square where time on how
many when they were there be

62
00:04:41,70 --> 00:04:47,17
a bigger two through right. Hundred twenty
eight cables but you didn't see the

63
00:04:47,17 --> 00:04:50,97
cables. No i didn't see the cable but
then i left before then what about the

64
00:04:50,97 --> 00:04:54,01
concreting at the bottom. Did you have
it you know i had nothing to do with the

65
00:04:54,01 --> 00:04:59,11
concreting only the drilling of the rock.
And there and did you keep on drilling

66
00:04:59,11 --> 00:05:05,10
all the time and somebody else did the
rock yes i would rather shovelling out

67
00:05:05,10 --> 00:05:09,50
a rock and we were drilling. Four or
five hours on the drill two men to

68
00:05:09,50 --> 00:05:13,06
a drill. You have to hold the drill
up yours is and i have dialed

69
00:05:13,06 --> 00:05:19,06
a drill up in your hand and it was
no stand. Heavy work hard. Or

70
00:05:19,78 --> 00:05:24,76
reasonably hard time but no money would
have good. Good. You could ever want the

71
00:05:24,76 --> 00:05:27,61
money was yes i think it was
Â£6 twelve and fivepence

72
00:05:27,61 --> 00:05:34,40
a week for about forty hour week
then we were on forty hours. And how

73
00:05:35,38 --> 00:05:38,76
long were you actually there
on those tunnels. I was on

74
00:05:38,76 --> 00:05:43,48
a time on it i suppose to be
eighteen months two years and with

75
00:05:43,48 --> 00:05:46,75
a nearly finished when you
got. Oh yes he's done

76
00:05:46,75 --> 00:05:51,40
a penny. So you would have started what
will be but twenty twenty six twenty six

77
00:05:51,40 --> 00:05:55,35
and twenty seven. I started there
and i was there for about two and

78
00:05:55,35 --> 00:06:01,04
a half three years because the tunnels were
actually put into use in 1928 when the

79
00:06:01,04 --> 00:06:07,30
ice right here. I left about 1927 i
think it was for the early part of 1928

80
00:06:10,08 --> 00:06:15,62
. And you did you go down there and see
that the cables in position later on. Yes i

81
00:06:15,62 --> 00:06:19,86
seen i mean pinned i didn't go down as you
are now but i seen the gable support my

82
00:06:19,86 --> 00:06:25,55
stance span and i yet i i followed it right
through and i don't know what you need

83
00:06:25,55 --> 00:06:31,02
to do come under and that i was on the
oh you no you stray and workers union in

84
00:06:31,02 --> 00:06:35,80
them days. You remember who the
delicate was and i can't think of

85
00:06:35,80 --> 00:06:37,91
a delegate but i think the secretary was

86
00:06:37,91 --> 00:06:44,90
a blow by the name of bodkin
and vodka and was the

87
00:06:44,90 --> 00:06:51,11
work. I mean it was there any precautions
to stop the dust. Now you know we had no

88
00:06:51,11 --> 00:06:56,64
precautions to stop and was not water. I
know. Also you don't want to go through

89
00:06:56,64 --> 00:07:01,33
the drills. As you're drilling those want
to go through the drill. So there was no

90
00:07:01,33 --> 00:07:07,57
dash attached to it at all. There wasn't
dusty down there no no no no doubts no i

91
00:07:07,58 --> 00:07:14,48
was very good. When they got to the
bottom right tell me they dago cut out of

92
00:07:14,48 --> 00:07:19,54
a hole in the bottom because the water
starter seep in. They had pumped on it but i

93
00:07:19,54 --> 00:07:24,79
wasn't there. There was no water running
in from the harbor where you were now. How

94
00:07:25,52 --> 00:07:29,68
are you were there on the digging where
they were dug the skew backs for the

95
00:07:30,73 --> 00:07:36,66
bearings were you. Now you know now. Was
there going on at the time was it was i

96
00:07:36,66 --> 00:07:42,14
think really. Already finished going on
at that time. Verify anything go and they

97
00:07:42,14 --> 00:07:46,26
only charge you know we. After
we got down a certain way

98
00:07:46,26 --> 00:07:49,19
a certain depth. We came to

99
00:07:49,19 --> 00:07:53,84
a concrete and then so they were sell us
where they used to tie the prisoners up in

100
00:07:53,84 --> 00:08:00,21
they had the the rings in the walls and
everything. What was that unless there was

101
00:08:00,21 --> 00:08:06,95
points i didn't notice used to be doors
battery to call game but repeal i

102
00:08:06,95 --> 00:08:11,05
think in them days battery point or
battery you know. So these cells with

103
00:08:11,05 --> 00:08:15,97
a part of the army they'd be part of
the con make things where they put

104
00:08:15,97 --> 00:08:21,68
a convict some of the convicts tied them
up blogger much opposed to being. It was

105
00:08:21,68 --> 00:08:26,56
reims in the war any i suppose haven't how
if i haven't been about twenty or thirty

106
00:08:26,56 --> 00:08:32,60
feet down and nobody knew it was there
before you know and when you. We didn't know

107
00:08:32,60 --> 00:08:39,29
anything today. Photograph it you
know. No i don't think so they

108
00:08:39,30 --> 00:08:41,21
could tell it quite

109
00:08:41,21 --> 00:08:45,21
a while we were going down below but i
didn't know that you know and we were there

110
00:08:45,21 --> 00:08:50,46
were they broke into this place. They
broke through. Yeah broke through yet. It

111
00:08:50,47 --> 00:08:54,44
sounds as if it was part of doors battery.
You know door battery very likely care

112
00:08:54,44 --> 00:08:54,89
if they called

113
00:08:54,89 --> 00:09:00,71
a battery park or battery or something
like that. A long way from my talking head

114
00:09:00,72 --> 00:09:04,20
again. But we all the guns are still up
there. Yeah younis still up me they reckon

115
00:09:04,20 --> 00:09:11,05
. Yeah yeah. So what did you do next after
the tunnels. After that time it was

116
00:09:11,05 --> 00:09:15,33
that's when i went up onto the approach of
the harbour bridge. I worked on that for

117
00:09:15,33 --> 00:09:15,43
quite

118
00:09:15,43 --> 00:09:23,71
a while and where we were birds
were you working where the.

119
00:09:24,59 --> 00:09:30,91
We about 100 yards back from the bridge
from the start of the bridge was the old

120
00:09:31,69 --> 00:09:38,26
old bridge there. Yeah the argyle
catch somewhere around there we were

121
00:09:38,26 --> 00:09:45,12
in that last. No no no
we were concreting after

122
00:09:45,13 --> 00:09:50,35
that yet and i've been so you there when
they built the bridge over the cap and you

123
00:09:50,35 --> 00:09:57,30
know now. Now i left before that. So where
were you exactly were you further back

124
00:09:57,30 --> 00:10:01,78
than that. Further back than that. Here we
weren't in york street area where there

125
00:10:01,78 --> 00:10:06,18
were the railway tunnels we're going
underneath now you know after that between

126
00:10:06,18 --> 00:10:13,13
that and me me the argyle
cut i suppose it'd

127
00:10:13,13 --> 00:10:17,15
be me hard to tell and then days when
you're up there. You didn't know where you

128
00:10:17,15 --> 00:10:21,56
were were you there before there were
there demolished princes street and upper

129
00:10:21,56 --> 00:10:28,10
fourth street. No. Oh no no that you me
know where the school was there to portray

130
00:10:28,10 --> 00:10:34,85
you know are now on the other side. And
i know where you live. It's where did i

131
00:10:34,85 --> 00:10:35,92
live in sydney in st.

132
00:10:35,92 --> 00:10:41,79
Peters you know leapt into beaters and you
get to work or used to go by tram. The

133
00:10:41,79 --> 00:10:48,09
old tram. You said one day
that you that you met dr.

134
00:10:48,09 --> 00:10:52,54
Redfield do you remember that i met him at
that when not when we were working i yes

135
00:10:52,54 --> 00:10:56,51
we met him quite a few of us meeting
in there. You know partying by is just

136
00:10:56,51 --> 00:11:01,30
a good morning doctor. And so was another
one now. I think his name was mr.

137
00:11:01,30 --> 00:11:06,70
Freeman. I only seen him occasionally they
were on he have something to do with the

138
00:11:06,70 --> 00:11:11,49
bridge. I don't know exactly what it was
the doctor if you will come and talk to

139
00:11:11,49 --> 00:11:16,28
you do you know just used to be the time
of the day he was passing that was all you

140
00:11:16,28 --> 00:11:21,98
know we were there when the bridge
the arch was joined now but i seen

141
00:11:21,98 --> 00:11:26,02
a joint early one morning and
you had to wait till the

142
00:11:26,90 --> 00:11:33,33
a certain temperature and
what did you do after that.

143
00:11:35,85 --> 00:11:37,49
Did i do after that after i left

144
00:11:37,49 --> 00:11:44,13
a bridge. And there you got my

145
00:11:45,77 --> 00:11:49,44
oh i joined the tramway. Right.
I joined the tramway when

146
00:11:49,44 --> 00:11:55,35
a tram conductor and you were out of work
after you left the bridge were you i was

147
00:11:55,35 --> 00:11:56,00
out of work for

148
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:02,37
a little while. And then i was on the
what you comb relief work. Instead to get

149
00:12:02,37 --> 00:12:07,56

153
00:12:29,89 --> 00:12:35,80

on the bridge. You know good money. Here.

154
00:12:35,81 --> 00:12:42,80
And i want me out of work
too long and hard to

155
00:12:42,80 --> 00:12:49,35
say it's so long ago. You can't remember
everything you know because i remember

156
00:12:49,35 --> 00:12:54,58
when i had to go and get the dole where
we have to go down to circular quay and

near the right weight of the benevolent

158
00:12:59,48 --> 00:13:05,99
society. But after that they issued our
tickets when you went to the grocers and if

159
00:13:05,99 --> 00:13:07,55
you were sweet with the grocery if you get

160
00:13:07,55 --> 00:13:14,19
a pack of cigarettes why did hold take it.
But things were very hard. Then they now

161
00:13:14,19 --> 00:13:19,28
i went onto the tram was after that
and after being on the tram as for

162
00:13:19,28 --> 00:13:25,04
a while i decided i didn't
like it. So i went and got

163
00:13:25,05 --> 00:13:32,04
a job in engineering over in glebe and i
decided i'd like to go into the trade so i

164
00:13:32,04 --> 00:13:33,69
went to the technical college for

165
00:13:33,69 --> 00:13:37,88
a while and i learnt the art of oxy in
electrical welding and i joined the

166
00:13:37,88 --> 00:13:44,83
boilermakers union in. Mass to finish
me out till i retired i worked till

167
00:13:44,83 --> 00:13:49,08
i was sixty seven and a half
years of age. So i thought i had

168
00:13:49,08 --> 00:13:55,05
a map. Where did you go to school i
went to school in me in queensland for

169
00:13:55,05 --> 00:13:57,29

00:13:57,29 --> 00:14:03,98
a private school in bexley. Run by the
salvation army. Instead me basically

did you get in there because you were

182
00:14:52,86 --> 00:14:58,79

time. Oh yes. Whereas when you fly over

183
00:14:58,79 --> 00:15:03,66
something. Oh well the air excepted you
as an apprentice at that time. You didn't

184
00:15:03,66 --> 00:15:03,89
go as

185
00:15:03,89 --> 00:15:09,59
a pianist you didn't go apprentice your

186
00:15:09,59 --> 00:15:11,92
weren't here you know went and

then i went and i was accepted in the

188
00:15:16,86 --> 00:15:23,15

a commercial traveller and we came to town
worst and i can remember. I can member

191
00:15:33,47 --> 00:15:40,21
1914. When the war broke
out in 1915 i came

192
00:15:40,21 --> 00:15:47,13

193
00:15:47,13 --> 00:15:53,04
that. No i didn't i tell a lie

and i would say after school for

195
00:15:57,08 --> 00:16:02,05
a while and they shifted to baxley so
that's where i went to school in bags like

196
00:16:04,17 --> 00:16:09,16
what arrangements did they have to make.
To take you to study at the technical

197
00:16:09,16 --> 00:16:12,71
college. I mean i just went
down and put me name down for

198
00:16:12,71 --> 00:16:17,51
a course was the depression and now i know
now that the pressure was established

199
00:16:19,35 --> 00:16:26,27
1937 and. About 1937 you
know more broke out in

200
00:16:26,27 --> 00:16:30,75
1939 i left the trams in 1939 and

201
00:16:33,30 --> 00:16:37,96
and went to work in say she engineering.
So it was the war that made it possible

202
00:16:37,96 --> 00:16:44,85
for you to yet read that all i cared
for where. Possible to get the trade

203
00:16:44,85 --> 00:16:51,79
strike on the tram was oh we're good. You
know way old footboard to you out in

204
00:16:51,79 --> 00:16:56,10
the weather and if it rains. You've
got wet and if it was hot. You've got

205
00:16:56,10 --> 00:17:03,06
overheated so hope you've got
it both ways. Can you remember

206
00:17:03,06 --> 00:17:09,49
any particular jobs that you
do know. I mean after you.

207
00:17:11,83 --> 00:17:18,25
Are no different in different firms
i work furlough i work for i

208
00:17:18,26 --> 00:17:25,03
w edwards building service i work for
archers. And i work for van gelder.

209
00:17:25,05 --> 00:17:31,80
All engineering or welding electrical
welding different equipment hydraulics and

210
00:17:32,67 --> 00:17:36,84
different machine reason things like
that you have any particular jobs.

211
00:17:39,82 --> 00:17:43,79
There's any big jobs it was all
fabricated or fabricating or fabricating

212
00:17:43,79 --> 00:17:47,28
engineering where we're going. So
yeah you know and we work on on

213
00:17:47,28 --> 00:17:53,21
a lot of war equipment bren gun carrying
chavez and mine sweeping equipment.

214
00:17:53,53 --> 00:17:59,33
That was that was about 1940. I went to
join up. But when i went down to the

215
00:17:59,33 --> 00:18:05,06
military barracks they they tore up my
application form and put me on protected

216
00:18:05,06 --> 00:18:12,02
industry. So i never went to
the war. Maybe i might have

217
00:18:12,02 --> 00:18:18,98
been like it. Yeah. You
know when the harbor bridge

218
00:18:18,98 --> 00:18:25,35
was opened there that they know i wasn't
there that day i wasn't there at day but

219
00:18:26,59 --> 00:18:33,06
i heard all about it all the group cut
me the ribbon jack lang hope an up i was

220
00:18:33,06 --> 00:18:39,87
a jack lang man you know i remember. Or

221
00:18:42,32 --> 00:18:42,92
it's going back

222
00:18:42,92 --> 00:18:49,97
a long way. You know you
might have been joke garden.

223
00:18:53,18 --> 00:18:59,44
He was. A what member what sort
of i mean but i mean i knew when

224
00:19:00,39 --> 00:19:06,17
i went as mp i don't i will never know
it might have been john gone took

225
00:19:06,17 --> 00:19:12,79
a long time ago. You can't remember all
these things particularly as you know him i

226
00:19:12,79 --> 00:19:16,94
knew him saving my life. You
know a joke involved with

227
00:19:16,94 --> 00:19:23,22
a magazine you know no no no joke. I'd
want to add up to do with i know you. Were

228
00:19:23,22 --> 00:19:27,73
you involved with the boilermakers union.
No no no i just stay in the ball and i

229
00:19:27,73 --> 00:19:34,42
make the union. Do you remember
charlie brown and charlie

230
00:19:34,43 --> 00:19:34,81
brown

231
00:19:34,81 --> 00:19:40,42
a room with charlie charlie brown he was
apprenticed in the workshops over the north

232
00:19:40,42 --> 00:19:42,78
side. Yes yes. And then he was

233
00:19:42,78 --> 00:19:46,89
a union delegate. That's what i was
asking here. Yes he was a union they have

234
00:19:46,89 --> 00:19:53,21
a good where he was unique alligator and
sydney is in sydney charmless street

235
00:19:56,93 --> 00:20:02,36
. Is there anything else you can remember
about working on the bridge and no other

236
00:20:02,37 --> 00:20:06,84
people who work with. You know i can't
remember any of them now only kelly the

237
00:20:06,84 --> 00:20:12,73
powder monkey. I can't remember any of
their names are now in fact i don't know

238
00:20:12,73 --> 00:20:18,56
whether i had be alive or not. So yea
maybe three now well as i say i was only

239
00:20:18,56 --> 00:20:23,11
about twenty three when i worked on the
harbour bridge and the man i worked with

240
00:20:23,11 --> 00:20:28,95
while they were thirty and forty year old
men so you can just imagine how many of

241
00:20:28,95 --> 00:20:33,78
them would be alive. You can't
think of any juries who might be

242
00:20:33,78 --> 00:20:39,19
a lonely hard time and now now. I can
remember one very his name was lament him but

243
00:20:39,19 --> 00:20:40,66
a bittersweet. He was

244
00:20:40,66 --> 00:20:46,56
a dogman. Was the only bloke i can think
of now. It was an area of island or door

245
00:20:46,56 --> 00:20:51,29
point side he was on the wilson crane you
dog them on one of the little wilson

246
00:20:51,29 --> 00:20:56,40
grange and the wilson cranes where did what
with it was their job they were cotton

247
00:20:56,40 --> 00:21:01,94
timbers along as the gantries went along.
What they they were up on top up on top.

248
00:21:02,12 --> 00:21:02,85
Yes steam with

249
00:21:02,85 --> 00:21:08,32
a steam train yet only if you take used
to take the bags coke up and or up in the

250
00:21:08,32 --> 00:21:14,66
sling. So you would rolled that till now
i wasn't involved with that at all. Now.

251
00:21:15,16 --> 00:21:20,99
So what stage were they when you arrived
there they got those false work. The

252
00:21:20,99 --> 00:21:25,16
oregon falls to before his work was already
up there was it you know i well we were

253
00:21:25,16 --> 00:21:25,76
putting that out

254
00:21:26,46 --> 00:21:31,35
a lot of it with up when i went onto it.
Yes i could call them the gantries. Yet

255
00:21:31,35 --> 00:21:37,42
all twelve twelve. Timbers they were
already oregon timber shares and the

256
00:21:37,42 --> 00:21:42,50
carpenters working on that work. What sort
of equipment were they using what were

257
00:21:42,50 --> 00:21:45,50
they drilling with i think it was

258
00:21:45,50 --> 00:21:51,21
a air drills almost sure it was aired little
bit. The captain was in charge we name

259
00:21:51,21 --> 00:21:54,26
when jimmy bar. Him he was

260
00:21:54,26 --> 00:22:01,08
a foreman and you were often up
there. Did you often go oh yes yes.

261
00:22:01,11 --> 00:22:07,43
Things. Had they started to lay out the
approach spans on top of this timber by the

262
00:22:07,43 --> 00:22:13,19
time you moved from there or not you know
they hadn't put out the approach bandsaws

263
00:22:13,19 --> 00:22:18,75
only the line with the crane running on.
So they were ready to go you know read it

264
00:22:18,75 --> 00:22:22,51
in actually started you know if it was at
that stage you went down the tunnels or

265
00:22:22,51 --> 00:22:28,01
out right as when i went down the timeline
here. So that was very early. I would

266
00:22:28,01 --> 00:22:33,80
think that would be nineteen twenty
six 1926 i think i was about

267
00:22:34,89 --> 00:22:41,08
nine i was nineteen twenty five. I was
twenty nineteen twenty twenty. The

268
00:22:41,08 --> 00:22:47,01
1926. twenty for

269
00:22:48,45 --> 00:22:55,09
the con i'll be 1927 i
think about 1927. So with

270
00:22:55,09 --> 00:22:59,85
a pilot with the apartment towers above
the ground level either pylons were going

271
00:22:59,85 --> 00:23:05,51
up and then days yeah they were concrete
in the pile ten all the all the stonework

272
00:23:05,51 --> 00:23:06,25
that came from

273
00:23:07,08 --> 00:23:11,45
a place called meru you know the quarries
down maria. They used to bring the stone

274
00:23:11,45 --> 00:23:12,81
around an hour and

275
00:23:12,81 --> 00:23:18,60
a boat and i unloaded it underneath. I
guess they aren't allowed it and loaded at

276
00:23:18,60 --> 00:23:25,49
the wharf and they unloaded all the the
gravel fillings. Do you know you know the

277
00:23:25,49 --> 00:23:29,31
crane driver down there. It's you know i
couldn't tell you to crash into i was you

278
00:23:29,31 --> 00:23:29,94
know. Do you have

279
00:23:29,94 --> 00:23:36,11
a crash drivers up on the notice you
know i don't remember them. There's

280
00:23:36,11 --> 00:23:41,33
a lot along on the bridge. You never
knew their name and say there was

281
00:23:41,33 --> 00:23:42,66
a terrible lot of scotchman

282
00:23:42,66 --> 00:23:47,77
a lot of the englishmen that came out
here especial for that work there were

283
00:23:47,77 --> 00:23:51,77
brought out they were there. I don't know
where they were brought out i'm not i

284
00:23:51,77 --> 00:23:56,58
can't remember when i brought out i just
came out on their own bat and i've heard

285
00:23:56,58 --> 00:23:56,69
that

286
00:23:56,69 --> 00:24:02,57
a few maybe ten were but yes other than that
i might have been there and there might

287
00:24:02,57 --> 00:24:07,31
have been foreman boilermakers. And
foreman fitted into even the foreman

288
00:24:07,31 --> 00:24:10,51
boilermaker in the workshops was not
right. He came out and there is

289
00:24:10,51 --> 00:24:11,72
a scene. I brought

290
00:24:11,72 --> 00:24:14,94
a whole whole crew of i think it's about
twenty of them come out. That's right.

291
00:24:15,10 --> 00:24:19,53
Belfast together outright they weren't
brought out by drawing on there and then

292
00:24:19,53 --> 00:24:23,99
there was the martin as i was two brothers
they were in charge of the workshops.

293
00:24:24,01 --> 00:24:29,80
They were englishmen i think yeah english
which later doorman along itself was

294
00:24:29,80 --> 00:24:31,06
there was

295
00:24:31,06 --> 00:24:36,96
a firm from middlesbrough an england and
when you worked on the on the approach

296
00:24:36,96 --> 00:24:42,23
bands concreting on the approaches to the
public works concrete yeah. Was that was

297
00:24:42,23 --> 00:24:46,36
the work harder. Was there or yes
a bit harder feeling because feed

298
00:24:46,36 --> 00:24:51,86
a concrete mixer. We had to put so much
sand so much metal into the concrete mixer

299
00:24:51,86 --> 00:24:57,99
into the hopper and mix it up. It was
poured what was the form in the charger and

300
00:24:57,99 --> 00:25:04,66
like i was not mad. I don't know my
charlie leds and. He'd be dead and gone.

301
00:25:04,90 --> 00:25:09,41
I think i suppose to do with a small
machine is a small ranking which or about

302
00:25:09,41 --> 00:25:11,34
a yard i think held about

303
00:25:11,34 --> 00:25:18,17
a yard where they put their use put the
concrete into it to barrows or that they

304
00:25:19,04 --> 00:25:23,51
use huge chutes issues is they have skips.

305
00:25:25,86 --> 00:25:30,60
Did with you when you tipped to concrete
mixer straight up to shoot it. Yes i would

306
00:25:30,60 --> 00:25:31,82
say you know you came straight out of

307
00:25:31,82 --> 00:25:37,25
a shell yeah yeah. I make sure into the
field. So you move the mixer you make sure

308
00:25:37,25 --> 00:25:41,48
yeah where we have to pour you move you
know your concrete make sure yes and be

309
00:25:41,48 --> 00:25:47,46
able mobile. I understand. And the carpenters
were forming up right there and you

310
00:25:47,46 --> 00:25:51,35
say you have mix was on top of the formwork
was it. That's right yes. On top of the

311
00:25:51,35 --> 00:25:56,05
formwork and shoot straight down. Do you
member of the. Concrete packing in those

312
00:25:56,05 --> 00:26:02,29
days and anybody doing packing. Now i can't
remember you know the reinforcing they

313
00:26:02,30 --> 00:26:07,74
were different crew to last. Was it
really concrete steel. Yes i think it was

314
00:26:07,74 --> 00:26:11,20
around board concrete.
So it was for that with

315

334
00:27:41,44 --> 00:27:45,99
a band so i don't know what side because
it was more hilly on that or shady side

335
00:27:45,99 --> 00:27:49,89
whereas on our side was a
more or less a well quite

336
00:27:49,89 --> 00:27:56,59
a bit hilly but. Coming from like from that
time on us from the city kid you got to

337
00:27:56,59 --> 00:28:00,88
doorways point. While the doors pointed
to the old what they call it now.

338
00:28:01,97 --> 00:28:06,77
Observation park i think they call it now.
Observatory observatory that's right.

339
00:28:06,80 --> 00:28:13,79
Observatory hill and so you were up
near the nearly schoolgirl school. Yes

341
00:28:22,29 --> 00:28:23,92
and it was already pulled
down the other side

342
00:28:23,92 --> 00:28:29,55
a forgery by the time you got there. All
i know you know for street went on for

343
00:28:29,55 --> 00:28:35,09

out for street. I don't mean that i mean

344
00:28:35,09 --> 00:28:40,79

was on one side of the street and it was

347
00:28:49,06 --> 00:28:52,86
very much. There were some other things
on the other side and sides even you know

348
00:28:52,86 --> 00:28:54,55
but on the other side of the street was

349
00:28:54,55 --> 00:29:00,86

poured down the princes street that was

353
00:29:14,23 --> 00:29:19,08

down over there before it was pulled. I

down and i waited around the rocks there
