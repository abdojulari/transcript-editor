1
00:00:05,29 --> 00:00:06,59
Identification.

2
00:00:06,92 --> 00:00:11,75
It's station thirteen with faith banter and Karen

3
00:00:11,75 --> 00:00:16,17
and Craig recorded on Thursday the fourth of September one thousand nine hundred seven

4
00:00:16,17 --> 00:00:26,33
and the tapes are about to begin in another few seconds. So Carolyn looked at her mother.

5
00:00:26,69 --> 00:00:32,43
And said Mom I think you better get texting go back to the hotel. And this is what happened.

6
00:00:32,69 --> 00:00:50,39
So she put her mother into the text in the hotel. So they are in the party and Caroline and they are this. We said Oh.

7
00:00:55,92 --> 00:01:07,08
I fear experienced on that trip. The storm broke the boat was overloaded.

8
00:01:07,58 --> 00:01:17,72
It had far more people in it should have had plus and all the rocks which they take to the Ottomans and things

9
00:01:18,43 --> 00:01:30,84
but I was sitting there hanging on like grim. From eight o'clock until five o'clock in the morning just to steal.

10
00:01:31,41 --> 00:01:43,32
Otherwise I'd go overboard. And we were hanging onto each other's legs. And the women of course just.

11
00:01:43,34 --> 00:01:53,69
Most of them very big help to hold them. And the but they don't. And the captain happened to come from.

12
00:01:55,49 --> 00:02:04,68
He knew all about. And. We couldn't talk because you couldn't move except when I thought my hand held is no longer.

13
00:02:05,53 --> 00:02:13,8
And I couldn't because I would have went overboard on the floor and pulled myself along.

14
00:02:13,82 --> 00:02:37,12
To work with the toilet at the back of the sternest. And I pushed a little door open. It looked really. So I couldn't.

15
00:02:37,21 --> 00:02:58,58
How did you know. And she threw up. Sure. And at five o'clock in the morning we had.

16
00:02:59,97 --> 00:03:15,77
To be in for a car show which is one of them but my cabin. And what should happen. Is washed ashore.

17
00:03:16,32 --> 00:03:33,76
We pull into this little room and the next thing the boat. And fortunately on the tree. I think they call a peaceful.

18
00:03:33,78 --> 00:03:46,19
Young Irishman he was under on the boat and after the boat was stranded. We thought we were going to do.

19
00:03:46,34 --> 00:03:58,82
And he said look I know the mission. The Presbyterian. You know it's a better.

20
00:03:58,83 --> 00:04:06,77
And I think we should leave the back of it because the main got stuck into them. Here.

21
00:04:06,78 --> 00:04:08,48
The crew got stuck into the beer

22
00:04:08,48 --> 00:04:16,99
and Meredith who is with us had this magnificent long hair that you could sit on looking young woman nineteen

23
00:04:16,99 --> 00:04:33,25
or twenty or whatever and I kept looking at her and saying fuck fuck. So Tony and I think we're very good and. So.

24
00:04:33,27 --> 00:04:45,59
We took. We put our sleeping bags on my back and we set off and when it was as it were we climbed out.

25
00:04:45,61 --> 00:04:57,19
And finally we came to a cottage and mission. And it happened.

26
00:04:58,18 --> 00:05:05,79
Tony knew her because she had sheltered him on previous occasions. Lovely. She knew that we were coming.

27
00:05:06,31 --> 00:05:12,71
I think someone who'd run ahead. And she'd knocked off her chicken.

28
00:05:12,73 --> 00:05:20,17
And had cooked it in Ballard time we got there it was just ready to eat a woman of course you can imagine hadn't spoken

29
00:05:20,17 --> 00:05:35,4
to anyone from Australia for a long time and she couldn't stop talking and I was rocking. And she put us all down to.

30
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:45,55
Have to read the chicken and. Then Tony said he'd just heard word from them but someone had come.

31
00:05:45,99 --> 00:05:48,61
And said the tide would be.

32
00:05:49,39 --> 00:05:54,65
We must have been shipwrecked about midnight because this person came up

33
00:05:54,65 --> 00:06:00,28
and said the tide will be at five o'clock in the morning and if we're not on about the weather.

34
00:06:00,29 --> 00:06:13,5
Which I haven't was this one. Yes said the nursing sister.

35
00:06:13,51 --> 00:06:30,13
And we've actually ran to the bank because of being left on the. True enough leg but just ready to pull the anchor and.

36
00:06:30,14 --> 00:06:35,48
I had to go when the tide came in. Otherwise.

37
00:06:36,32 --> 00:06:42,43
So we got on the boat and the captain was able to talk to me he told me his name

38
00:06:42,43 --> 00:06:52,69
and that he would come from my father's village and that he had rowed. And said that we were coming.

39
00:06:53,87 --> 00:07:04,26
And I said thinking you know if this is work if this is what you get ready to give.

40
00:07:05,83 --> 00:07:16,46
Well that have to do with your rived. It was beautiful.

41
00:07:18,85 --> 00:07:25,62
And there on the beach was the whole village to welcome us and I was clapping and

42
00:07:25,62 --> 00:07:40,18
when we actually got to come this way to pass through the spirit of beautiful. And I took us up to the valley.

43
00:07:40,87 --> 00:07:54,35
They gave us some strong and I'd cleaned up the church in which they were going to. Mr Painter a moving moment for you.

44
00:07:55,48 --> 00:08:04,33
It was a very moving experience because I was actually in the village that had.

45
00:08:05,98 --> 00:08:15,52
When I was a child around the US and I never in my wildest dreams ever ever thought I would ever see this village.

46
00:08:16,63 --> 00:08:23,42
I don't know why but it never occurred to me. I mean if you went somewhere. You went off to the M.R.O.

47
00:08:23,42 --> 00:08:31,43
You know a lot of them know what have you in my head I'm pretty crazy leaving these beautiful islands behind them a

48
00:08:31,43 --> 00:08:43,07
country. Anyhow. We stayed. And then came back and pictures have one afternoon in the with a head cow.

49
00:08:44,54 --> 00:08:54,52
And we went back to the. But it wasn't before that they had given me a lot of information about my father's.

50
00:08:54,93 --> 00:08:56,58
They remembered my father.

51
00:08:57,05 --> 00:09:04,2
My father's family and then he said that they were his cousins and nieces and nephews and what have you.

52
00:09:04,37 --> 00:09:13,73
I doubt if this was bad it was nice to be able to identify with each other and.

53
00:09:13,75 --> 00:09:20,66
I've been looking at some of the photographs that were taken while there and I had my little type of code.

54
00:09:21,17 --> 00:09:27,69
And the kids lost like I would say sing for me and

55
00:09:27,7 --> 00:09:31,34
when I played it back they'd almost hop into the skin with excitement

56
00:09:32,37 --> 00:09:36,97
and there was one particular little girl I would say she would be about six.

57
00:09:37,74 --> 00:09:51,53
And she was very keen to press the button and I sit and watch. It. And she said.

58
00:09:51,54 --> 00:09:59,82
And then there was another person who said her name was. Telly.

59
00:09:59,83 --> 00:10:07,88
Now I have a sister who is second time as telly and she was named. After my father's mother.

60
00:10:07,9 --> 00:10:12,78
So I felt you know this is my bloody family for God's sake.

61
00:10:16,5 --> 00:10:23,23
Incidentally I moved just out of the church into the maternity clinic but they said if a pregnant woman comes in.

62
00:10:23,26 --> 00:10:30,79
It would have to go back to the church but in the clinic there were facilities or showers. And so forth.

63
00:10:32,74 --> 00:10:38,89
So we go up to the clinic and it's very nice apart from that we.

64
00:10:39,91 --> 00:10:51,00
And various groups of people would come in from the mountains and. That was me.

65
00:10:52,38 --> 00:10:55,93
And tell me some story about being related to me.

66
00:10:58,57 --> 00:11:09,97
One morning we get up and sitting outside is a six foot plus with quite. A group of women.

67
00:11:10,7 --> 00:11:21,57
Come in the morning with hot. Taro. Chicken or what have you. But there he was and he was nursing a rooster.

68
00:11:21,58 --> 00:11:37,67
And so when I go out. This doesn't belong here with the rooster. It was very moving.

69
00:11:40,56 --> 00:11:55,55
But I found that was the most important thing about. Any Have we went back to the hotel and Alan had left for.

70
00:11:55,57 --> 00:12:00,22
We came back to Sydney and that inspired me to write for.

71
00:12:08,1 --> 00:12:17,43
I didn't know I thought well the best thing to do is just put it. Put it. And I put it down.

72
00:12:19,25 --> 00:12:29,4
And do you know if I could really do that again. I've become perhaps too sophisticated to work there.

73
00:12:29,4 --> 00:12:33,04
I think if you play.

74
00:12:34,59 --> 00:12:48,26
It just quite spontaneously Wolf when you start to write every word of every word and every morning I get how to work.

75
00:12:48,28 --> 00:12:56,12
And at quarter past seven. I would be sitting down to right through the you know until about one o'clock.

76
00:12:56,13 --> 00:13:06,8
And then I'd go back to it and get up in time to get dinner. And I kept there for them up. And then I gave it to.

77
00:13:07,7 --> 00:13:23,55
Lovely person after Australia Council for governor second name. Doesn't matter. And.

78
00:13:27,13 --> 00:13:31,29
The publisher for it and I couldn't believe it when I got in the manuscript.

79
00:13:33,83 --> 00:13:36,1
He rang me up and asked me to have coffee with him.

80
00:13:36,25 --> 00:13:40,72
And he brought the manuscript back and he said Well it's really not a book.

81
00:13:41,71 --> 00:13:57,67
And I thought about that and I thought well it's a book with publishing. A manuscript. You know these are truly.

82
00:13:59,9 --> 00:14:13,57
Among the more younger writers. But it was. Very much between the writers. Anyhow. Nearly fell over all.

83
00:14:14,21 --> 00:14:21,65
Good good news. Well liked it was great and that was the beginning right.

84
00:14:22,26 --> 00:14:33,37
And the person who was handling it is now I'm not. And he said have you got a copy and I said Yes I hear.

85
00:14:35,01 --> 00:14:59,43
Do you really want that comma. Not touched. But yes. It came out of this couple of months later I have three.

86
00:14:59,94 --> 00:15:07,19
To tell him he has won an award. And later would come in the post.

87
00:15:12,25 --> 00:15:28,32
For this can't be true and sure enough it was talking so I went down to Melbourne for the celebration.

88
00:15:29,96 --> 00:15:50,11
I'd had quite a number off with radio and television and so forth. And that was the beginnings of my writing. Caroline.

89
00:15:50,13 --> 00:16:15,22
It's much harder to write now because the disciplined. I don't know what I want to kind of feel to let the.
