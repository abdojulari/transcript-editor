1
00:00:19,26 --> 00:00:41,76
Identification. This is tape two side two which will begin in approximately ten seconds time.

2
00:00:44,23 --> 00:00:53,72
One of the things of course that concerned. The family was there was no longer the income from but now.

3
00:00:54,53 --> 00:01:03,61
And none of my brothers wanted to be involved in that kind of thing. So we then began to wonder what we'd live on.

4
00:01:04,52 --> 00:01:12,53
Well at that time there was a thing that was called state aid which the local said Mother should apply for.

5
00:01:13,93 --> 00:01:30,42
And that gave her a pension of a car in and so much for each child under fourteen. And. It was sufficient.

6
00:01:30,82 --> 00:01:35,42
She made all our clothes. And then my sisters began to sew.

7
00:01:36,12 --> 00:01:43,31
So need to make it but not adequately associative but they were made.

8
00:01:43,39 --> 00:01:52,48
I mean there were times when the sole of my shoe coming off and I had want to stay because it would drag along.

9
00:01:52,5 --> 00:01:55,61
And she'd get the last hammer

10
00:01:55,61 --> 00:02:00,68
and put a tech in it to hold it back so I could go off to school things like that were happening.

11
00:02:02,12 --> 00:02:11,26
But she wanted to work so she went to. One of the local hotels.

12
00:02:11,28 --> 00:02:17,63
And there were these two hotels one in the south of Tampa Holcomb the other in the north.

13
00:02:19,53 --> 00:02:28,37
And the one in the north was the one which we knew best because they had boys who were around about the same age as my

14
00:02:28,37 --> 00:02:34,87
brothers and I went to school together. And their names were Perkins.

15
00:02:36,83 --> 00:02:44,86
And there was a great attraction here for for my brother. Walter because they had a stable of horses.

16
00:02:44,88 --> 00:02:52,13
But mother went along and she saw the daughter of the publican because the daughter managed this.

17
00:02:52,15 --> 00:03:01,82
Power Of course made of timber upstairs and downstairs. And I had a big barn of her and typical country.

18
00:03:03,16 --> 00:03:12,99
It was just lovely to see a building that had a second floor. Only the pumps have the second floor.

19
00:03:13,01 --> 00:03:22,45
So mother went to we the daughter of the publican. And we need said Would you like some work and mother said yes.

20
00:03:23,67 --> 00:03:33,07
So he went to the pub twice a week. And she did the laundry for Winnie and father.

21
00:03:33,95 --> 00:03:43,82
I think there were a couple of brothers and she did the awning. And she absolutely loved it. We need more of my mother.

22
00:03:44,15 --> 00:03:54,4
And I always ended the day by going into the ladies' power. And and having a drink. Just so lovely.

23
00:03:54,64 --> 00:04:04,16
Then she'd always give Mother things to bring bottles of lemonade a couple of bottles of lemonade or ginger beer

24
00:04:04,16 --> 00:04:21,01
or something like that for the kids and mother would come home about. My very thickly law where. Bush scrapped.

25
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:33,31
And it also had a local to Belgium symmetry. Which by their had clothes. It was quite a.

26
00:04:33,33 --> 00:04:40,43
But the cemetery always festa dated as we often visited the cemetery and was also.

27
00:04:40,45 --> 00:04:48,9
When did you know and there is usually most of you know it was nice we often went to. GRACE.

28
00:04:48,98 --> 00:04:55,51
I think that symmetries do tell me his story. Anyhow.

29
00:04:55,52 --> 00:05:00,68
I'm fascinated by cemeteries even to this day but I'll never forget that symmetry

30
00:05:01,6 --> 00:05:07,41
and the tombstones were just so beautiful and I suppose they were all in erected

31
00:05:08,52 --> 00:05:13,4
and those people who were very there in the last century in the nineteenth century. Anyhow.

32
00:05:13,79 --> 00:05:23,87
Mother would come home quite tired but placement late. And there was a dinner all cooked ready for her.

33
00:05:24,05 --> 00:05:28,16
You see John would be forking during the day but he also for the farmers

34
00:05:28,16 --> 00:05:33,05
but he always got home in time to prepare the meal. Can I just ask.

35
00:05:33,33 --> 00:05:41,5
The boys went and got jobs another that it had not happened and what was their sadness that your fun wasn't continuing.

36
00:05:43,94 --> 00:05:50,92
The boys didn't want to continue with father's farm because they just didn't want to work.

37
00:05:50,94 --> 00:05:53,55
They wanted to work with was bigger money.

38
00:05:54,07 --> 00:06:02,6
So they cut came during the cane season four of them in fact was very young people

39
00:06:03,33 --> 00:06:11,64
and John was sort of managing a dairy. He went off very early in the morning and he'd come home.

40
00:06:11,85 --> 00:06:17,63
About half past four in the afternoon always making sure he was in time to cook the meal. So.

41
00:06:18,21 --> 00:06:26,53
And it was like this with my other brothers. You know we had each other we had each other.

42
00:06:27,42 --> 00:06:31,3
That was important that that vacuum that had been created.

43
00:06:32,71 --> 00:06:40,12
Was indeed quite deep quite deep and he was a very strict person my father

44
00:06:40,12 --> 00:06:47,55
and I think to some extent the bowl use We're rather pleased to enjoy the new found freedom wouldn't dispute that at

45
00:06:47,55 --> 00:06:54,7
all but when he went to certain. Left it left an emptiness.

46
00:06:54,89 --> 00:07:03,01
Well mother would come home and all she would have to do sit have a dinner. And.

47
00:07:03,02 --> 00:07:09,56
She'd cry sometimes you just cry that she'd lost my father and when mother would sit there and cry.

48
00:07:09,59 --> 00:07:22,89
It would just rip my heart into and after she'd cry. She'd sing. And we got used to this over the years.

49
00:07:23,02 --> 00:07:25,76
She cried for my father for years and years

50
00:07:25,76 --> 00:07:33,44
and years after his death so that was going back to the old house that involve him.

51
00:07:33,46 --> 00:07:41,94
Mother was beginning to feel lonely. Lot as many people kind of that father had car.

52
00:07:42,49 --> 00:07:52,42
And although she had the neighbors. She liked the company and ship also with the island women.

53
00:07:53,99 --> 00:08:02,44
And one day she came home from work. She got more work. Apart from the hotel. She got to work in other places as well.

54
00:08:02,71 --> 00:08:12,19
So I know how she mounted been earning about a pound a week or so which was very big money. I thought she had.

55
00:08:12,62 --> 00:08:22,45
Sovereign. Anyhow. She came home one day and she said we're going to leave this house now.

56
00:08:25,07 --> 00:08:30,31
And we all gathered around her and asked her where we were going and what.

57
00:08:30,79 --> 00:08:36,48
Well that day she'd actually been up to Mobile and. For some reason or other.

58
00:08:37,01 --> 00:08:44,54
And made inquiries about a certain house which she knew was becoming vacant and it was then vacant.

59
00:08:45,16 --> 00:08:56,32
And it was possible for us to move into this house which was about a ten minute walk away from where I lived.

60
00:08:57,99 --> 00:09:09,51
And from also it was next door to where. As a daughter of hers who force a step daughter lived.

61
00:09:10,48 --> 00:09:19,69
With her husband children whom we didn't really know. They were just completely separate.

62
00:09:19,71 --> 00:09:24,06
With these the daughters of early marriage. Yes yes.

63
00:09:24,56 --> 00:09:32,85
So it was being close it was having relations who were close that she needed. So she said. So next week.

64
00:09:33,22 --> 00:09:39,12
You have to pack up helping to pack up. So we all got stuck into packing up.

65
00:09:39,77 --> 00:09:48,17
And the neighbors for whom work for said you don't have to get a carrier.

66
00:09:48,63 --> 00:09:54,74
Mrs massing out take all your things and he had huge way.

67
00:09:54,76 --> 00:09:59,00
So he loaded up the way put his good horses into it

68
00:09:59,71 --> 00:10:05,35
and off with all our belongings up to the other house which we always call the new.

69
00:10:06,24 --> 00:10:11,44
And it was nice because it was on a very high start.

70
00:10:12,97 --> 00:10:23,57
And we could play downstate as it was like having a huge cubby house in a way down. Yes and it had mo bedroom.

71
00:10:24,49 --> 00:10:33,43
Yeah it was different but it didn't have the so that the old house the balcony.

72
00:10:34,22 --> 00:10:40,45
Did you feel that as a little girl you know why I missed.

73
00:10:40,48 --> 00:10:45,48
I missed the outside opened fire kitchen which was my father's

74
00:10:46,81 --> 00:10:52,8
and there was no way to sit around tell stories as it were you know and the floors were polished.

75
00:10:53,69 --> 00:10:58,97
And the verandah was scrubbed and all that kind of thing. So but.

76
00:10:59,52 --> 00:11:06,37
None of the boys came with us because by then they'd gone off and I was living with different farmers

77
00:11:07,36 --> 00:11:12,76
but mother knew all those families and they knew she was quite happy about the boys.

78
00:11:12,78 --> 00:11:21,94
And some of the families continue to send the boys to school like that. And help with the milking or whatever it was.

79
00:11:23,89 --> 00:11:25,97
When the boys left home

80
00:11:25,97 --> 00:11:32,51
and you were in the new house did that change things to do to girls then take on different roles.

81
00:11:32,6 --> 00:11:43,07
Did they do more if they had duties. When we moved house of course it meant losing and although he came and went.

82
00:11:43,42 --> 00:12:00,03
It wasn't. So. But I have to tell you this first. That father died and the year was nineteen twenty four.

83
00:12:00,04 --> 00:12:08,00
And at nineteen twenty six. My auntie Kate. So when we moved to move.

84
00:12:09,76 --> 00:12:16,88
Shortly after that she died which was a terrible blow a dreadful blow because we'd lost really.

85
00:12:17,93 --> 00:12:30,9
All the support that the boys would give that night. To us and we'd moved up there to be mainly near Kate and Kate and.

86
00:12:32,2 --> 00:12:41,8
So all of this was quite dramatic a matter of fact for not only mother but we kids felt it as well. Now.

87
00:12:41,89 --> 00:12:46,25
Mamma had to turn around. Oh by the way in the government.

88
00:12:46,32 --> 00:12:49,47
I had introduced what was known as the we don't pay attention

89
00:12:50,29 --> 00:12:53,53
and that was far more substantial A mother didn't have to work any more.

90
00:12:55,00 --> 00:13:00,76
But the house had fruit trees and then we could help ourselves to ankle chalice fruit and vegetables

91
00:13:00,76 --> 00:13:11,46
and you know it was true. There were all the yams where you wanted the pineapples and everything which.

92
00:13:11,48 --> 00:13:17,19
Well I mean we could live out of it. So. It wasn't a financial blow.

93
00:13:17,88 --> 00:13:24,79
And certainly it gave us the chance to go to school which was of course a better school.

94
00:13:25,76 --> 00:13:35,53
You know why the other school at to Malcolm. But it was good for us to be in a bigger.

95
00:13:35,54 --> 00:13:49,8
And we would tune from school in this new house. Now when I am Kate. Mather took a very different role.

96
00:13:50,86 --> 00:14:01,79
She didn't have to go to work as I say. And she became very much more of a mother and housekeeper.

97
00:14:02,54 --> 00:14:11,34
And she had a little sewing room in the new house that she'd like to so she then began to cook just as John had cooked

98
00:14:11,34 --> 00:14:20,73
which amazed us all and we need to say I was cooking you know. But the girl didn't help that much.

99
00:14:21,03 --> 00:14:25,07
None of them helped awfully much they wanted to offer a supporter for mamma.

100
00:14:26,92 --> 00:14:38,32
Not all those two step sisters who were very supportive. But you know we bought Cortef with the kids around the place.

101
00:14:38,34 --> 00:14:43,76
And mother was just there. So we should cook the same evening meal.

102
00:14:43,77 --> 00:14:49,56
And she would mail for Uncle Charlie and walk across the paddock to his place

103
00:14:50,34 --> 00:14:56,35
and put down hot enough for him seven nights a week because ninety cases.

104
00:14:56,37 --> 00:15:04,73
And then she'd come back and get a round table to have AM and now. This house.

105
00:15:06,76 --> 00:15:11,62
We were paying I think mother paid six shillings a week in rain.

106
00:15:12,63 --> 00:15:19,8
And the landlord would come and collect her in once a fortnight. He was a very big deal and.

107
00:15:19,82 --> 00:15:27,4
That he'd lived in a hotel a bachelor who lived in a. And he would come out his horse for the rain.

108
00:15:27,42 --> 00:15:34,68
And he'd call out to you. They Mrs mussing and mother used to go out and you know.

109
00:15:35,41 --> 00:15:41,07
She'd hand him up the reins while he sat on the horse needs right a receipt out and hand it to her

110
00:15:41,91 --> 00:15:55,55
and made sure that he returned a little bit so we stayed. Perhaps and Kate had been about four.

111
00:15:56,87 --> 00:16:03,51
And Uncle Charlie said look I think or you can be a mother or your girls better come and live in the house.

112
00:16:03,53 --> 00:16:07,19
So he built himself a kind of lean to which was.

113
00:16:07,6 --> 00:16:19,96
He was going to live in and he just moved his belongings out and we moved into Katie's house. Now. And we truly did.

114
00:16:21,38 --> 00:16:28,7
Remove the lavatory. And it almost seemed to me as it was a half a mile away from the house.

115
00:16:28,72 --> 00:16:39,62
It wasn't really but I would think it would have been. Hundred meters or much more.

116
00:16:41,57 --> 00:16:49,21
And it was down a little hill as it were from. On one side or lemon trees and on the other side bar and tree.

117
00:16:49,68 --> 00:17:02,97
And you walked down this avenue of tree. To get to it and they are this level tree and it was.

118
00:17:03,82 --> 00:17:08,39
A real reading room and sometimes you know

119
00:17:08,39 --> 00:17:13,07
when someone would go there someone else stand at the top of that you have haven't you.

120
00:17:13,09 --> 00:17:22,52
And roll an orange down to hit their feet. Then the worst of what we call not alone.

121
00:17:22,77 --> 00:17:26,65
The wash house and that was another lane.

122
00:17:26,67 --> 00:17:34,9
So there when you went to the lavatory you had to take your clothes off and put a Galatea

123
00:17:34,9 --> 00:17:47,22
or sort of overall it was similar to theater garments where you just put your arms in and tied at the back

124
00:17:47,98 --> 00:17:55,54
and say You wore that down to the lever tree. And you came back and you took it out of your hand up and.

125
00:17:55,56 --> 00:18:02,87
And there was a cabal except lifeforce a big scrubbing brush and you had to have a scrub.

126
00:18:02,89 --> 00:18:08,62
And they did get dressed again. So this would all of a to.

127
00:18:09,9 --> 00:18:17,7
Well I have very tender memories of being at that house because in many ways. Uncle Charlie became a father.

128
00:18:18,84 --> 00:18:33,3
And he was very highly regarded people knew. And particularly the farmers to him. And he saved a lot of money too.

129
00:18:33,33 --> 00:18:44,26
He had a fair bit socked away. He and Kate had never married. His They did actually. You mean legally.

130
00:18:44,27 --> 00:18:46,45
Also I thought they were brother and sister.

131
00:18:47,73 --> 00:18:53,39
Well that's what I forgot I should have explained this when I first got together they told if you

132
00:18:53,39 --> 00:18:55,79
and I were preferences.

133
00:18:57,3 --> 00:19:04,28
Where it was found that they weren't and I made people believe that but later when they were built a house

134
00:19:04,28 --> 00:19:12,88
and lived together and I said we're not. So which one was related to your Uncle Charlie was a genuine brother.

135
00:19:13,04 --> 00:19:22,21
Yes And Kate only came from the same man and but she really wasn't a sister. So.

136
00:19:22,23 --> 00:19:33,44
I mean it was a man and wife arrangement really it was once a house was built and I settled in. Anyhow. Uncle Charlie.

137
00:19:33,46 --> 00:19:34,38
Of course one.

138
00:19:36,18 --> 00:19:43,38
We lived he had healings which for five years that he put on to fruit

139
00:19:43,38 --> 00:19:47,92
and vegetable from people by the name of B R I was I.

140
00:19:48,13 --> 00:19:57,47
They were very early settlers on the trade among some of the first and it was the second generation.

141
00:19:57,49 --> 00:20:06,21
That was there when we were there and there were three Miss Bray and the elderly mother lived.

142
00:20:06,98 --> 00:20:14,05
None of them had married and they had a marvelous old house made up see these days you just build one house

143
00:20:14,05 --> 00:20:17,88
and you live in it. But those days in the country that offer.

144
00:20:17,93 --> 00:20:24,07
Built two three different houses little smaller ones that made up a into a big house.

145
00:20:24,08 --> 00:20:32,76
And they had a cluster of small houses and I think it keeps the peace in the family because if you get angry.

146
00:20:33,4 --> 00:20:36,02
Lock yourself up away from the rest.

147
00:20:36,03 --> 00:20:45,91
Well that's where the brace lived and I own the land which he paid six pounds a year or less. For police.

148
00:20:46,8 --> 00:20:53,46
And they came by so often just to visit these three unmarried women.

149
00:20:53,9 --> 00:21:10,42
And he used to look after their place and keep it tidy do all kinds of form. And. When I when I would come home.

150
00:21:11,22 --> 00:21:23,67
And homemade biscuits. It was like Santa Claus. Well. Charlie took charge of us. And we honored him.

151
00:21:24,91 --> 00:21:33,53
We respected really honored him. And. He had an eye for value.

152
00:21:33,55 --> 00:21:43,01
So when it was time to make a fresh lot of new dresses he'd take us into town not Martha take the four of us into town.

153
00:21:43,35 --> 00:21:48,9
And there was a drapery shop they about the name of Proudfoot.

154
00:21:48,92 --> 00:21:53,96
And they knew our Proudfoot knew him and his prayer for him and

155
00:21:53,96 --> 00:21:59,3
when he'd go in they'd pull up one of those high chairs and all us kids would gather.

156
00:21:59,32 --> 00:22:03,72
And he'd say don't now you tell Mrs proud for what you are.

157
00:22:04,79 --> 00:22:11,04
And would also like the color of the cloth we'd want for a trace. And he would take afraid.

158
00:22:11,57 --> 00:22:22,74
Out of it just thread and break it to see how strong it was. To see had Europe all and he not. Something most strong.

159
00:22:23,02 --> 00:22:28,19
And she'd bring something else and the real thing. Stays first and future.

160
00:22:29,5 --> 00:22:35,66
Of course absolutely beautiful and more often than not. He'd settle on something like that and for the winter.

161
00:22:36,21 --> 00:22:50,84
He'd settle on surge. You know creeps in the Navy. So. Well you know it forces that for he he came after.

162
00:22:52,93 --> 00:22:55,53
And he said at the head of the table.

163
00:22:55,55 --> 00:23:03,08
And he continued telling the stories we're almost as it were where my father left off

164
00:23:04,02 --> 00:23:09,41
and he had to leave too with an i Phone five price because my auntie Kate wouldn't have him in the kitchen. You see.

165
00:23:10,06 --> 00:23:15,71
And it was as though we were having experienced we were having that experience again.

166
00:23:16,31 --> 00:23:23,87
Sitting around the fire listening to the stories and just as my father would get up to end it all he'd make the coke.

167
00:23:25,32 --> 00:23:32,32
Charlie would do the same thing he'd just get up and reach the big black kettle Mexico and head.

168
00:23:32,54 --> 00:23:39,8
And that meant we had to go to bed. So there was a lot of security there with my Uncle Charlie.

169
00:23:40,33 --> 00:23:46,53
I realize that more today believe it or not. He filled that gap in a very positive.

170
00:23:47,66 --> 00:23:55,01
Though the nature of each other this. Anyhow.

171
00:23:55,03 --> 00:24:01,58
Kind of course you see I went to school I went with went to more than bar I just took it in my stride

172
00:24:02,44 --> 00:24:11,78
but can take are still in kindergarten for a while. And I had had a teacher.

173
00:24:12,38 --> 00:24:17,87
And I used to think if I could play like play the piano and had.

174
00:24:17,93 --> 00:24:28,01
Mors Miss Fairfax and she also would let us dance but it wasn't the same as Miss Gracie not at all.

175
00:24:28,28 --> 00:24:44,53
So there was Jessie. Cat and myself going to school together. So there was that companionship. Did you like school.

176
00:24:44,55 --> 00:24:52,87
I can't say that I did particularly I liked it as I grew older I thought it was more interesting.

177
00:24:54,1 --> 00:25:02,02
And what I was better able to read grown up spokes I found I liked it better.

178
00:25:03,17 --> 00:25:12,66
I have to confess that I had some wonderful school teachers just marvelous school teachers who really took care of me.

179
00:25:13,76 --> 00:25:19,57
You know being the only black kid in a class. It was a pretty lonely life.

180
00:25:20,38 --> 00:25:27,97
And very often I have my sandwich or whatever I had for lunch with the teacher.

181
00:25:27,99 --> 00:25:38,00
And I recall that when I was in the last year in primary. We had a beautiful headmaster they were in.

182
00:25:38,94 --> 00:25:47,04
And sometimes he did me go into his office and had my sandwich well.

183
00:25:47,84 --> 00:25:57,99
And when I finished primary school school was a real challenge. And having to wear a uniform without any choice.

184
00:25:59,29 --> 00:26:04,71
So the last day at primary school I went into the principal's office.

185
00:26:05,44 --> 00:26:11,61
And I had saved my lunch money every Monday we got lunch money

186
00:26:12,32 --> 00:26:19,49
and one day one Monday I went with their lunch so I could to mandates so I could hang on to the. And I bought him.

187
00:26:20,09 --> 00:26:29,67
This was in the depths of the Depression. And I bought him. For a price and.

188
00:26:31,53 --> 00:26:38,17
I went back and I remember knocking on his door and he called out coming in. And I went in.

189
00:26:40,55 --> 00:26:51,41
And I handed him shyly I handed him this. And I looked in his eyes and full of tears. I've never forget that.

190
00:26:53,7 --> 00:27:06,3
So he told me sit down and I just sat there and I found it just to leave him such a beautiful person.

191
00:27:07,55 --> 00:27:19,21
So I went after SCO. And it was so eventful. I couldn't take an interest.

192
00:27:19,23 --> 00:27:30,29
I was not to stay at school but I stayed until I was just on sixty. And I couldn't get away quickly.

193
00:27:30,31 --> 00:27:37,08
Because there were other things opening up if I wanted to read not all I wanted to if it is there was a school library.

194
00:27:37,76 --> 00:27:45,25
Why should I have to depend on the school library. And I had ambitions. And I wanted to.

195
00:27:47,67 --> 00:27:56,4
And I don't look at the primary school of domestic science and I can say that I found it boring I found it intriguing.

196
00:27:57,08 --> 00:28:02,8
You know to learn how to grill or chop properly.

197
00:28:02,82 --> 00:28:11,58
My scarves and all those things and that was rather looked down upon at the time but I can tell you it's stuck with me.

198
00:28:12,93 --> 00:28:22,05
It didn't. Tell me about the School of Library. School of Arts had there.

199
00:28:22,81 --> 00:28:29,88
I had a hall and in the hall was a good stage.

200
00:28:30,2 --> 00:28:38,39
I was very accustomed to that stage in fact because while still in the primary school I was in the choir.

201
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:41,68
And we did a lot of Shakespeare.

202
00:28:42,29 --> 00:28:49,77
And we would go down and we were allowed to use the hall and put on a Shakespearean play.

203
00:28:49,79 --> 00:28:52,98
And the local mothers would go and watch it.

204
00:28:53,1 --> 00:29:04,87
So I had had I do I was familiar with the stage and we were told how to walk onto a stage and. Do things properly.

205
00:29:04,89 --> 00:29:17,43
And then there was also a competition for singing a state for the local the state fund

206
00:29:17,43 --> 00:29:21,33
and it was always a public school Catholic school

207
00:29:21,33 --> 00:29:26,27
and they would always leave us for dead because the nuns would put their all into it

208
00:29:26,27 --> 00:29:30,26
and we had nobody except this lovely principal who would take us through.

209
00:29:32,93 --> 00:29:45,07
Music lessons but I loved school because of what it offered me in the way music but as far as the school was concerned.

210
00:29:46,65 --> 00:29:54,74
Any book I wanted was there and I would get through two or three books in a week without any trouble.

211
00:29:54,76 --> 00:30:07,74
And they don't begin to think. After writing novels. I'd like to write. Real wishy washy love novels.

212
00:30:08,08 --> 00:30:17,62
You know about people falling in love. Going off to bed together and getting into flash cars and driving around and.

213
00:30:17,93 --> 00:30:21,64
Wearing beautiful clothes and going out to nightclubs

214
00:30:22,98 --> 00:30:31,64
and I had these dreams that one day I would be writing about people like that. Wow.

215
00:30:31,66 --> 00:30:44,51
It didn't quite turn out that way but I had many day dream. And I craved marrying a rich man.

216
00:30:44,52 --> 00:30:59,92
And that he bought me a nice big car. And these were almost you know. That the house meant a lot.

217
00:31:00,2 --> 00:31:11,6
It was nice to go home from school and in the evening once again with my uncle Charlie mother and the other kids.

218
00:31:12,69 --> 00:31:22,46
There it gave me a great feeling of security. I know. There that house and that garden.

219
00:31:22,48 --> 00:31:36,75
And my mother and culture gave me tremendous security. I felt I could go out and face the world. Anywhere at any time.
