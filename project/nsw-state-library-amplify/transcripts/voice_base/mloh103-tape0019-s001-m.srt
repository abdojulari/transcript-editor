00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's Friday 4th December 1992 and we're on Nmbngee. How do you spell Nmbngee? N-m-b-n-g-e-e. Speaking to Bob... Bob Tissott. Spell that. T-i-s-s-o-t-t.  Well I first came here... sorry.  My name is Bob.
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Tissott and I first came to Nimbin about six weeks before the Aquarius festival, with two close friends.
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And we were coming up to help get the site organized.
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And we were driven by the idea that the Incredible String Band were going to be playing which they never did.
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For the six weeks prior to the festival
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My job was working in the Rainbow cafe which was cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner for the workers. If you're a worker,
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Putting together the site you were paid one Nimbuck per day and one Nimbuck
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Was enough to buy you breakfast, lunch and dinner.
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Which usually consisted of porridge for breakfast and fried vegetables for dinner, lots of veggies
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and rice. It was a very macrobiotic time. At this same time I unfortunately
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
was apprehended for the cultivation of marijuana.
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Which resulted in all the other people who were working on the festival site putting on a benefit concert
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to try to rise the bail so that I could get out of gaol. We had to spend the week in the Lismore lockup waiting for the
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
magistrate because they only had court one day a week.
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And we got busted on the same day they had court so we had to wait till the following week to get to see him.
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They had a wonderful benefit dance. They made no money but everybody had a wonderful time. Yes. So after that
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I went to sydney for a few months following that to earn the money to cover the bail that a friend had paid.
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And then came back up and rented another farmhouse over on Stoney Chute Road. Where I lived for, I suppose six months. With
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
maybe six other people in the big old house. At that time. Nmbngee had been
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Purchased by the original group of people who, ah, got it together. And there was still 
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Shares for sale so i promptly went back off to sydney to work to earn enough money to buy a share.
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Which i did, and arrived back up here in May 1977. My memories of the festival.
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think my strongest memory of the festival was the visual impression of it. When you looked
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
From the main street of nimbin. Down into the paddocks that are behind the hotel and it looked like me.
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Camped out for the night in some medieval battle. There were hundreds of little camp fires everywhere.
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There was mist. It was in the middle of winter. Heavy mist.
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you could just see the glows of the fires in the smoke in the mist combined so that you.
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When you're actually in the site area, in the camping area of an evening.
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You couldn't see more than fifteen - twenty feet in front of you.
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Which was really rather exciting when you're walking around you sort of bump into all these rather interesting and.
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Amazing people. I remember the the public access stage. In particular  in terms of.
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you wanted to get on stage
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and do something in front of a whole lot of other people you just had to write your name down on the schedule.
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:38,000
On a blank spot, and there was lots of, I don't know, people music as well. A lot of rhythm. A lot of drumming. People.
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
On bongos and logs and anything you could shake. I mean it still goes on today. I was in town
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
only yesterday and the african dance group had the whole of town just thumping with this constant rhythm, it was wonderful.
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A lot of religious groups at the festival. I mean the Krishnas were perhaps the most visible.
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They had a really large marquee. But there were maybe half a dozen different religious organizations set up their tents and 
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:21,000
plied their spiritual trades. The Hari tent? Well. There was a free feast every lunch time. If you were hungry.
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Very much into their whites. Sugar sweets lots of. Very sweet food. like their sugar. But anyway.
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you were hungry you could go along there, always get a meal. They had a twenty-four hour chanting session
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
on Buddha's birthday which was on the full moon in Taurus. It was
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
a celebration of the birthday of Buddha and they chanted from midnight to midnight. Without cease. There was always somebody working at it.
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And a lot of people during that twenty-four hours would go and join in and chant for perhaps an hour.
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and work themselves into a frenzy, get hungry and mozie off somewhere else. I think for a lot of people through the.
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
One of the great things they had to come to grips with was the toilet situation.
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Which was a circle of hessian, perhaps four four foot high. They had a whole circle inside of it of dunnies.
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And when you went in and you sat on a dunny you were facing perhaps seven
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
or eight other people who were also sitting on their dunnies.
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And you could smile
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and you could chat over the little petition between your dunny and the next dunny. It was quite a social place overall,
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the dunny's.
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Not quite as social as the saunas of course which were very social, very social.
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And there were two saunas; there was one that was built out of corrugated on and a few
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
people got burned bums in that one because it used to get really crowded
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and people would just pack in there with all these sweaty naked bodies everywhere.
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And the other one was built over a creek.
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And you could jump through a hole in the floor into the creek when you were hot enough. A lot of street activity.
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
All the time. A lot of the shops at that time in Nimbin were unused. Just empty shops.
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But during the festival all these people came out of the woodwork and set up things like a banana fritter
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
shop in just empty shop fronts and things like that. A lot of street theater. Especially in the evening.
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Most evenings there was street theater happening. And then of course there was the great drama of the bust, when
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When the police arrested somebody. Couple people i think that was down in the. Camping area.
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Supposedly for one position. But by the time they got them from the camps or.
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Up to the street with a paddy wagon was there must have been at least three hundred people had surrounded the paddy
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
wagon. The handcuffs were actually cut off with bolt cutters and the goa sky and a policeman had his gun stolen.
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now the result of the gun being stolen was that the next morning there would have been perhaps fifty. Down all.
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Very heavy very serious and want to know where the gun was and.
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Apparently it was returned i don't know who turned it over who'd even taken it but it was.
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It was returned and even the escapade he returned as well. With a lawyer boy saw it and everything.
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Come down considerably after that. What else was. All i was actually living. About ten kilometers. Out of town.
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
At the time was to travel in early every morning light up. Open up the kitchen and get the. Porridge hot.
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Things like to get the porridge out renting a farmhouse. Far dollars a week. I think or pine and.
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
When we arrived we had about eighty dollars to and i'm so we immediately. Spent fifty on advance rent.
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This and make sure that we wouldn't run out of that it was just to get. Sorry. What brought me to the festival.
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Was i desire to get out into the country. It had been. I suppose part of the alternative thoughts.
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
At that time that the end result was to leave the city to get back to ny to go to the country to grow your own
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
vegetables to build your own house. Just to do it you know.
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And i had tried once before very briefly in kangaroo valley and that had been a complete failure.
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Scuttled back to sydney. After only a few weeks of there. Wondering how i'd cope with leeches in the future.
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And this was just. This was.
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was just to be in the area i'd lived at mullumbimby for a wall
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and there's a lot of people coming out in him than i'm a kind of an imminent. Lot of talk of.
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's settle here and things like that which is pretty much what i did eventually.
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes i think that will mean that it was.
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It was just to be at the gathering of the clans it felt like all of your brothers and sisters were coming along and.
00:10:37,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That was where you should be nimby n.g.'s well. I don't know what name binjie means i'm sorry in the earth spirit.
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know off the word name down. And the name being i've heard a lot of the cars and. Explanations for the nine.
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:23,000
At the time of the festival. The providing thought was that a name than was like an aboriginal. Wise man a holy man.
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And it's a spirit. Or sorts as well. Apparently the area wasn't was never actually lived in.
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Bar the reason i came here for the the men and the boys came here for and purposes or for religious ceremonies.
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And then they went back to wherever i lived i think they probably live close to the coast where there was more fishing.
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because that the bundjalung people who were the productive dominant drive of the area were very much into their fishing.
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Coastal by strong. I mean they started at the bundjalung when the. All grandmother and her sons.
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Arrived at the beach at. Evans head there and. I think grandmother.
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
One of her sons fell asleep in the eye and the other ones.
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Went off looking for food somewhere else and dawud and i camped there on the hill. At evan's hidden started off.
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So what exactly it means i'm not sure.
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Except that it probably has a lot to do with with something reasonably cycloid to every ginny's the nine itself an
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:49,000
injury was spilt like that. I suspect. Just to give people a lot of trouble in zion. The property. Was bored.
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Probably about six months after the festival probably took that long to get enough people together with enough finance.
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
To purchase it i think it was found before that there was quite a land depression and probably it was a silent
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and a to mine for syle. For quite some time.
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The ardea of this particular property and borrowing it and getting a community.
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Happening here it was the brainchild of mangal braugher and joyce and the woman who was luminous through line.
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And brian. Came out looked at the price. Took one look at and said yes this is the place for me.
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And gathered together as many friends and friends of friends and. It was bought. I wasn't one of the original.
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Forty six people i came in probably at number four you know on. Thing. When a couple of other people had sold out and.
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well it's hard as i'll.
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Braun's are those i've done i've drawn dollar deals coincided with everybody else others i probably didn't because he's
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:17,000
gone. But his concept was a community of people that live together very closely. A lot of. Close. Intense.
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Into personal reactions very much the encounter group thought situation you know. You're feeling she to use i.
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You give me the shits that i just why you're looking. Whatever. It's not for wall be very difficult why to leave.
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Permanently and i think he felt that that was our deals have been sacrificed.
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
To other more pressing things like shelter. And water and the people was spreading people building houses.
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Separated a wife from the community hassen. Went being seen the dies at a time and things like that.
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He never bothered with the house he just moved into the old the area that was here.
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And lived there and wasn't interested in anything agricultural law. Or other wars.
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He was definitely a people person and. He went back to the city and. Started a circus.
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:29,000
In terms of water in what i read. Originally were sharing everything. Originally. All food was bought.
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Just as a big bulk shop. The a community house there was a large pantries now the office. Funny how things change.
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Where the falling cabinet is now there used to be big. Bins full of grinds and.
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There was an attitude then of trying to be agricultural self-sufficient. That's never really have enjoyed it.
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The soils not growing.
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And the people who were coming live here weren't really destined to be farmers advancing with one of them a very people
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
oriented as will.
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because social interactions always been a very large part of this community aspect of most communities too
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
when you're living in sharing a lot of the. Bill these are people. It industry them and talk to them. Whatever.
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:39,000
For them. It's been a very very sort of organic process. Once again primarily to do with.
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Who was here at any given time and. The top of person they were with a dominant top or personality who had very strong.
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Or ideas and attitudes and they want to do particular things. Mother divided you know.
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think if you've got people that are very motivated to do a particular thing
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and can express their ideas well then the other people who perhaps on some out of out of can think well that's the
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:13,000
that's a good way to go to strike that mine and mine only one of the big things is everyone. Building houses.
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Obviously getting. Individual shelter. Situation especially as more and more people start having families and.
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
When the people first bought the property. There was no children involved. One of the shareholders was pregnant and.
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
She had her child he wanted probably up in the community. And since then there's been i think.
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Fifteen children born in the probably year as people tended to have families perhaps.
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Break up into more traditional nuclear family situations like built himself. Nuclear family storehouses.
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In various spots around the property there's no one as yet has actually sort of built a group. Top of living situation.
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I've gotten a number of.
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
For example single people building a place together and and sharing in our person want to see more of that. But.
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well i haven't got the war from the two children. Everything. According to the statistics. One dog. Yes.
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It has it has because it has been a bush experience of the nuclear family but not totally.
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Has it been a bush experience of the nuclear family in some respects yes it has. I mean i've got a house.
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And we've got a vegie garden next to the house. But there's a large community.
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Vegetable garden happening as well that a lot of the.
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Single people who are here what has been a bit of a population shift. Of light. A number of the.
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
All the people have all the shareholders.
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But with more regional shareholders perhaps only regional shareholder rather than all that will put me down.
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I just like that. Have moved to lose more education actually had a lot to do with that. There's no final.
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He is living on twelve in that the nearest hospitals if you've got children that are going on to year eleven
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and twelve is in lismore it's obviously a damn sight easier to go to hospital is more he living in his mother rather
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
than travel. Sixty or seventy eight. On a bus. So that's been a factor.
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I consider other factors too just wishing for more. Critique on foot perhaps or.
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wanting to have a job that requires you doing. Working in lismore or. Every day.
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Is not the most convenient place to travel to and from on a regular basis at hand and they can be done.
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle. The nuclear family. In the bush.
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This still a lot of facilities a shared for example.
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Most people still do all the washing in the community laundry a couple of pumping systems that provide water to the
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
whole community.
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
when you know that for example if the pump breaks down even though all martin be the one is using that particular pump
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
i'm up at one of the guys down fixes and more problems i always fixing the problem.
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But i do fix the family and i get all the washing machines and things like that. So. And then in terms of.
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The the normal. For example. Bills and debts that.
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A nuclear family living alone in on their own piece of land would incur that's that something that i haven't had to
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
live with for example you know the rights and. Land texas for example. All that sort of stuff. That's part of just.
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Everyone pays a certain amount to the cooperative. Every year and that covers all laws. Talks of bills.
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Sharing certain things yes and having your own.
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
As will definitely be in financial benefit i mean i couldn't have been unemployed for a good many.
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And i certainly couldn't of a career out of this law for almost from a self.
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Unless i could have shared with other people. I suppose it was never a stated goal. Originally.
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But i suppose everybody. Would have lot of would have had that. That concept did. To to be able to somehow be.
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Become economically independent. And live this lifestyle.
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Is just phoning the whys of doing it you know while still looking as a.
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Not really not in this particular community i mean other communities by that i think have perhaps more of a group
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:09,000
consciousness towards. Finance rising and. Economic viability perhaps in us. It's women communities a.
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Really just a product of the sum total of the people who happen to have them and specially with.
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Not so much tunnel because it's a lie. And it drew from such a large.
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Sort of data bias will put some bias when it originally set up it's got. Factions of all stripes sauces and colors.
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But a number of the other all the communities. Probably was started. Primarily from a group of known friends.
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And known friends are usually people with similar ideas and attitudes
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and aspirations to usually get within certain boundaries of us and as a very middle class community.
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
With a lot of people coming from. Generally middle class. Taught backgrounds and. Probably lots of us holding.
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Lots of middle class as an idea is the end of the day.
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I mean i know the community i've been back as wildly almost every shareholder's a schoolteacher and.
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They're very educationally involved. Fantastic fantastic. I can't think of a bit applies.
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:37,000
In terms of some way to bring up one's children. I really can't think of i better place in terms of having.
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Having an informant where your children can not come home as a sara lee from the school bus in the afternoon you won't
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
see them till dark.
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And you're not in the slightest bit worried as to where they've gone that can be with somebody else on the community
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
you know that offline with some friends or. Going to somebody else's place. That's. That's a lot of things as.
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Is obviously the jordan got a degree of freedom by haps and of his innocence to have a degree of freedom.
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That these guys i don't think is this possible. In the urban environment.
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They've learnt to grow up with what are considered good healthy attitudes towards the environment environmental issues
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
just so much for granted.
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because you don't rubbish things and of course you don't do this and of course you don't do that.
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Whereas it had he said we had to learn. Or take on board that they missed just the way it is. And they have got.
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know. Some have said what i want to get out there and. Mike a million bucks.
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Get rich can go to they thought i was done. Mark mark jordan.
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
At this stage just a little bit there and just turning to you know i just know i haven't got any for them
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and fixed attitudes as to what they'd like to really do with themselves once they finish school.
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But i've seen a number of children grow up here and leave. As what i consider a good adult in a lot.
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Interesting people. Good attitudes. Do we'll at school. We certainly haven't. Will or.
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The people who haven't tried to anyway i suppose dollar for education as well. Not the children here have gone.
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
All gone to the public school back as well which is a very nice little. Country school.
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Now we need to get one hundred pupils for teachers just a very good school it's got an enormous amount of community
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:19,000
input into it from the parents is perhaps the best of both rules. It's for a public education and. It's got enough.
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:30,000
External input. That that. It's possible to schools have parallel input does seem to have a lot of.
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Very positive fair unlimber they have things like all cultural. Options.
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Which is when parents will come along and one day a week for maybe a month or six weeks.
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And take a small group of children in a particular. Anything. Are just.
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Bodies to the group of kids making charms out of all forks and spoons and another woman. Did filt miking.
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Just things like that and opportunities for kids to learn things like that. A fiver.
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Remember the story would be here are all part of that one.
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Ask me another question at all while i think we have to put the pause button on.
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Five min with a sense of place in the narrow our really feel proud to sign on from the menu that's where i come from.
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Years ago i saw him from back as violence between cars. But now i'm from niman just out of newman actually. It was.
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It was the paypal. Thing that drew. The drew me here that all the. I was particularly attracted to just the r. D.
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Of settling in an area.
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Lots of lot want to people you know kids and kin and creating a community where you thought like.
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You weren't one of them on already. But the. But that you are one of the establishment. Even though.
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It was your own establishment.
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think that's still what is perhaps my strongest feeling about him
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and you know especially for being a wife a little bit more drop back in didn't even for a few days
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and you drive into town is just so different from anywhere else you know anything new in the him again you there
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and there is total ad of derelicts collapsed in front of the hot bread shop that was yes i was wonderful.
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Brought up the list of use these check hadn't come in and the usual. Kloster at saw the rind.
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And just just all sorts of characters and people in really. Disreputable baggy old thoughts. Wandering along. Yeah.
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Just. Just the color. And the nonconformist. Well it's pretty conforming. With the end isn't it.
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Really are sadly like that
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
when the rat pack came to town with with their shredded claw in their dreadlocks to the news of things like oh
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
wonderful here. I want it visually. On a visual exhorting them and and.
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Are like a lock the whole aspect of chinese to walk the fact that there's all these things happening this is perma
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
culture village already heard kicks off in him and just because it'll mean yet another group of people and more.
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
In georgia and not a lot of the best but.
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I just walked out dynamics of it not being something stagnant that whole lot of all hippies went to die.
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But somewhere where a whole lot of new hippies are coming to live as well yeah.
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like saying the young people not just hippies is people. I mean this. There's lots of.
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Lots of people that are hippies around applies to the moved in for whatever reasons. Good solid people. Yes will.
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Few challenges from them and i think the sewage one of the big challenges that.
