1
00:00:14,72 --> 00:00:18,93
Yes.

2
00:00:21,56 --> 00:00:22,89
Hello my name is bob hopkins.

3
00:00:23,29 --> 00:00:29,27
I'm a long time resident of nim and i've.

4
00:00:30,57 --> 00:00:36,22
Came here primarily as a political
gesture and as a consequence i continue

5
00:00:36,22 --> 00:00:39,31
that these lines of interest within them

6
00:00:39,31 --> 00:00:46,29
and i've been involved over the years
with nima news very active within the

7
00:00:46,29 --> 00:00:53,06
nimbin community school in the main
hall committee currently secretary

8
00:00:53,07 --> 00:00:57,40
and public officer of the
human environment center.

9
00:00:58,80 --> 00:01:04,05
Plus a few others various
organizations associated with that.

10
00:01:05,08 --> 00:01:09,17
And presently i'm working at
the women recycling center.

11
00:01:09,19 --> 00:01:14,53
You.

12
00:01:14,54 --> 00:01:17,64
Know look there have been times when i
possibly could have fitted that bill

13
00:01:17,64 --> 00:01:22,17
but one doesn't maintain these particular.

14
00:01:22,18 --> 00:01:27,82
Titles are too long.

15
00:01:29,58 --> 00:01:33,73
When i first came to him and here the year
before the festival happened so i nym

16
00:01:33,73 --> 00:01:38,89
and tended to stand out in my mind i was
working for a chap in sydney who wanted to

17
00:01:38,89 --> 00:01:42,27
set up a primal therapy
centre in the country.

18
00:01:42,36 --> 00:01:47,28
He was looking for undeveloped land.

19
00:01:47,29 --> 00:01:53,86
The real estate agents in lismore all
said undeveloped land dirty land you want

20
00:01:53,86 --> 00:01:58,68
names and so i came to them and here and
one hundred seventy two. It was very much.

21
00:01:58,72 --> 00:01:59,39
Just a really.

22
00:02:02,55 --> 00:02:06,12
Forgotten little town it was a town
in the middle of a rural decline.

23
00:02:07,08 --> 00:02:08,56
Most of the shops were either empty

24
00:02:08,56 --> 00:02:14,20
or being lived in as residents
the farming community was very

25
00:02:17,29 --> 00:02:22,73
poor rundown people living on not a great
deal of income how there were farms for

26
00:02:22,73 --> 00:02:25,20
sale all over the place.

27
00:02:25,22 --> 00:02:31,34
I travelled on from their return to
lismore the next year as a student of the

28
00:02:32,19 --> 00:02:36,58
teachers college. And.
As fate would have it.

29
00:02:36,59 --> 00:02:39,49
I was right on the spot

30
00:02:39,49 --> 00:02:46,67
when the festival happened.

31
00:02:48,68 --> 00:02:54,12
Well yeah but it's interesting in a sort
of historical perspective we my wife

32
00:02:54,12 --> 00:03:00,97
and myself were both
pretty young at. Right.

33
00:03:02,99 --> 00:03:08,85
My son was born on the second
day of the festival. And.

34
00:03:08,86 --> 00:03:11,11
My wife and i were both pretty young at

35
00:03:11,11 --> 00:03:18,71
that time pretty unsure about doing
a home birth by ourselves we.

36
00:03:18,73 --> 00:03:21,47
From the point of view
of the fact that birth

37
00:03:21,47 --> 00:03:25,21
and beyond as a home birth
organizations existed now.

38
00:03:25,23 --> 00:03:28,92
In nimbin for the last 17 years.

39
00:03:28,94 --> 00:03:34,30
It's interesting too it
makes it an interesting.

40
00:03:35,01 --> 00:03:36,76
Time capsule.

41
00:03:36,92 --> 00:03:40,57
We tried to get a doctor or a midwife at

42
00:03:40,57 --> 00:03:43,90
that time to attend the birth

43
00:03:44,74 --> 00:03:49,21
but found it very difficult so
we went to the northern star

44
00:03:49,21 --> 00:03:51,85
and advertised for a
doctor or a midwife and at

45
00:03:51,85 --> 00:03:56,80
that stage they wouldn't accept the ad
because it was considered to be an obscene

46
00:03:56,80 --> 00:03:59,57
ad. It's interesting. Now i mean.

47
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,44
In light of all the changes that
have gone on around the area

48
00:04:03,44 --> 00:04:06,20
that these it gives a an interesting.

49
00:04:06,81 --> 00:04:09,24
Sense of the passing of
time and the changes

50
00:04:09,24 --> 00:04:15,93
that have been wrought by this society.

51
00:04:19,07 --> 00:04:23,68
The first of all affected the
town in a pretty fundamental way.

52
00:04:23,70 --> 00:04:25,27
Because what it meant was

53
00:04:25,27 --> 00:04:28,67
that the people a lot of the people
who came here decided to stay.

54
00:04:30,07 --> 00:04:33,60
It's a beautiful area land
was cheap land was plentiful

55
00:04:36,19 --> 00:04:38,59
and the feeling was so
good at the festival

56
00:04:38,59 --> 00:04:42,27
that a lot of people wished to maintain

57
00:04:43,09 --> 00:04:46,86
that sense of satisfaction.

58
00:04:46,88 --> 00:04:53,23
The festival itself was also conceived
as an ongoing festival it wasn't

59
00:04:53,23 --> 00:04:59,27
it. It was part of a series
of biennial festivals

60
00:04:59,27 --> 00:05:05,78
that were run by the national union
union of australian university students

61
00:05:07,13 --> 00:05:10,84
and were arts oriented what
had happened in the past was

62
00:05:10,84 --> 00:05:14,72
that festivals tended to set up for a
couple of weeks people would hang their

63
00:05:14,72 --> 00:05:18,08
paintings a few drama
activities would go on.

64
00:05:19,78 --> 00:05:22,77
But this way and then at the end
everyone would pack up and go away

65
00:05:22,77 --> 00:05:27,33
but with this one. It was conceived
as an ongoing festival of lifestyles

66
00:05:28,94 --> 00:05:31,87
and that's exactly what happened
and the way i see it is

67
00:05:31,87 --> 00:05:34,09
that the festival has
never really stopped.

68
00:05:34,19 --> 00:05:41,00
It's been an ongoing 20 year
exercise in people seeking to

69
00:05:42,32 --> 00:05:46,07
bring about a fundamental change
in lifestyles community politics.

70
00:05:47,92 --> 00:05:50,56
The way that people relate to each other

71
00:05:50,56 --> 00:05:56,97
and to the environment
particularly and it still goes on.

72
00:05:57,38 --> 00:05:59,74
It's still happening all
the time it's got a.

73
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,28
A remarkable sort of history
of achievements behind it.

74
00:06:04,32 --> 00:06:09,86
Now in things as diverse as well.

75
00:06:09,88 --> 00:06:12,36
Birth and beyond popularizing home birth.

76
00:06:13,66 --> 00:06:19,37
And empowering women along the way the
changes in the multiple occupancy laws

77
00:06:19,37 --> 00:06:23,19
that were one of the first changes
in tenure for a very long time.

78
00:06:25,36 --> 00:06:31,18
The environmental political through
us that came from here that started.

79
00:06:32,33 --> 00:06:38,05
And culminated in the training forest
protest the manatee forest protests

80
00:06:38,05 --> 00:06:44,59
that just went on to other areas as
people realized the environmental

81
00:06:44,59 --> 00:06:47,42
imperatives.

82
00:06:49,67 --> 00:06:53,78
The whole turn ative energy
lobby is been particularly

83
00:06:56,48 --> 00:07:02,62
persistent here which is resulted in the
formation of the rainbow power company.

84
00:07:04,03 --> 00:07:04,55
The music

85
00:07:04,55 --> 00:07:13,63
that has come out of here has
been at times most particularly

86
00:07:13,64 --> 00:07:23,53
nimbin which is again reflected the attitudes
in the lifestyle through the music.

87
00:07:23,55 --> 00:07:24,98
Idea what else is.

88
00:07:26,35 --> 00:07:39,86
Happened over here over the last 20 years.

89
00:07:41,00 --> 00:07:42,69
What is particular about and him and.

90
00:07:45,04 --> 00:07:51,62
Is a a larrikin a particularly
larrikin australian

91
00:07:51,62 --> 00:07:54,47
tendency to

92
00:07:58,41 --> 00:08:04,06
seek to go for what. People consider
to be appropriate within themselves.

93
00:08:05,02 --> 00:08:09,20
In a way that's full of
a combination of humor.

94
00:08:11,10 --> 00:08:18,92
Political confrontation.

95
00:08:27,28 --> 00:08:29,50
That are reflected a creative urge

96
00:08:30,94 --> 00:08:37,00
that was most manifest in the
culture through the music in the

97
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:42,49
1970s music was a real powerful cultural
force it's become absorbed more

98
00:08:42,49 --> 00:08:47,28
and more by the industry over
the years but the music in them

99
00:08:47,28 --> 00:08:51,17
and has remained so there's always been.

100
00:08:51,57 --> 00:08:55,33
Within the within nimbin.

101
00:08:55,34 --> 00:09:03,12
A tendency to.

102
00:09:04,10 --> 00:09:10,41
Express the you earnings for community
for the the magic of life for

103
00:09:11,66 --> 00:09:15,89
an earth based spirituality
through the music.

104
00:09:17,14 --> 00:09:20,23
You know it's not really my forte

105
00:09:20,24 --> 00:09:37,99
but.

106
00:09:40,04 --> 00:09:44,16
A lot of people have moved on.
For a lot of different reasons.

107
00:09:44,48 --> 00:09:46,01
Out of frustration maybe

108
00:09:46,01 --> 00:09:50,15
that they haven't achieved what they thought
they were going to are maybe they've

109
00:09:50,15 --> 00:09:51,04
found that their.

110
00:09:51,44 --> 00:09:56,40
Their actual life doesn't necessarily
correspond with the original dream.

111
00:09:58,36 --> 00:09:59,61
But a lot of people have stayed.

112
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,45
The communities of continue to grow and
strengthen and expand and developing.

113
00:10:06,46 --> 00:10:12,50
In ways that serve a particular need
of the people who are here for me.

114
00:10:13,46 --> 00:10:17,41
Nimbin was a political possibility

115
00:10:18,75 --> 00:10:24,03
or it offered the opportunity for a
political possibility that we touched upon.

116
00:10:25,04 --> 00:10:31,15
I guess in the 60s during the times
of the vietnam conflict and all

117
00:10:31,92 --> 00:10:33,27
that was associated with that

118
00:10:35,28 --> 00:10:39,71
and it seemed as though nimbin was a place
where it was possible to actually create

119
00:10:39,71 --> 00:10:48,60
some sort of new society which was based
upon this new alternative way of thinking.

120
00:10:48,61 --> 00:10:53,83
And it does it offers these possibilities
it continues to offer these possibilities.

121
00:10:53,85 --> 00:10:57,94
Because niman is a media name nationally.

122
00:10:59,96 --> 00:11:02,39
People will notice things
that come out of nimbin.

123
00:11:03,58 --> 00:11:09,77
The initiatives in all realms of sort
of political and community life.

124
00:11:13,21 --> 00:11:19,93
The ability to meet people who are interested
in working in the same areas as you

125
00:11:19,93 --> 00:11:24,72
out of a particular need for instance through
the community school in other areas.

126
00:11:25,08 --> 00:11:31,50
It was difficult to establish systems
of alternative schooling because of the

127
00:11:31,50 --> 00:11:38,43
small numbers of people in
nimbin with the prevailing

128
00:11:39,15 --> 00:11:46,10
social situation which didn't allow a
great deal for the children of the

129
00:11:46,10 --> 00:11:52,73
new settlers the tendency to
want to create an expression of

130
00:11:54,04 --> 00:11:58,92
an alternative education system was
able to succeed simply because of the.

131
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:06,24
Large numbers of people who were
in the area and who desired this.

132
00:12:06,26 --> 00:12:07,58
Like a lot of other things.

133
00:12:07,76 --> 00:12:12,17
Society has changed over the years since
then and a lot of the initiatives

134
00:12:12,17 --> 00:12:16,90
that was started at the community school
have now been absorbed into the central

135
00:12:16,90 --> 00:12:17,96
school system.

136
00:12:22,07 --> 00:12:27,49
And while the community school still
manages to exist it doesn't have the same

137
00:12:31,50 --> 00:12:31,95
support

138
00:12:31,96 --> 00:12:38,91
that it once did have this could be
a combination of prevailing changes

139
00:12:38,92 --> 00:12:42,75
in people's attitude toward schooling

140
00:12:44,76 --> 00:12:49,51
but i think to a large extent it's it's
come about as a consequence of the changes

141
00:12:49,51 --> 00:12:56,48
that have been forged

142
00:12:58,76 --> 00:13:01,14
by comparison with the prevailing systems

143
00:13:01,14 --> 00:13:05,58
or by the the prevailing system looking
at what we were doing at the community

144
00:13:05,58 --> 00:13:05,90
school

145
00:13:05,90 --> 00:13:13,25
and altering their approach in order
to accommodate more the alternative.

146
00:13:14,10 --> 00:13:33,58
The alternative education through us.

147
00:13:33,60 --> 00:13:34,81
20 years is a long time.

148
00:13:35,06 --> 00:13:39,00
A lot of changes happen in 20 years 20
years ago women weren't allowed in public

149
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:40,74
bars.

150
00:13:44,81 --> 00:13:47,87
But society has undergone a
huge transformation during

151
00:13:47,87 --> 00:13:53,28
that period of time organic agriculture
is now been recognized as being.

152
00:13:54,28 --> 00:13:59,90
An almost imperative for
australian farmers. The senses.

153
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,18
I'm environmental imperatives
of also changed.

154
00:14:06,20 --> 00:14:12,74
Nimbin as almost. Bored about.

155
00:14:15,08 --> 00:14:19,80
A. Women as.

156
00:14:23,10 --> 00:14:26,30
Women as manifested.
What it set out to do.

157
00:14:26,54 --> 00:14:33,14
In the sense of putting a series of particular
issues into the public consciousness.

158
00:14:33,16 --> 00:14:35,17
This is where the challenge
lies for them and.

159
00:14:35,67 --> 00:14:42,50
To be able to look at the next 20 years
and lay down a vision that will hold for.

160
00:14:44,92 --> 00:14:46,29
That will in 20 years time.

161
00:14:47,86 --> 00:14:53,84
Be considered as being pertinent

162
00:14:54,82 --> 00:15:00,61
and fundamental to nature of
society. But there is also a longer.

163
00:15:00,63 --> 00:15:04,92
Aim that is there the
original aquarius festival.

164
00:15:04,93 --> 00:15:10,09
Concentrated on a sense of tribes and
community in relation to the environment

165
00:15:11,74 --> 00:15:14,73
and this is one of the things that
continues to attract me here and.

166
00:15:15,05 --> 00:15:16,67
And what i see is happening is

167
00:15:16,67 --> 00:15:22,00
that there is a particular culture being
formed for the earth to be sustainable.

168
00:15:22,12 --> 00:15:28,28
It needs a sense of tribalism of people who
have grown up in a particular area who

169
00:15:28,28 --> 00:15:33,35
are committed to living in a particular
area who get to know the area intimately

170
00:15:34,44 --> 00:15:39,67
who forged. An ongoing.

171
00:15:39,69 --> 00:15:45,23
Culture that takes into account
the area in which you live.

172
00:15:48,57 --> 00:15:55,55
And i guess the in the long run the value

173
00:15:55,56 --> 00:15:58,76
of newman will be seen. After
a two or three generations.

174
00:16:01,15 --> 00:16:04,22
And it's only then really that.

175
00:16:04,24 --> 00:16:08,07
Name and will be able to be
seen whether or not we're.

176
00:16:08,60 --> 00:16:10,81
We've created a society

177
00:16:10,81 --> 00:16:17,01
that is equal to the task the 20
year periods are useful in so far as

178
00:16:17,01 --> 00:16:22,17
that they do provide a measuring
point of how far we've come.

179
00:16:27,53 --> 00:16:34,34
But there is still the challenge
there for us to continue to put into

180
00:16:34,34 --> 00:16:36,21
effect.

181
00:16:37,13 --> 00:16:38,46
Whatever the vision is

182
00:16:38,46 --> 00:16:43,57
that any one particular point of time so
much time is spent just holding ground

183
00:16:43,57 --> 00:16:46,15
against the forces that are out there

184
00:16:46,15 --> 00:16:52,70
that would potentially
overrun this point of view

185
00:16:52,70 --> 00:16:59,70
that exists here in and
so as a consequence.

186
00:16:59,72 --> 00:17:02,66
There are a lot of areas of social life

187
00:17:02,66 --> 00:17:07,87
that a possibly lacking
in terms of the vision.

188
00:17:10,75 --> 00:17:16,32
We've currently got the situation in town
where people are getting upset about the

189
00:17:16,32 --> 00:17:17,76
state of.

190
00:17:19,99 --> 00:17:21,02
Street behaviour

191
00:17:21,02 --> 00:17:25,63
and drug related issues

192
00:17:27,43 --> 00:17:32,31
and this is an area where which
i see is very pertinent to

193
00:17:34,49 --> 00:17:37,44
the whole idea of nimbin
it seems fundamental to me

194
00:17:37,44 --> 00:17:44,37
that no needs to rise to this
task confront the problem

195
00:17:44,37 --> 00:17:45,95
of drugs in this society

196
00:17:47,26 --> 00:17:54,83
and look at it in a new way implement new
directions rather than resorting to.

197
00:17:54,85 --> 00:17:59,80
The old ways but it's very difficult
to step outside the dominant.

198
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,19
Thinking forms and

199
00:18:01,19 --> 00:18:06,94
and actually implement change a change

200
00:18:08,80 --> 00:18:13,69
that i would. In relation to
the to the drug issues in.

201
00:18:17,91 --> 00:18:24,34
What we need is a a radical
reappraisal of the

202
00:18:25,91 --> 00:18:32,15
drug situation how it affects us to
look at what it's doing to our society

203
00:18:33,02 --> 00:18:39,40
and trying to create some
new form of approach

204
00:18:39,41 --> 00:18:41,97
to the whole issue of drug use.

205
00:18:45,00 --> 00:18:50,10
To do this we really need to step outside.

206
00:18:51,16 --> 00:18:52,44
The whole of the dominant society

207
00:18:56,15 --> 00:18:59,77
and forget the particular laws.

208
00:18:59,79 --> 00:19:05,95
And create almost in a theatrical form
a new scenario a new paradigm for

209
00:19:07,60 --> 00:19:13,01
possibility marijuana has been

210
00:19:14,37 --> 00:19:20,98
associated with nimbin pretty much
right from the start as it was a

211
00:19:20,98 --> 00:19:21,53
substance

212
00:19:21,53 --> 00:19:25,24
that was taken up by the early hippies

213
00:19:29,48 --> 00:19:35,22
and it was one of those it
has become a sacrament.

214
00:19:35,24 --> 00:19:40,41
In those early days it still
does have this aspect about it

215
00:19:41,22 --> 00:19:43,26
but what's happened over
the course of time is

216
00:19:43,26 --> 00:19:48,38
that the price for this particular
substance has risen alarmingly

217
00:19:51,06 --> 00:19:53,41
and because it has such a cash value.

218
00:19:54,52 --> 00:19:59,62
It was one of the first things that people
stopped sharing where they were able.

219
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,87
To reenter into the consumption
of a society without

220
00:20:06,89 --> 00:20:11,92
having to commit a large slice of
your life to working in offices

221
00:20:11,92 --> 00:20:15,19
or working for corporations
or working in business

222
00:20:15,19 --> 00:20:15,68
and commerce

223
00:20:20,14 --> 00:20:22,68
and although it is seen to be
part of the freedom of nimh

224
00:20:22,68 --> 00:20:28,86
and it is part of the reason why
niman is so in the seeds of its own

225
00:20:29,58 --> 00:20:35,71
destruction in this to me just
pinpoint even more directly

226
00:20:37,07 --> 00:20:40,10
the imperative for change
in this direction.

227
00:20:50,69 --> 00:20:55,21
Within the drug issue
particularly at the moment in nim

228
00:20:55,21 --> 00:21:00,11
and vast sums of money.

229
00:21:03,63 --> 00:21:08,49
At the moment in and
large amounts of money.

230
00:21:08,50 --> 00:21:15,28
Transferred between people
in the sale of marijuana.

231
00:21:16,69 --> 00:21:23,11
None of this money returns itself to the
general community it goes always to

232
00:21:23,11 --> 00:21:28,45
individual people. If in them

233
00:21:28,45 --> 00:21:35,18
and we could regulate the sale of
marijuana in much the same way

234
00:21:35,18 --> 00:21:37,10
that it happens the best model.

235
00:21:40,02 --> 00:21:44,71
For where it is happening is in holland
where marijuana has a sort of quasi legal

236
00:21:44,71 --> 00:21:50,12
stage as marijuana in holland
has a quasi legal status

237
00:21:52,21 --> 00:21:56,83
where its sold in coffee shops its tax.

238
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,39
And the responsibility is on
the actual seller to make sure

239
00:22:06,81 --> 00:22:13,63
that they're they take
responsibility for the

240
00:22:15,49 --> 00:22:18,73
fact that they're involved in
selling an intoxicating substance.

241
00:22:19,98 --> 00:22:26,04
If we were able to do the same thing
in nimbin we would have the people who

242
00:22:29,51 --> 00:22:34,47
sorry. Let's just give us
scenario of a possible change.

243
00:22:34,49 --> 00:22:41,71
If we had the rainbow cafe for
instance selling pot over the counter.

244
00:22:41,73 --> 00:22:43,69
Then.

245
00:22:44,73 --> 00:22:49,83
What we could do would be to undercut the
street price which would at limit the

246
00:22:49,83 --> 00:22:50,21
hustle

247
00:22:50,21 --> 00:22:54,89
that happens on the street would eliminate
the competitiveness of the violence.

248
00:22:55,92 --> 00:23:00,68
It would take away the possibility for
the sort of parasitical chemical.

249
00:23:01,02 --> 00:23:02,54
Heroines be.

250
00:23:03,14 --> 00:23:05,01
Cocaine sellers

251
00:23:05,01 --> 00:23:11,82
that are attracted by the the large
amounts of money by the illegality

252
00:23:12,86 --> 00:23:13,23
by the fact

253
00:23:13,23 --> 00:23:22,19
that there is an element of opposition

254
00:23:24,07 --> 00:23:28,98
to the laws. And these
people have been bleeding.

255
00:23:29,67 --> 00:23:34,21
The community dry.

256
00:23:36,71 --> 00:23:39,85
If we had the rainbow cafe selling it.

257
00:23:39,85 --> 00:23:46,80
Then they could it would
be i conceive of if the

258
00:23:46,80 --> 00:23:49,65
rainbow cafe was selling
pot over the counter.

259
00:23:50,03 --> 00:23:53,79
Then they would take on a responsibility
for administering the whole scene.

260
00:23:54,02 --> 00:23:57,28
It would be up to them
to make sure that their.

261
00:24:00,90 --> 00:24:05,02
Aren't the sort of congestion or that
there is in the sort of congestion

262
00:24:05,02 --> 00:24:10,17
that exists in front of the rainbow cafe
the hustling the dealing that upsets

263
00:24:10,17 --> 00:24:13,77
and outrages tourists
visitors locals alike

264
00:24:18,53 --> 00:24:18,87
at the moment.

265
00:24:19,06 --> 00:24:26,60
Alcohol is sold without any
responsibility being placed on.

266
00:24:26,62 --> 00:24:30,71
The dispensers of alcohol to
really look after the people

267
00:24:31,69 --> 00:24:34,71
that the alcohol affects

268
00:24:34,71 --> 00:24:38,90
that they sell to i would say

269
00:24:38,90 --> 00:24:41,80
that pubs should be able to

270
00:24:41,80 --> 00:24:48,77
or should be made to provide child care
centers social workers people who just

271
00:24:48,77 --> 00:24:50,98
mingle with the crowds make sure

272
00:24:50,98 --> 00:24:53,77
that nobody who is looking
like they're becoming drunk

273
00:24:53,77 --> 00:24:58,89
and becoming a problem to
themselves and to the society.

274
00:24:58,91 --> 00:25:05,86
Should not be allowed to procure
any more alcohol in the same

275
00:25:05,86 --> 00:25:12,61
way i apply the same line of
reasoning to marijuana sales the

276
00:25:12,61 --> 00:25:19,39
people whose dispense the drugs
should be made to be to be

277
00:25:19,39 --> 00:25:26,01
held responsible for the consequences of
what goes down following the marijuana

278
00:25:26,01 --> 00:25:30,91
sales at the moment though because the
whole thing has an illegal status.

279
00:25:33,60 --> 00:25:38,13
It's outside the realm of
society to really regulate. We.

280
00:25:39,37 --> 00:25:44,06
You can have the police come
in and pick off a few dealers

281
00:25:46,34 --> 00:25:47,02
but by the time

282
00:25:47,02 --> 00:25:50,62
that their work their way through the
mountain of paper the fingerprinting.

283
00:25:51,29 --> 00:25:55,24
Identification the photos.

284
00:25:55,26 --> 00:25:59,87
Another two people could easily have
joined the street sellers by that.

285
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:00,32
Time

286
00:26:02,27 --> 00:26:05,56
and at the end of the day the people who've
been arrested are just back on the streets

287
00:26:05,56 --> 00:26:11,07
and ealing again. It's just that
the the war on drugs approach.

288
00:26:11,69 --> 00:26:14,20
Hasn't worked in any country in the world.

289
00:26:14,48 --> 00:26:17,44
In fact it's been
counterproductive in the same way

290
00:26:17,44 --> 00:26:20,13
that it's been counterproductive here.

291
00:26:21,37 --> 00:26:27,96
There's a disproportionate sense of
values being put down to the young

292
00:26:27,96 --> 00:26:29,59
people.

293
00:26:30,77 --> 00:26:34,44
A week's work and maybe we'll
do three hundred dollars

294
00:26:34,44 --> 00:26:37,49
but announce a pot can
potentially year old you 400

295
00:26:37,49 --> 00:26:42,11
or 500 dollars.

296
00:26:42,13 --> 00:26:44,65
It's promoted.

297
00:26:44,67 --> 00:26:50,71
Suspicion between people because
of the fact that your own.

298
00:26:51,90 --> 00:26:56,90
Pot is likely to be ripped
off. Sale. On the streets.

299
00:26:56,94 --> 00:26:59,51
There's no way you can trace
it there is no protection

300
00:26:59,51 --> 00:27:05,08
that you have so people tend to
become suspicious of everyone.

301
00:27:06,97 --> 00:27:13,61
Paranoid potentially even sort of
heading in the direction of taken

302
00:27:13,61 --> 00:27:17,08
violent measures to protect their crops
these are the drug problems for me.

303
00:27:17,37 --> 00:27:19,36
Rip offs are a big drug problem.

304
00:27:19,40 --> 00:27:25,43
Not necessarily the the street
scene which in a lot of cases

305
00:27:28,16 --> 00:27:32,07
doesn't necessarily relate to drugs

306
00:27:32,07 --> 00:27:38,48
but it's associated with drugs because of
the types of people who come looking for

307
00:27:39,27 --> 00:27:46,07
an easy way to make money an easy
society where things are a bit more

308
00:27:46,07 --> 00:27:50,15
open and tolerated than any
other parts of australia

309
00:27:50,15 --> 00:27:59,55
that i've encountered.

310
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,13
And nimbin.

311
00:28:05,65 --> 00:28:12,51
Regularly used to hold these anti-heroine
meetings as heroin as sort of risen from

312
00:28:12,51 --> 00:28:16,42
time to time into a state of prominence

313
00:28:16,42 --> 00:28:21,11
and pretty widespread
use throughout the town

314
00:28:27,03 --> 00:28:29,33
and public meetings have been held at two

315
00:28:29,33 --> 00:28:36,19
or three year intervals at which time it
was more of an opportunity for people to

316
00:28:37,26 --> 00:28:40,60
vent their anger their frustration.

317
00:28:41,74 --> 00:28:48,52
Generally to attack the police
for not doing enough attack

318
00:28:48,52 --> 00:28:51,43
indiscriminately all users.

319
00:28:52,55 --> 00:28:59,24
No matter what they were using it
did nothing really to bring about a

320
00:28:59,24 --> 00:29:02,38
sense of progress

321
00:29:02,39 --> 00:29:07,54
or harmony for myself i started to notice

322
00:29:07,54 --> 00:29:12,40
that people started to believe what others
said about their particular habits so

323
00:29:12,40 --> 00:29:17,58
marijuana users tended to
actually become to feel

324
00:29:17,58 --> 00:29:20,40
that they were somehow rather
the outcasts of society

325
00:29:20,40 --> 00:29:27,24
that they were criminal it diminished
their own sense of self-esteem their own

326
00:29:27,24 --> 00:29:29,57
sense of being their own
sense of value in life

327
00:29:35,51 --> 00:29:41,56
and so i figured that the time
had come when i just had to try

328
00:29:41,57 --> 00:29:43,57
and bring about a change because the more

329
00:29:43,57 --> 00:29:51,18
that people felt victimized by the the

330
00:29:51,19 --> 00:29:54,17
anti-drug feelings.

331
00:29:56,86 --> 00:29:59,46
The less that they were
likely to play an active.

332
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,60
Role in determining the future of
their own society there was more.

333
00:30:05,32 --> 00:30:09,50
They were more likely
to keep out of society.

334
00:30:10,17 --> 00:30:12,85
Try and.

335
00:30:13,62 --> 00:30:19,17
Guard their sources of income through
growing pot which really didn't

336
00:30:20,71 --> 00:30:24,62
do a great deal towards
making this a better society

337
00:30:24,62 --> 00:30:31,00
or a better community
to live in. And so i.

338
00:30:31,76 --> 00:30:38,52
I stepped out from the
the cover of anonymity

339
00:30:39,35 --> 00:30:45,53
to take on the drug laws which
in itself is pretty fascinating

340
00:30:46,61 --> 00:30:53,04
because the whole nature of
drug use in society is has

341
00:30:53,04 --> 00:30:57,83
implications and replications right
throughout so many strata of life.

342
00:31:06,15 --> 00:31:13,01
I stood for parliament last year as being
on a i stood for parliament last year on

343
00:31:13,01 --> 00:31:18,97
a drug reform ticket. Ok. Yeah.

344
00:31:24,24 --> 00:31:24,94
I maintained.

345
00:31:31,34 --> 00:31:36,28
After the last big heroin meeting which was
held in 1988 i formed a group here cool

346
00:31:36,28 --> 00:31:39,84
nearly normal nimbin which
was a bit of a pun based.
