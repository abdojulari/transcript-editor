1
00:00:33,9 --> 00:00:43,59
I did occasion this is station twelve faith and and B.P. Will continue in a few seconds time and to fight education.

2
00:00:43,61 --> 00:01:00,35
This was in the early fifty's. And I will also check that. Now. Also there were. I think Linfox was.

3
00:01:00,37 --> 00:01:06,57
Before he was married this what. But speaking about metaphor.

4
00:01:06,68 --> 00:01:16,17
He was the black sheep of the very wealthy family more because of his politics and I think when he was he went to.

5
00:01:16,78 --> 00:01:24,29
He spent a lot of time in Hungary and he was in the ME. The British Army I think.

6
00:01:24,64 --> 00:01:37,49
And spoke fluently very bright person. I think he got his degree from Cambridge. But I wouldn't say for sure.

7
00:01:38,77 --> 00:01:46,93
But he was an extremely humble person but a very gifted person and I should lend you some of his or

8
00:01:46,93 --> 00:01:51,32
when your piano comes you can come up here and play some of his music

9
00:01:51,32 --> 00:01:59,6
and that lute hanging on the wall in the lounge room was a present from to your heart. Well he and Katie.

10
00:02:00,17 --> 00:02:06,64
Were the black sheep you know and they didn't have close friendships relationships with their own family

11
00:02:07,5 --> 00:02:11,14
and they used to go and visit the only mother.

12
00:02:11,43 --> 00:02:16,06
But it drove Katie mad because the kids couldn't drop a crumb on the floor and all that kind of thing.

13
00:02:16,22 --> 00:02:21,87
And when I got to know some little better. They came and had their holidays with us. The Trenches forest.

14
00:02:23,71 --> 00:02:34,23
Well drawn first at this conference chairman. Great personality. It's a tragedy. He. This was never captured on video.

15
00:02:36,87 --> 00:02:48,33
And he good looking guy great. For music. Playing the lute he made. He playing the flute.

16
00:02:48,84 --> 00:02:57,24
He made record is an amazing person and he wrote future for poetry.

17
00:02:59,05 --> 00:03:04,08
Person Where you see I met you on the air with this conference. I met Steve and Mary Smith.

18
00:03:04,32 --> 00:03:12,8
I remember Steven coming and visiting us at French's forest and we lived on my road at that time.

19
00:03:13,29 --> 00:03:17,57
And so he put a little note on his shoulders and carried her backwards

20
00:03:17,57 --> 00:03:32,29
and forwards to the car which was parked about three hundred meters away from my house because the road was rough. And.

21
00:03:33,25 --> 00:03:40,59
People from all writers from all over Australia. I have a feeling that Rodney Hall was.

22
00:03:41,27 --> 00:03:50,7
Just beginning his career as a writer but I must talk to Rodney about this because he leaned

23
00:03:50,7 --> 00:03:57,39
and took him under his wing in prison. And helped Rodney I know that.

24
00:03:58,38 --> 00:04:10,96
Yes and I did feel that I could possibly put a sentence together. I was always a great letter writer.

25
00:04:11,19 --> 00:04:14,34
And like my mother was a great later writer.

26
00:04:14,72 --> 00:04:20,54
I found out later the other day which you'd written to my sister Catherine in the fifty's.

27
00:04:20,99 --> 00:04:31,2
But she was she had this stepsister who lived at the foot of man. On the trade and.

28
00:04:31,66 --> 00:04:38,73
That was a seven mile away from where we live but they wrote to each other everybody.

29
00:04:38,75 --> 00:04:43,17
And mother would sit and wait for that later to come and then she'd sit down straight away

30
00:04:43,17 --> 00:04:53,75
and get me to post a letter writing was very important in a family. My sister was a great letter writer.

31
00:04:53,98 --> 00:05:02,98
And I have many letters from my brother John. And the wonderful habit of writing letters.

32
00:05:03,48 --> 00:05:09,22
And I've just been looking at my file of her letters. It's just beautiful. It is wonderful.

33
00:05:09,65 --> 00:05:26,29
Well I thought Look forget about the books and then. I did a lot of things to help the writers in different way.

34
00:05:27,47 --> 00:05:33,97
I recall when there was another conference which John manifold. That was held in the city.

35
00:05:34,39 --> 00:05:47,32
And like William Hatfill do or do you did you read any if you know well he's an Australian like Mike.

36
00:05:47,97 --> 00:05:52,89
And I have he was the brother in law or of MARGARET FULTON.

37
00:05:54,34 --> 00:06:05,19
And his wife and with his wife he lived on the whole little house and I would often go up and visit them.

38
00:06:05,21 --> 00:06:13,24
And Margaret was living with them at one stage and we'd take turns of fire at night

39
00:06:13,24 --> 00:06:28,16
and you know I can always remember saying. Time for a little to think get something in the half and and my next.

40
00:06:28,18 --> 00:06:40,57
I could go into the fuel I haven't. And we quote fish and cook the fish particularly. Just beautiful.

41
00:06:40,66 --> 00:06:48,65
Well they'll have to fill out and his wife were at this other conference of writers that was held in the city

42
00:06:48,65 --> 00:06:58,97
and it was cool to get a publishing house off the ground for basically left wing writers. And it became it was.

43
00:07:00,09 --> 00:07:08,3
And it became known as the Australian book the years.

44
00:07:08,46 --> 00:07:16,72
Australian society I think and I published Australian writers particularly it was Frank how do you.

45
00:07:16,74 --> 00:07:23,39
And I attended that conference and after it was over I can always remember Bill

46
00:07:23,39 --> 00:07:33,85
and Gene saying we're going to the pub for the way in class or a street. At the pub very big old place for a drink.

47
00:07:34,13 --> 00:07:41,16
Come on event. So I was with Bill and Jane and Frank had me.

48
00:07:41,9 --> 00:07:48,55
And John Mann a fellow couple of others us about us and we were.

49
00:07:48,57 --> 00:07:54,22
Now none of these blokes had a tie on and you couldn't get into the lounge without a tie

50
00:07:54,22 --> 00:07:59,75
and the only place women could drink would be in the law all had to go into the lounge

51
00:08:00,78 --> 00:08:09,63
and away to whoever it was wouldn't let the main. But there was one person who had a tie on.

52
00:08:11,5 --> 00:08:18,66
And I think it was the boss here. So he went up with his own and took it over and gave it to me.

53
00:08:20,81 --> 00:08:31,13
And this is what went on and eventually we got them all in the door. Yeah.

54
00:08:31,66 --> 00:08:35,81
And so they were talking about the Australasian book society that was it.

55
00:08:35,89 --> 00:08:44,29
It had already been found that was the last session of the conference that had already been founded and.

56
00:08:45,74 --> 00:09:03,63
Became very involved in it because I was a devout reader. But like I was reading. Classics.

57
00:09:05,15 --> 00:09:15,15
Like when Hans and I were first married. If one was reading a book one would never interrupt.

58
00:09:15,17 --> 00:09:19,76
It had the highest priority. In our place.

59
00:09:20,6 --> 00:09:31,65
And I said Well forming this society will it mean one I have good writers who wouldn't be published by other houses in

60
00:09:31,65 --> 00:09:38,16
some cases because of me which happened. Now we are able to be published.

61
00:09:39,39 --> 00:09:41,77
And I said oh yes this is what it's all about you know.

62
00:09:42,25 --> 00:09:49,7
Well it's not for me really to go into the history of the last relation books

63
00:09:49,7 --> 00:09:54,13
but I can say this that it took up a big part of my life

64
00:09:54,13 --> 00:10:02,69
and life because we would often make the visiting writers who would come into state at the airport because so few

65
00:10:02,69 --> 00:10:09,62
people had cars. We had a car would pick them up and we'd actors to show for.

66
00:10:09,63 --> 00:10:14,33
And take them to the various meetings that would be organized for the launching of the invokes

67
00:10:14,33 --> 00:10:19,93
and they were all cottage. Lectures meetings. Absolutely fascinating.

68
00:10:19,97 --> 00:10:28,55
You know and these houses up there on the Hill and narrow would open up and receive the both of us.

69
00:10:29,72 --> 00:10:34,11
I was just going to. These writers experience.

70
00:10:34,12 --> 00:10:38,09
Real discrimination from the government and I know that they were all a bit.

71
00:10:39,2 --> 00:10:45,04
Well I mean you will lose a great circle of people who have bonded because of your political views as well

72
00:10:45,04 --> 00:10:49,68
but to any of the writers you met at that time they experienced discrimination. Oh yes oh yes.

73
00:10:50,09 --> 00:11:01,74
Rightists experienced discrimination like me in C.S. Would not permit. Graham to be given to. But he gave it to.

74
00:11:01,75 --> 00:11:09,83
Quadrant because quadrant had all the right wing people writing for it was found and passed even Mary Smith

75
00:11:09,83 --> 00:11:19,99
and he was the red. Main series was concerned. So make sure that they didn't get any funding.

76
00:11:22,48 --> 00:11:29,87
I've got to come back to that sometime after I've spoken to my pastor about it because that's a very important part of

77
00:11:29,87 --> 00:11:37,11
my life and also very important part of Australian history that no one has ever recorded.

78
00:11:39,97 --> 00:11:48,78
My God I have to do this book. Just because.
