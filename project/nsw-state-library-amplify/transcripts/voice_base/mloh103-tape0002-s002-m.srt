1
00:00:13,79 --> 00:00:19,04
And then we also had the good fortune
of having the support of the health

2
00:00:19,04 --> 00:00:22,27
and building surveyor for geraniums shire.

3
00:00:22,48 --> 00:00:27,15
You know i was later merged into
the city of lismore but that

4
00:00:27,15 --> 00:00:30,74
that time the health and buildings
of a was one wally duck a ring

5
00:00:30,74 --> 00:00:34,17
and while he was quite fascinated
with what was going on.

6
00:00:35,30 --> 00:00:38,07
And the preparation of the festival
bent over backwards to help us.

7
00:00:38,22 --> 00:00:39,84
He really made it easy for us.

8
00:00:42,14 --> 00:00:46,39
So we the level of the show negotiations
also had this sort of magical quality

9
00:00:46,39 --> 00:00:50,29
and for the resonance to it
was really special time and.

10
00:00:50,57 --> 00:00:54,26
One of the landowners called they
smith was very helpful to us

11
00:00:55,20 --> 00:00:56,60
and they've had a property

12
00:00:56,60 --> 00:01:01,64
that adjoined one of the sites of
the festival which we leased and.

13
00:01:03,27 --> 00:01:05,55
And the boundary was the
creek malcolm creek

14
00:01:06,38 --> 00:01:11,67
and they've took to riding his horse down
to the creek to inspect the boundary

15
00:01:11,67 --> 00:01:12,93
and see how things were developing

16
00:01:12,93 --> 00:01:18,92
and of course one of the nuns was it was a
lot of naked swimming in the creek and.

17
00:01:20,73 --> 00:01:23,51
David course we asked. We can you know.

18
00:01:23,74 --> 00:01:24,65
Go for a ride on a horse

19
00:01:24,65 --> 00:01:28,07
and he'd stand there in these naked women
with take his horse up the creek in a

20
00:01:28,07 --> 00:01:32,63
slight lady godiva and it was just
magical beautiful women you know

21
00:01:34,72 --> 00:01:35,90
and in goodwill.

22
00:01:36,27 --> 00:01:38,68
All i can say you know just a good feeling

23
00:01:40,13 --> 00:01:44,11
that was so like we managed to establish
the vibe of the festival how we wanted the

24
00:01:44,11 --> 00:01:48,37
festival to be early on in the meeting with
the message we were completely taken by

25
00:01:48,37 --> 00:01:52,13
the mcluhan idea that we had to
demonstrate in everything we did

26
00:01:53,96 --> 00:01:59,78
and. And it was difficult at the same
time and more and more people are.

27
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:05,45
I lived in nimbin. And of
the ages of the festival.

28
00:02:07,41 --> 00:02:09,37
What we discovered was
that less work was being

29
00:02:09,37 --> 00:02:13,03
that the more people we were feeding in
the less work was being done the progress

30
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:15,83
on the site getting the toilets and
things made was going very slowly

31
00:02:15,83 --> 00:02:17,73
and exhausting the people
that were doing it.

32
00:02:17,82 --> 00:02:23,41
And meanwhile there was a lot about laying
around in the street so i also had this

33
00:02:23,41 --> 00:02:26,92
difficult job of motivating people. And.

34
00:02:27,78 --> 00:02:32,59
It came to a head for me and it was an
issue that's been that has dogged him

35
00:02:32,60 --> 00:02:37,78
and ever since like the role
of gatekeeping. How do you.

36
00:02:40,24 --> 00:02:44,11
How do you get people to agree on standards
of behaviour when everything is free.

37
00:02:44,37 --> 00:02:46,19
You know. And.

38
00:02:48,26 --> 00:02:53,84
It was personified for me in the arrival
of a particular woman who was which right

39
00:02:53,84 --> 00:02:55,97
and i do not use this word lightly.

40
00:02:57,03 --> 00:03:01,14
She had been brought to town by a
guy who was dabbling in the occult.

41
00:03:03,09 --> 00:03:06,16
And he he had a house a
property over in the coast.

42
00:03:06,17 --> 00:03:10,23
Byron bay way and this woman was
obviously too much and he'd just up

43
00:03:10,23 --> 00:03:12,45
and say well take it a name
and look after your name

44
00:03:12,45 --> 00:03:16,06
and so he literally drove up and pushed
out of the car and left it there.

45
00:03:17,17 --> 00:03:22,14
She was dressed she used
to wear a very short skirt

46
00:03:22,14 --> 00:03:28,61
and in one hand she clutched at a dirty
rag doll much much handled ragdoll she

47
00:03:28,62 --> 00:03:30,78
would have been.

48
00:03:30,80 --> 00:03:36,27
Mid-40s with a hard to say face blown
up by excessive consumption of alcohol

49
00:03:37,35 --> 00:03:43,42
and on the other hand she
clasped bottle. And.

50
00:03:43,44 --> 00:03:47,92
She was a woman of some power
parent she'd been an actress

51
00:03:47,92 --> 00:03:50,71
and she had timing was
immaculate she knew what to say

52
00:03:50,71 --> 00:03:53,84
and how to say it in a way that really
shocked people went to the roof

53
00:03:54,88 --> 00:03:59,49
and it wasn't too long before she was
thrown out of the nimbin pub. And.

54
00:04:01,07 --> 00:04:01,63
And the story is

55
00:04:01,63 --> 00:04:08,15
that the loggers in the niman pub who are
course fascinated by these women hanging

56
00:04:08,15 --> 00:04:10,12
around i mean is this a town.

57
00:04:10,43 --> 00:04:19,13
That didn't have too many young women
suddenly inundated with single women.

58
00:04:19,15 --> 00:04:21,57
He she they were staring at her

59
00:04:21,57 --> 00:04:27,84
and she's just tennis what you want to
fuck with confronting them with the truth.

60
00:04:29,32 --> 00:04:30,57
So they checked around but

61
00:04:30,57 --> 00:04:34,09
that didn't stop her from getting alcohol
so she arranged for other people to buy

62
00:04:35,27 --> 00:04:35,40
booze

63
00:04:36,30 --> 00:04:40,96
and she would lie in the street with a dress
up around the crutch drunk in abusing

64
00:04:40,96 --> 00:04:44,61
people as they were passed.
For me this is a crisis.

65
00:04:44,90 --> 00:04:50,21
You know in our community liaison process
quite apart from setting examples still

66
00:04:50,21 --> 00:04:51,60
expecting to be fed by the festival.

67
00:04:52,56 --> 00:04:54,01
You know to encourage people not to work

68
00:04:54,01 --> 00:04:58,03
and she had a whole following around
you know. So we don't want you know.

69
00:04:58,34 --> 00:05:02,23
It's all just happening man it's all just
happening in the third just happening

70
00:05:02,23 --> 00:05:05,54
and you're just happening and. Festivals
just happening shut up and leave us alone.

71
00:05:07,09 --> 00:05:09,21
So what happened.

72
00:05:09,34 --> 00:05:12,07
You know i try to nail and
say well we can't feed you

73
00:05:12,07 --> 00:05:14,92
and she's fixed me with the
beady eyes and let me know

74
00:05:14,92 --> 00:05:19,20
that i was a double whammy then i
was suffering from overwork at

75
00:05:19,20 --> 00:05:22,32
that time we were working
seven hour seven day weeks

76
00:05:22,32 --> 00:05:27,87
and you know 10 hour days to
go. We had to reinvent the.

77
00:05:27,89 --> 00:05:29,94
The sabbath give us health risk. You know.

78
00:05:30,30 --> 00:05:33,43
Everything was up for invention at this
time we discovered the sabbath was a very

79
00:05:33,43 --> 00:05:39,08
good idea. Take a day off
every seven days and i struck

80
00:05:39,08 --> 00:05:43,67
and i remember being walked around the house
who are staying by my friends you know

81
00:05:43,67 --> 00:05:50,32
and i was totally obsessed. And
grey and only one small problem.

82
00:05:50,64 --> 00:05:53,46
You know i think of all the good things
that happen in remember all this

83
00:05:53,46 --> 00:05:59,86
but it was like. I just had the pride of
the mind. So it was a kind of my fix.

84
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,94
First hexing. You know i guess.

85
00:06:03,59 --> 00:06:07,59
The whole thing about the
aquarius best of all was that.

86
00:06:08,70 --> 00:06:13,32
From the point of view of a university
student studying sociology we had lots of

87
00:06:13,32 --> 00:06:14,24
wonderful ideas.

88
00:06:14,36 --> 00:06:18,13
The practice of being on the street
implementing those ideas with the know

89
00:06:18,13 --> 00:06:20,81
that total reality you're
dealing with people

90
00:06:20,81 --> 00:06:26,55
that didn't have the ideas necessarily had
lots of other working ideas they didn't

91
00:06:26,55 --> 00:06:26,71
associate

92
00:06:26,71 --> 00:06:31,89
or do the university was like a privileged
environment to develop ideas they were

93
00:06:31,89 --> 00:06:34,22
there were fences around i'd
forgotten about the fences

94
00:06:34,22 --> 00:06:37,04
and fences you had so many years
school and pass exams all

95
00:06:37,04 --> 00:06:38,64
that kind of stuff before you were
allowed to join the conversation.

96
00:06:39,22 --> 00:06:40,38
I'd forgotten about that

97
00:06:40,38 --> 00:06:45,52
and i discovered this whole other reality
world community where all kinds of people

98
00:06:45,52 --> 00:06:49,31
turned up and had to deal
with all kinds of energy so

99
00:06:49,32 --> 00:06:52,64
that was my first
confrontation with hexing.

100
00:06:53,36 --> 00:06:54,20
And we managed to solve

101
00:06:54,20 --> 00:06:58,27
that one by going around the people asking
if they you know respect was going on

102
00:06:58,27 --> 00:07:01,97
respect for the locals and everyone who
cared about the festival development go

103
00:07:01,97 --> 00:07:03,84
and talk to this woman and suggest

104
00:07:03,84 --> 00:07:08,26
that she not the so offensive to
the townspeople and it worked.

105
00:07:08,27 --> 00:07:15,03
What happened was that she.
She changed name to angelica.

106
00:07:15,04 --> 00:07:17,24
And disappeared off the street she went

107
00:07:17,24 --> 00:07:21,37
and lived by the time we'd secured the
lease on the festival site and she went

108
00:07:21,37 --> 00:07:25,59
and lived on the festival site and
ceased to be an agitation to the.

109
00:07:26,24 --> 00:07:27,79
The festival production.

110
00:07:29,11 --> 00:07:32,48
So they were the invention all the other
ventures like tipple have tell you another

111
00:07:32,48 --> 00:07:36,31
story about angelica was
that there was a band over

112
00:07:36,31 --> 00:07:39,67
and then be coaching cogan at the time

113
00:07:39,67 --> 00:07:43,95
and they represented the the settlers
who had settled in the main valley.

114
00:07:44,94 --> 00:07:47,46
We'd gone to main in
search of the property

115
00:07:47,46 --> 00:07:51,39
but we've been told clearly by some of the
settlers they didn't want to know about

116
00:07:51,39 --> 00:07:53,77
any festival happening in their
value thank you very much.

117
00:07:54,10 --> 00:07:55,32
They live very quietly

118
00:07:55,32 --> 00:07:57,79
and they were growing their dope
very quietly thank you very much

119
00:07:57,79 --> 00:07:59,22
and didn't want the publicity.

120
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:03,84
But nevertheless we had a lot of supporters
who like the idea of the festival

121
00:08:04,67 --> 00:08:07,22
and cogan offered to
give us a free concert

122
00:08:07,22 --> 00:08:13,51
and i traveled all the way from about
50 kilometers around the back roads.

123
00:08:14,59 --> 00:08:15,72
To give this concert.

124
00:08:15,78 --> 00:08:20,81
Now there was a the debate about
equality and structure was ongoing.

125
00:08:21,32 --> 00:08:23,98
I mean how do you run this organized
everything was up the grabs

126
00:08:23,98 --> 00:08:27,59
and we've had previous conversation
about this where you know.

127
00:08:27,97 --> 00:08:30,32
There'd be no division between performer

128
00:08:30,32 --> 00:08:35,01
and audience like anyone
could be a performer and.

129
00:08:35,92 --> 00:08:40,21
It happened this night that this woman
i spoke of before the witch decided

130
00:08:40,22 --> 00:08:44,45
that she want to sing too. And when
the band sort of rough and said no.

131
00:08:44,63 --> 00:08:46,93
We worked and i think
we don't really help.

132
00:08:47,13 --> 00:08:49,50
She got up on stage and
wander around a bit

133
00:08:49,50 --> 00:08:53,06
and people ignored until she got
one of the microphone leads

134
00:08:53,06 --> 00:08:57,24
and again strangling the drama.

135
00:08:57,98 --> 00:09:01,24
And stopped me walked off
and she set down the drum

136
00:09:01,24 --> 00:09:08,24
and started playing a self you know. I think
you know. And anyway. Talk about hex.

137
00:09:08,93 --> 00:09:13,32
They they came to nimbin in three
cars and on the way back from

138
00:09:13,32 --> 00:09:17,05
that they had a three car collision
they ran into each other right there.

139
00:09:17,08 --> 00:09:22,17
This one yet.

140
00:09:22,18 --> 00:09:26,99
I don't own other occasion i remember
using the name who were a great debate.

141
00:09:27,22 --> 00:09:28,92
Erupted about.

142
00:09:28,94 --> 00:09:32,21
Structure and about who had the right
to be on the stage as a performer

143
00:09:32,21 --> 00:09:37,69
and who hadn't. And escorted by all the
audience got up and got on the stage right.

144
00:09:39,28 --> 00:09:40,63
We had everyone is a performer and.

145
00:09:42,01 --> 00:09:46,20
Such was the dynamic is yes it was just
spontaneous everyone got up and then

146
00:09:46,20 --> 00:09:51,67
and then we tried that for a
while and that didn't work so.

147
00:09:51,69 --> 00:09:58,22
That's where the debates.

148
00:09:58,24 --> 00:09:59,38
Yes. 20.

149
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:07,72
Well it was hiccup mainly for the septic
tank system in the public toilet.

150
00:10:07,73 --> 00:10:11,05
We made anzac day sort of
a festival planning day

151
00:10:11,05 --> 00:10:14,89
and we called people in all the people
involved in producing things as many people

152
00:10:14,89 --> 00:10:17,53
to get there as possible to come
for a meeting about the festival.

153
00:10:17,55 --> 00:10:21,27
So we had a lot of people in town and in
fact it was a mini festival and itself

154
00:10:22,85 --> 00:10:24,53
and.

155
00:10:24,55 --> 00:10:28,75
Nimbin is one of those country towns

156
00:10:28,75 --> 00:10:35,42
that made a major contribution
in blood to both wars and.

157
00:10:36,33 --> 00:10:36,87
One of the things i

158
00:10:36,87 --> 00:10:40,79
when i was reading about the history of
nimbin there are photographs of men from

159
00:10:40,79 --> 00:10:45,45
the tweed valley sitting on the wharf
for people who don't know this area.

160
00:10:45,71 --> 00:10:47,83
It's a riverport.

161
00:10:47,85 --> 00:10:50,39
Told them the northern rivers

162
00:10:50,39 --> 00:10:54,29
and most of the towns the major towns were
settled originally as timber towns to

163
00:10:54,29 --> 00:10:58,38
see the getting towns and its
river ports and more lumber.

164
00:10:58,61 --> 00:11:00,45
With the river port for the tweed

165
00:11:01,76 --> 00:11:06,82
and it was like the wharf was stacked
with the young men being sent off to the

166
00:11:06,82 --> 00:11:07,50
first world war

167
00:11:07,50 --> 00:11:12,02
and they had the feeling this war from
which they exported all the butter

168
00:11:12,02 --> 00:11:13,78
and all of the dairy produce

169
00:11:13,78 --> 00:11:17,43
and the timber all the produce
from the valley was also now.

170
00:11:18,05 --> 00:11:24,26
Exporting its manpower as young men to
go on for fighting this foreign war.

171
00:11:24,28 --> 00:11:26,44
And and they were doing this.

172
00:11:26,48 --> 00:11:29,66
It's obvious to me from the reading because
they were really proud of what they

173
00:11:29,66 --> 00:11:32,07
achieved the settlement.

174
00:11:32,09 --> 00:11:34,03
But the settlement of

175
00:11:34,03 --> 00:11:39,26
that area we're talking about nine hundred
fourteen something would have been only

176
00:11:39,26 --> 00:11:40,31
30 years old.

177
00:11:41,07 --> 00:11:41,18
I mean

178
00:11:41,18 --> 00:11:45,99
that time they'd cleared the forest built
their farms establish a farm economy

179
00:11:47,30 --> 00:11:50,14
and built the towns and the
homes and the churches

180
00:11:51,47 --> 00:11:52,70
and they had a lot to be proud for

181
00:11:52,70 --> 00:11:57,78
that they had brought western civilization
the best of it to this untamed country.

182
00:11:57,94 --> 00:11:59,84
The big scrub it.

183
00:12:00,49 --> 00:12:04,42
It was as if they had you know
by sheer will and this and

184
00:12:04,42 --> 00:12:08,20
that created this community
up here and the proof

185
00:12:08,20 --> 00:12:09,29
that they were part of the empire

186
00:12:09,29 --> 00:12:12,43
and its great future they sent
these young men off to war

187
00:12:12,43 --> 00:12:13,88
and of course they were slaughtered

188
00:12:13,88 --> 00:12:18,01
and i think this my understanding of
this period the spirit went out of it.

189
00:12:19,48 --> 00:12:23,07
And the war memorial speak a lot about
guilt more than glory in this area

190
00:12:23,07 --> 00:12:24,64
and again the second world war

191
00:12:26,14 --> 00:12:32,42
and the aquarius festival
acquired the the nimbin.

192
00:12:32,90 --> 00:12:35,90
Ourself club return services league club.

193
00:12:36,20 --> 00:12:42,50
The $500 and we were using that as the
festival office and when we cleaned up.

194
00:12:42,73 --> 00:12:45,72
To move in there we discovered all
these photographs of you know

195
00:12:46,68 --> 00:12:48,75
that had been reproduced of
all the men from the village

196
00:12:48,75 --> 00:12:50,59
that it served in the
second world war as well

197
00:12:51,60 --> 00:12:53,09
and we had those arranged on the wall.

198
00:12:53,49 --> 00:12:58,42
You know so we're quite conscious of the
war legacy ourselves something we come

199
00:12:58,42 --> 00:13:00,92
and claim the photographs and
put them in story and then.

200
00:13:01,40 --> 00:13:03,04
I had an inquiry a couple of years ago.

201
00:13:03,41 --> 00:13:08,75
Lost no one knows where they are least
we hope we had a modest play. And.

202
00:13:10,36 --> 00:13:11,22
So.

203
00:13:11,24 --> 00:13:15,94
The end of day parade became of special
significance to the nimbin people because

204
00:13:15,94 --> 00:13:18,06
it represented their culture
and what they were proud of

205
00:13:18,06 --> 00:13:22,10
and exist they had so many strangers in
town from the aquarius the still always

206
00:13:22,10 --> 00:13:27,01
talk about the new age and creating this
new culture they put on quite a show.

207
00:13:28,28 --> 00:13:30,43
And we were there to witness the parade

208
00:13:31,13 --> 00:13:35,07
and they went in the parade into the town
hall for the service stands actiq service

209
00:13:35,07 --> 00:13:36,09
and it just at

210
00:13:36,09 --> 00:13:40,89
that moment the septic tank which was much
overloaded by all these visitors in town

211
00:13:40,89 --> 00:13:44,87
blew up and raw sewage ran down
the hill beside the church

212
00:13:44,87 --> 00:13:46,76
and the whole of your side.

213
00:13:46,84 --> 00:13:53,78
The whole and the whole town
stank of thirds that week.

214
00:13:53,80 --> 00:13:58,99
So was.

215
00:14:00,69 --> 00:14:01,40
I'm.

216
00:14:03,04 --> 00:14:08,11
No no no there's lose a
lot of respect for that

217
00:14:08,11 --> 00:14:10,93
but the townspeople is a much so proudly.

218
00:14:11,85 --> 00:14:13,37
Certainly no heckling
or anything like that.

219
00:14:16,71 --> 00:14:20,22
So we approached the
festival and of course.

220
00:14:20,24 --> 00:14:25,39
The closer we got to the more intense it
became the negotiations the work we're

221
00:14:25,40 --> 00:14:27,84
going to but by the time we got
the fence that festival johnny

222
00:14:27,84 --> 00:14:30,64
and i were sort of basket cases.

223
00:14:31,98 --> 00:14:38,11
Johnny allen lost his voice and john
allen is. Has a beautiful tongue.

224
00:14:38,13 --> 00:14:43,16
And beautiful voice. You could spin
tales and get people's agreement.

225
00:14:43,71 --> 00:14:47,36
He couldn't speak. And i couldn't hear.

226
00:14:48,41 --> 00:14:50,39
I was people overload
people would talk to me.

227
00:14:50,41 --> 00:14:54,14
I literally could not hear what they're
saying i just see their lips moving nothing

228
00:14:54,14 --> 00:14:59,33
no meaning went into the brain. I was that
i just had too many so i gotta say that.

229
00:15:02,88 --> 00:15:08,10
By the time the festival began. I was in
no state to enjoy anything except sleep.

230
00:15:08,11 --> 00:15:11,99
And julie and i had made this pact that

231
00:15:11,99 --> 00:15:16,63
when the festival began we
would retire as organizers

232
00:15:16,64 --> 00:15:19,45
and other people take over the
organization of the festival

233
00:15:20,83 --> 00:15:22,00
and let me say it worked.

234
00:15:22,02 --> 00:15:26,87
You know we just literally walked out
of the office and then people arose

235
00:15:26,87 --> 00:15:30,50
and picked up the chills we had a daily
newsletter calling for volunteers.

236
00:15:30,78 --> 00:15:34,91
But one of the major chores
was to keep the toilets clean

237
00:15:34,91 --> 00:15:37,93
and supplied with toilet paper and
lined out and all that kind of stuff.

238
00:15:38,94 --> 00:15:42,98
These were sort of holes in the
ground uni sexual toilets.

239
00:15:43,19 --> 00:15:48,63
You know like this was a great spiritual
breakthrough for some people.

240
00:15:48,65 --> 00:15:52,42
Defecate in mixed company but they're
not all the toilets right there.

241
00:15:52,44 --> 00:15:56,80
But there are some that were deliberately
left that kind of option. Anyway.

242
00:15:56,84 --> 00:15:59,89
Servicing the toilet and keeping
them the things claimed.

243
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,04
The major issue and what happened was

244
00:16:03,04 --> 00:16:07,31
that a woman offered her services she was
a labor organizer for civil and civic.

245
00:16:09,06 --> 00:16:12,30
Civil construction. She got some c.b.

246
00:16:12,30 --> 00:16:14,45
Radios from the state emergency service

247
00:16:15,46 --> 00:16:17,91
and teller team of people who
used to walk around report in

248
00:16:17,91 --> 00:16:20,17
and she'd organize the
supplies she was wonderful.

249
00:16:20,50 --> 00:16:22,67
She did that for about four days
then she walked out of the office.

250
00:16:22,74 --> 00:16:25,22
So when else picked up the task so

251
00:16:25,22 --> 00:16:30,26
that so the festival
maintenance work was kept on.

252
00:16:30,28 --> 00:16:33,13
I i also we had a free press.

253
00:16:34,90 --> 00:16:38,96
We had a lithographic press that used to
produce pamphlets at the back and people.

254
00:16:39,09 --> 00:16:43,05
Anyone can produce a
pamphlet. And distributed.

255
00:16:44,48 --> 00:16:47,95
Bush video with their in
theory videoing the festival

256
00:16:47,95 --> 00:16:52,01
and reducing the first cable network who
we got one monitor in a shop front by the

257
00:16:52,01 --> 00:16:56,11
end of the festival but they put
lots of interesting half in splash

258
00:16:56,11 --> 00:16:59,84
and white video was taken at the
time. Oh well one of the phenomena.

259
00:16:59,86 --> 00:17:03,09
I remember was that. Remember

260
00:17:03,09 --> 00:17:06,71
that one of the reasons for going to
neiman was to get away from the authority

261
00:17:06,71 --> 00:17:10,81
structures right now. I was
so into living in them.

262
00:17:12,24 --> 00:17:15,49
By the time the festival and
because we were dealing on.

263
00:17:15,75 --> 00:17:19,25
Sort of a personal basis with the
police and being totally open with us.

264
00:17:19,32 --> 00:17:24,45
I mean we struck a deal with the the head
of the cia fbi about drugs he came up to

265
00:17:24,45 --> 00:17:26,28
us and said this is how old.

266
00:17:26,31 --> 00:17:30,91
Frederick slated to be the mayor of this
more any said look i understand there are

267
00:17:30,91 --> 00:17:33,18
going to be drugs at this festival.

268
00:17:33,95 --> 00:17:37,25
I don't want to be embarrassed by the drugs
at this festival so keep them off the

269
00:17:37,25 --> 00:17:43,68
streets. So that was our pact that the
police wouldn't go into the fields.

270
00:17:43,70 --> 00:17:44,96
And arrest people for drugs

271
00:17:44,96 --> 00:17:48,58
and we'll make sure the drugs weren't
a part of the street scene in them.

272
00:17:50,25 --> 00:17:53,24
So i was finding the police very cooperative
because we've had the support of bob

273
00:17:53,24 --> 00:17:54,53
marsh and the local policeman.

274
00:17:55,87 --> 00:17:58,17
But as people arrive for the
festival from the university.

275
00:17:58,42 --> 00:18:02,02
You know like this is when the. First of
all began in earnest and the trains and.

276
00:18:02,28 --> 00:18:06,97
We had heard all these complaints from the
left wingers arriving who all they could

277
00:18:06,97 --> 00:18:10,97
see that arriving town all they
could see was policemen i say

278
00:18:10,98 --> 00:18:14,41
when i actually went down to a camp
of a particularly radical group

279
00:18:14,41 --> 00:18:18,32
and this is what they told us we thought
we thought we were coming to a free zone

280
00:18:18,32 --> 00:18:24,30
you know and we will be seen as police
everywhere. Police. I mean bob.

281
00:18:24,32 --> 00:18:29,55
It was a completely different vision. You
know. Having been part of the community.

282
00:18:31,99 --> 00:18:37,45
So to say about memories of the
festival. Apart from exhaustion.

283
00:18:38,48 --> 00:18:44,48
Yeah and this this this
issue of authority arose.

284
00:18:45,60 --> 00:18:49,71
Yes there was an arrest
and the situation was

285
00:18:49,71 --> 00:18:55,15
that the police had gone on
the site without telling us.

286
00:18:55,17 --> 00:19:01,56
And arrested a. Heroin
user. It was a smack.

287
00:19:01,64 --> 00:19:06,35
It's kind of prophetic too. We didn't believe
smack would come to the festival but.

288
00:19:06,86 --> 00:19:08,45
Smack it everywhere and out

289
00:19:09,88 --> 00:19:16,81
and as a ring the rest the up through

290
00:19:16,81 --> 00:19:20,04
through the festival like they
passed or coming up the road

291
00:19:20,04 --> 00:19:22,20
and it was only about 20 paces or 50.

292
00:19:22,73 --> 00:19:28,40
The most 50 metres from a soundstage
and people just ran to the soundstage

293
00:19:28,40 --> 00:19:30,57
and said it's a police bust you know.

294
00:19:31,09 --> 00:19:35,19
And the festival was so together as the
community like people just rose as one

295
00:19:35,19 --> 00:19:41,60
and ran to the police the paddy wagon
and liberated the the prisoner.

296
00:19:41,61 --> 00:19:48,51
And. In the in the melee a
policeman's gun was stolen.

297
00:19:48,53 --> 00:19:50,17
And.

298
00:19:50,19 --> 00:19:56,56
This of course hit a raw nerve we had the
situation of the media not knowing what

299
00:19:56,56 --> 00:19:59,49
this festival was about and
suddenly it. It had a story.

300
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:01,40
And it hit the afternoon dailies.

301
00:20:01,99 --> 00:20:07,54
In sydney as you know typical you
know hippies rioting and steel gun.

302
00:20:10,26 --> 00:20:13,99
So there was a lot of soul searching
that happened in the festival

303
00:20:13,99 --> 00:20:16,79
that time was a big meeting the
next day to talk about it.

304
00:20:19,32 --> 00:20:25,54
And there were a whole group of people who
wanted you know action taken against the

305
00:20:25,54 --> 00:20:29,33
police they wanted to march on the
playstation like kind of stuff

306
00:20:29,33 --> 00:20:34,51
and they interrupt our festival and there
are people who are suing for peace.

307
00:20:34,54 --> 00:20:39,28
You want the gun returned and the
thing forgotten not not forgotten.

308
00:20:39,82 --> 00:20:43,91
To go on with the intent of the festival
which was to discover a community to step

309
00:20:43,91 --> 00:20:48,28
in the future rather than to
slip back into antagonism

310
00:20:48,28 --> 00:20:50,38
and define the festival
in terms of opposition.

311
00:20:50,81 --> 00:20:57,60
Now the issue became increasingly urgent
because what the police response in sydney

312
00:20:57,60 --> 00:21:02,31
was to send up the twenty first division
which is of the tactical response squad

313
00:21:02,31 --> 00:21:03,41
that of the times.

314
00:21:03,51 --> 00:21:08,27
These were the policemen's policemen
they were there to bash people who bash

315
00:21:08,27 --> 00:21:12,50
placement basically and
they arrived in town.

316
00:21:14,04 --> 00:21:19,67
With the brief we soon became aware
to bust the festival. And within.

317
00:21:19,68 --> 00:21:22,48
Sort of an hour of arriving
in taking up duties in them

318
00:21:22,48 --> 00:21:25,63
and they were busting people in the main
street people who've been sitting you know.

319
00:21:26,09 --> 00:21:30,12
The festival this magical place where all
kinds of performance were having the

320
00:21:30,12 --> 00:21:30,39
street

321
00:21:30,39 --> 00:21:34,13
and people would sit around in the streets
of member not part of the magic of the

322
00:21:34,13 --> 00:21:37,98
festival on certainly the head of the
21st division was saying you have no more

323
00:21:37,98 --> 00:21:39,93
rights in the streets of them

324
00:21:39,93 --> 00:21:43,39
and you would have pitched rate if you sit
down in the street. You'll be arrested.

325
00:21:44,20 --> 00:21:45,82
What.

326
00:21:46,71 --> 00:21:53,42
Anyway we came clear to us that
something worse was happening. And.

327
00:21:53,44 --> 00:21:57,47
So i went down the police
station and demanded a meeting.

328
00:21:57,49 --> 00:21:59,58
Between the superintendent.

329
00:22:01,39 --> 00:22:03,12
There's more police the regional police

330
00:22:03,12 --> 00:22:04,42
and the head of the twenty first division

331
00:22:05,23 --> 00:22:10,02
and the people from i guess so the meeting
was set for 6:00 pm that evening.

332
00:22:10,53 --> 00:22:13,19
And this is the first day the
twenty first division were in town

333
00:22:14,82 --> 00:22:20,04
and we thought we'd be clever. If we had a
local person there. This would be wise.

334
00:22:20,07 --> 00:22:23,98
So we invited. Dave smith. To come the
property owner i mentioned before.

335
00:22:25,09 --> 00:22:27,32
Quite apart from being
an old name and family.

336
00:22:28,82 --> 00:22:35,20
They was also the organiser for the
country party in the area. So we invited.

337
00:22:36,33 --> 00:22:38,47
They have to come to the meeting which
took place in the police station

338
00:22:39,23 --> 00:22:42,12
and we sat around and i remembered.
Johnny allen with his long hair.

339
00:22:42,56 --> 00:22:46,89
Poncho with a headband and a u.s.

340
00:22:46,89 --> 00:22:50,78
President and the administrative officer

341
00:22:50,78 --> 00:22:57,11
and dave smith talking to these two senior
policeman who can only say you have no

342
00:22:57,11 --> 00:22:58,52
special rights if you break the law.

343
00:22:58,66 --> 00:23:02,77
We have to act on it but this time the
gun and then returned by the way.

344
00:23:03,40 --> 00:23:06,75
And.

345
00:23:06,76 --> 00:23:07,85
We talk and talk and get

346
00:23:07,85 --> 00:23:10,46
and i was like talking to because
these guys weren't going to budge.

347
00:23:10,70 --> 00:23:15,94
They were going to bust the
festival this was their aim and.

348
00:23:15,96 --> 00:23:19,78
Eventually we asked dave
smith and said dave.

349
00:23:19,90 --> 00:23:22,17
What do you think about this you know.

350
00:23:23,48 --> 00:23:27,76
We think if the police go onto the field
tonight when you know there'll be mayhem.

351
00:23:28,01 --> 00:23:31,19
There are lots of kids in
this crowd and you'll have.

352
00:23:31,49 --> 00:23:32,64
Stampedes and people like this

353
00:23:33,39 --> 00:23:39,54
and they smith reply was a classic he
said i think if you go into the crowds

354
00:23:39,54 --> 00:23:43,44
tonight if you go into the fields.
There'll be property damage.

355
00:23:44,63 --> 00:23:47,12
And it just went clunk right.

356
00:23:47,30 --> 00:23:49,15
Both policemen realize

357
00:23:49,15 --> 00:23:53,98
that if they did what they were planning
to do they would have some local farmer

358
00:23:53,98 --> 00:23:59,84
saying we told them not to on
television. So they went. And.

359
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,20
Ok i will review the situation tomorrow.

360
00:24:04,22 --> 00:24:08,82
So we stepped outside of this meeting
and in the yard of the first place.

361
00:24:08,84 --> 00:24:10,36
Station this by this time it was dark.

362
00:24:10,53 --> 00:24:14,92
Where at least 60 uniformed police
waiting for their instructions

363
00:24:14,92 --> 00:24:19,40
that they'd rosted people on from all
around the place this mighty task force it

364
00:24:19,40 --> 00:24:23,68
was going to do over the first
of all and it was averted.

365
00:24:24,75 --> 00:24:28,39
Not only didn't they raid the.

366
00:24:29,15 --> 00:24:31,65
The festival go into the
fields and arrest people

367
00:24:31,65 --> 00:24:38,33
that night they became the 21st division
sort of kind of melted as an aggressive

368
00:24:38,33 --> 00:24:42,39
force and they became part of the
festival and they were challenged.

369
00:24:43,47 --> 00:24:45,47
There was a sports day on the
last saturday of the festival

370
00:24:46,56 --> 00:24:50,87
and they were challenged to be part of the
tug of war team against the hippies the

371
00:24:50,87 --> 00:24:55,22
twenty first division verses the hippies
now like they did they didn't except in

372
00:24:55,23 --> 00:25:00,02
the end however they accepted in good faith
and and people talked in the streets

373
00:25:00,02 --> 00:25:02,06
and they were just another
aspect of the festival

374
00:25:03,33 --> 00:25:08,58
and talking at the police after the
festival there was at a party.

375
00:25:09,54 --> 00:25:13,15
I guess i saw a party organized
by the police themselves over it.

376
00:25:13,15 --> 00:25:14,95
I think they are same club and casino.

377
00:25:15,25 --> 00:25:18,79
But it was basically the people who worked
on the on the cuirassier still getting

378
00:25:18,79 --> 00:25:23,35
together to have a drink
before they split up and.

379
00:25:23,36 --> 00:25:26,20
Some of the people who worked on
the festival went heard about it

380
00:25:26,20 --> 00:25:29,24
and went over there certainly could
be part of it neatly that tribute

381
00:25:29,24 --> 00:25:32,88
or guys who had stablish good report with
the place in the time not living in them

382
00:25:32,88 --> 00:25:37,49
and then played songs to them
in all this kind of stuff and.

383
00:25:37,51 --> 00:25:40,83
In the course of this they reported back
to us that what the police had to say.

384
00:25:40,90 --> 00:25:43,64
Were they were amazed right and the thing

385
00:25:43,64 --> 00:25:48,25
that amazed me most was the
number of police spies.

386
00:25:48,27 --> 00:25:53,34
He said there were people from the
f.b.i. People from the special school.

387
00:25:53,44 --> 00:25:54,34
There are people from

388
00:25:54,34 --> 00:25:58,49
and they would come to the police station
right to identify themselves to us

389
00:25:58,49 --> 00:25:59,26
because they had information.

390
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,38
And they would be the most wacky weirdest
dressed people you ever so they were more

391
00:26:05,38 --> 00:26:09,51
weird than the hippies right.

392
00:26:09,53 --> 00:26:12,48
Up with a nice try.

393
00:26:12,49 --> 00:26:18,80
I don't know the place
will ever tell that story.

394
00:26:18,82 --> 00:26:24,76
Well after all. After the first of all
the university students went back.

395
00:26:24,82 --> 00:26:29,05
I mean the bulk of the festival was made
up of university students so they went

396
00:26:29,05 --> 00:26:30,13
back to do the courses

397
00:26:31,22 --> 00:26:35,65
and back at university these debates arose
these meetings were held on the campuses

398
00:26:35,65 --> 00:26:38,83
certainly sydney university and
university of new south wales after name

399
00:26:38,83 --> 00:26:44,25
and what right because people had
had such a profoundly moving time

400
00:26:44,25 --> 00:26:46,09
that they'd been touched in so many ways

401
00:26:46,09 --> 00:26:47,78
and minded being open to
so many possibilities

402
00:26:48,95 --> 00:26:52,92
that they were seriously examining their
university careers their courses.

403
00:26:53,13 --> 00:26:55,44
While most telling. This is
not relevant to the future

404
00:26:56,17 --> 00:26:59,40
and their careers 100 do with themselves
lot of people complaining dropping out

405
00:26:59,40 --> 00:27:02,71
and going to the lab so.

406
00:27:03,96 --> 00:27:08,89
The university students went back
a lot and did personal searches.

407
00:27:08,90 --> 00:27:12,46
Other people who are high energy people
who contributed to the festival also left

408
00:27:12,46 --> 00:27:14,65
town. This is a phenomenon

409
00:27:14,65 --> 00:27:20,56
that people with vision energy the doers
of the world usually have projects on the

410
00:27:20,56 --> 00:27:26,97
boil. So like they didn't hang around
after the festival which left.

411
00:27:26,99 --> 00:27:31,42
Left in nimbin the flotsam and jetsam that
the people who are drifting into town.

412
00:27:32,73 --> 00:27:33,99
And.

413
00:27:34,76 --> 00:27:37,06
Were looking for a place looking for
someone to look after them looking for a

414
00:27:37,06 --> 00:27:41,00
structure to live in now
that the tangible force.

415
00:27:41,58 --> 00:27:42,71
Cooperative had been launched by

416
00:27:42,71 --> 00:27:46,41
that time so there was a bit of an
infrastructure coming together encouraging

417
00:27:46,42 --> 00:27:50,43
people to hang around the $200 were going
to buy this land which is 13 kilometers

418
00:27:50,43 --> 00:27:53,84
out of town but that took a
long time to come online

419
00:27:53,84 --> 00:27:59,05
or something like six months so there
was a kind of a desperate period

420
00:27:59,05 --> 00:28:01,64
that followed after this. Still
lots of people hanging on.

421
00:28:02,47 --> 00:28:06,39
I also had the job of doing the cleanup
of the site because i was responsible for

422
00:28:06,39 --> 00:28:09,57
most of the borrowing and
negotiations to get the sites

423
00:28:10,61 --> 00:28:17,19
and i had this terrible job
because people had built lots of.

424
00:28:17,90 --> 00:28:21,69
Shanties they go to mass sticks
and twigs and bits of plastic

425
00:28:21,69 --> 00:28:22,89
and all this kind of stuff.

426
00:28:22,99 --> 00:28:26,55
Some of them quite substantial wood and

427
00:28:28,16 --> 00:28:29,63
and there's a call from
the tangible people

428
00:28:29,63 --> 00:28:34,93
that we should recycle as much of the
timber useful materials as possible so we

429
00:28:34,93 --> 00:28:39,09
were dismantling things but as
we went on. That's how it began.

430
00:28:39,28 --> 00:28:44,42
Anyway but what happened was i go to
shanty the shoulders of being built and

431
00:28:45,47 --> 00:28:48,60
and to be someone living in it.
I'd say look. First it was over.

432
00:28:48,73 --> 00:28:53,95
Got to leave the site were
returning the site and.

433
00:28:53,97 --> 00:28:55,35
I've got to pull this thing

434
00:28:55,35 --> 00:28:58,78
and i say are don't pull down
the day it would stay overnight

435
00:28:58,78 --> 00:29:01,56
and leave town tomorrow. So
please leave it as i go.

436
00:29:01,89 --> 00:29:04,90
And i go back the next day and
if someone different in it.

437
00:29:04,96 --> 00:29:07,17
Those people live but
someone different moved in

438
00:29:07,17 --> 00:29:08,80
and they had exactly the same story.

439
00:29:09,64 --> 00:29:13,20
I was in a totally frustrated with the
track because these are mushroom acres

440
00:29:13,20 --> 00:29:18,97
basically these are people hanging around
having russian troops which i quite enjoy

441
00:29:18,97 --> 00:29:21,04
a mushroom trip with self so i can
understand what they're on about

442
00:29:21,76 --> 00:29:24,43
but they were certainly not
helping with the cleanup.

443
00:29:24,45 --> 00:29:28,58
And it was just coming down to a
few of us doing the dirty work

444
00:29:29,78 --> 00:29:31,70
and i was getting more and
i was exhausted again.

445
00:29:32,03 --> 00:29:35,09
I had really bad side pains
i was getting very short

446
00:29:36,03 --> 00:29:39,69
and by the end of the workers walking around
was a big stick and a boxing matches.

447
00:29:39,98 --> 00:29:45,27
If i found shelter empty. I would move
the possessions out and set fire to it.

448
00:29:47,68 --> 00:29:50,36
And if everyone approached me
complaining i would wave my stick

449
00:29:50,36 --> 00:29:54,26
and say the festival was over.
So so much for peace and love.

450
00:29:56,85 --> 00:29:59,50
So it was a very difficult job. Just.

451
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,87
At the the whole handle
them of energy shifted.

452
00:30:04,20 --> 00:30:07,95
After the first of all the good
energy went off to do something

453
00:30:08,81 --> 00:30:12,41
and all the people who were hanging around
waiting for things to be done for them.

454
00:30:13,58 --> 00:30:18,19
Remained on. Not all. I mean
for a substantial number.

455
00:30:18,98 --> 00:30:25,95
I remember for example before i closed
up the office. One of the guys coming.

456
00:30:25,97 --> 00:30:30,22
Well i can't aquarius.
I mean two of brush.

457
00:30:31,84 --> 00:30:35,33
Aquarius is just lost a lot
of money on his birthday.

458
00:30:35,34 --> 00:30:38,32
I think we lost something like twenty
thousand dollars or something a bit.

459
00:30:38,45 --> 00:30:41,46
Well over budget but we felt no.

460
00:30:41,48 --> 00:30:44,79
I'm not in the business of supplying
hippies with toothbrushes.

461
00:30:45,88 --> 00:30:50,42
But that was a kind of attitude so.

462
00:30:50,44 --> 00:30:53,17
I did like i just got to just comment.

463
00:30:53,38 --> 00:31:00,04
The tide went out we went from this ecstatic
high together to get sparrows in the

464
00:31:00,04 --> 00:31:01,83
streets wondering what was going to happen

465
00:31:01,83 --> 00:31:04,90
and they had no doorway i think the
support and so they really cling.

466
00:31:05,14 --> 00:31:06,52
There are a number of houses

467
00:31:06,52 --> 00:31:12,17
that people had rented before the festival
which became such for people to leave.

468
00:31:12,93 --> 00:31:15,32
But that basically.

469
00:31:15,33 --> 00:31:18,69
Then the people who are organising the
tangible co-operative went down to sydney to

470
00:31:18,69 --> 00:31:22,72
do the organising there
was no structure in them.

471
00:31:24,28 --> 00:31:29,33
So i i moved to armidale
as my partner and that.
