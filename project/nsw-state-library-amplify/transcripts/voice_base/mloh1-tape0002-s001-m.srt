00:00:06,84 --> 00:00:09,17

4
00:00:09,17 --> 00:00:15,47
a design engineer mainly on the approaches
to the bridge the approaches from

5
00:00:17,18 --> 00:00:23,89
and to the bridge and then from the bridge
to when your station. The part that was

6
00:00:23,89 --> 00:00:29,18
done by day labor the public work
supervising that's correct. And how long we

7
00:00:29,18 --> 00:00:35,87
working the deed a period of six years.
Do you member of getting the job. I do as

8
00:00:35,87 --> 00:00:42,03
a matter of fact i recently came over
from victoria for a holiday and i've had

9
00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:47,41
a holiday ever since being thirty five years
with the public works and they're tied

10
00:00:47,41 --> 00:00:48,88
for twenty what i'm having

11
00:00:48,88 --> 00:00:52,86
a good time they're better god never
do you remember getting the job who

12
00:00:52,86 --> 00:00:57,64
interviewed you was it terms to talk
about real. Now and fortunately they had

13
00:00:57,64 --> 00:01:02,71
a great time for him and i think all his
staff were magnificent taught him and they

14
00:01:02,71 --> 00:01:06,04
treated him so. I was interviewed by mr.

15
00:01:06,04 --> 00:01:10,17
Gordon stuckey who was here today.
Gordon and i have had quite

16
00:01:10,17 --> 00:01:15,37
a good yarn about what we did
in those days he finished up as

17
00:01:15,37 --> 00:01:20,70
a consulting engineer and i met him out
of various occasions past history kenja

18
00:01:20,70 --> 00:01:25,41
their public works at bathurst. Do you
remember any stories about when he worked on

19
00:01:25,41 --> 00:01:29,91
the bridge. Well i don't know i've had so
many stories that are probably for his

20
00:01:29,91 --> 00:01:32,86
time i don't think about
the whole lot but it's

21
00:01:32,86 --> 00:01:37,86
a very enjoyable time and i can
assure you we're all worship dr.

22
00:01:37,86 --> 00:01:43,29
Bradfield for what he was to us and what
he actually did he was our model in all

23
00:01:43,29 --> 00:01:48,78
directions. Can you think of any funny
stories about him or any serious ones when

24
00:01:48,78 --> 00:01:55,15
it. Talked about we would have various
areas in many respects but he used to pick

25
00:01:55,15 --> 00:02:01,50
us for our particular jobs. One of the
main jobs is to pick on me for was to help

26
00:02:01,50 --> 00:02:07,74
some of the photographers around mainly
taking movies of the work i was the only

27
00:02:07,74 --> 00:02:09,69
one apparently in the office could handle

28
00:02:09,69 --> 00:02:16,62
a tripod for that particular photographer.
Remember the photographers. I can't

29
00:02:16,62 --> 00:02:20,08
recall but the main the
main photographer was

30
00:02:20,08 --> 00:02:26,69
a kind and they went. He all his work.
I think has been taken over by the

31
00:02:26,69 --> 00:02:31,03
institution of engineers astray. It was
robert bowden and there was bill brindle

32
00:02:31,03 --> 00:02:36,69
here as well robert brown took mainly the
steals their other power. He took most of

33
00:02:36,69 --> 00:02:42,18
the movies especially in detail. Didn't win
any of those movies are now i think the

34
00:02:42,18 --> 00:02:48,21
institution of engineers have to how a lot
of them. I think you are much. I've got

35
00:02:48,21 --> 00:02:49,93
a bit of noise going on
inside and there soon.
