1
00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:26,62
Identification. This is tape one side too. And will continue in about ten seconds time.

2
00:00:29,41 --> 00:00:32,43
So my mother had a Scottish hang ups.

3
00:00:33,15 --> 00:00:53,95
And my great grandmother came from Scotland and she married the man who him the employers brought. Groomsmen.

4
00:00:53,97 --> 00:01:04,43
Great host most horsemen looked after the horses. So the groomsmen and the sea stress married.

5
00:01:04,89 --> 00:01:14,26
And as a result of that came Mark. Who was. SCOTTISH it wasn't family.

6
00:01:14,87 --> 00:01:26,53
But it was his combination of Indian and Scottish beautiful. Just so beautiful. My grandmother my mother's mother.

7
00:01:27,54 --> 00:01:38,42
She lived. Now where she lived before that I never knew. I only remember being taken. They are often Christmas time.

8
00:01:39,66 --> 00:01:45,35
With my three sisters and my mother for Christmas holidays. And she owned the house she lived.

9
00:01:45,86 --> 00:01:51,18
In a street called Happened St The Albion response.

10
00:01:52,23 --> 00:02:00,9
And she had mango tree in the peach tree and trucks in the backyard if you please and neighbors

11
00:02:00,9 --> 00:02:07,31
and I were all very closely knit. And this I would say would say ten minutes from the heart of the city a person.

12
00:02:09,28 --> 00:02:15,06
And she lived there but. Lack of a Sunday morning when you were there. Grandma.

13
00:02:15,46 --> 00:02:21,99
Would get dressed in beautiful clothes you'd folks of beautiful.

14
00:02:23,5 --> 00:02:33,54
Japs blouses and silks and beautiful black billets and her hair would be massed on the top of it

15
00:02:33,54 --> 00:02:41,35
and she'd pick up her bottle and him book and she walked down happened straight like the Queen of Australia

16
00:02:42,18 --> 00:02:49,82
and turned into the next street up to her Church Anglican Church and she'd go to the morning service.

17
00:02:49,83 --> 00:03:01,55
Every Sunday of the year. So when we were there. She'd often take me with her. You know and this grandmother.

18
00:03:01,93 --> 00:03:16,91
She had and she was a woman with. Grace and. A glorious voice a magnificent force and she had one of the.

19
00:03:16,93 --> 00:03:19,83
Grandma phones that you wear.

20
00:03:19,84 --> 00:03:28,4
And that had a great big speaker a huge speaker His Master's Voice speaker and it sat in the corner of a shrew.

21
00:03:28,88 --> 00:03:42,14
And I had she had discs This was before the plastic discs came about. And she had sung with Caruso.

22
00:03:42,16 --> 00:03:46,7
That I'm nearly Melva are and Dame Clay are about

23
00:03:47,92 --> 00:03:56,25
and it was wonderful on a Saturday night in that house because that would be the night we'd all get in the Landrieu.

24
00:03:57,41 --> 00:04:05,76
And she played that for us. With these voices.

25
00:04:05,78 --> 00:04:11,05
And we all gather around and she'd ask us to sing and she'd sing with the singers you know.

26
00:04:12,85 --> 00:04:16,97
Absolutely beautiful and that was the happiest day that my mother grew up in

27
00:04:18,2 --> 00:04:27,79
and your grandfather did you ever knew him he was family killed by a horse. Crossing a flooded river.

28
00:04:29,04 --> 00:04:32,75
And I'm not quite sure what happened but he didn't survive

29
00:04:32,75 --> 00:04:38,35
and sadly I never knew him because by the time we were going to my grandmother's house.

30
00:04:38,7 --> 00:04:43,97
My grandmother had married again. And she would actually married a man from the.

31
00:04:43,99 --> 00:04:51,44
Hints the mango tree in the backyard and little cluster of banana tree. That he was a mad gambler.

32
00:04:52,15 --> 00:04:54,89
And she used to have to hide money from him.

33
00:04:55,85 --> 00:05:07,72
Now she was quite an independent woman and the laundry for the ladies of Clayfield. And very good money for the day.

34
00:05:09,94 --> 00:05:13,74
So my mother saw this and my mother saw how to keep her house

35
00:05:13,74 --> 00:05:17,68
and she saw that you didn't sit down to a bed table to eat from.

36
00:05:18,11 --> 00:05:24,09
And she saw that come with my you didn't drink tea out of Mark or pemmican.

37
00:05:24,77 --> 00:05:36,4
And you hung on to good china even if you both wanted capital. And there was no roughing it and that's almost about it.

38
00:05:37,69 --> 00:05:48,13
You know what I'm asked about my mother much detail about this extraordinary woman. Quite beautiful.

39
00:05:48,15 --> 00:05:57,43
Which of course as I was growing up and saw of that I remember it being polite.

40
00:05:58,65 --> 00:06:10,5
And it was very Indian like and had hung right there and she could sit on it actually. And she had Theory long.

41
00:06:13,4 --> 00:06:26,91
Beautiful huge Brown back in his high for very high far and. And her hands. The most beautiful hands.

42
00:06:26,93 --> 00:06:32,01
And I always remember looking at her hands like every Sunday.

43
00:06:32,19 --> 00:06:38,34
Come what may she would make a plum pudding for dinner with Day dinner.

44
00:06:38,36 --> 00:06:44,68
And she'd stand at the head of the table with a huge plum put in the next few.

45
00:06:44,7 --> 00:06:59,44
And with her beautiful hand she'd slice a piece and later dressed list. And another. Look at these thank you. Cliff.

46
00:07:02,09 --> 00:07:07,88
At the machine and have five fingers were like it's part of the needle of the machine.

47
00:07:07,89 --> 00:07:17,59
It was beautiful just beautiful and so she had all of these all graces that her mother.

48
00:07:17,61 --> 00:07:28,18
And she was a singer to your mother my mother had the most beautiful forests. I cannot tell you. And she used bloody.

49
00:07:28,19 --> 00:07:32,38
From when she got up out of bed in the morning until she went to bed at night

50
00:07:32,38 --> 00:07:41,95
and she never stopped singing all day whether it was over the tub. Over the bowl of flour.

51
00:07:42,8 --> 00:07:49,41
What if she was doing she would be singing. And you would hear her also.

52
00:07:49,43 --> 00:07:58,98
In the country this beautiful voice coming out of the mountains as it were. And every night without exception.

53
00:08:00,29 --> 00:08:05,8
Except Sunday night of course we were all expected to sit down and sing with her.

54
00:08:06,94 --> 00:08:19,59
And I remember clearly when I'm nearly. Mother sitting on the front steps we lost a sister.

55
00:08:19,61 --> 00:08:27,27
And lighter of course in the Depression when all the American songs came into Australia like black bird

56
00:08:27,27 --> 00:08:33,07
and all of that she wouldn't allow us to sing that. There was no rubbish in my house.

57
00:08:37,59 --> 00:08:41,58
How did she know when he actually made it was in was it COULD YOU are.

58
00:08:41,59 --> 00:08:50,44
Yes well like first husband about whom we knew very little because she no one would ever speak about it.

59
00:08:52,39 --> 00:08:57,51
For some reason or other she'd heard that there were a lot of island women. In coaching.

60
00:08:57,97 --> 00:09:02,37
And she'd probably go and find comfort.

61
00:09:02,92 --> 00:09:11,11
Because she has she got there I don't know but she appeared in could you know with these two little girls.

62
00:09:12,24 --> 00:09:22,73
And there was a church. And my father used which you probably would go into the pulpit and preach.

63
00:09:22,75 --> 00:09:29,32
And there was a local white preacher on and.

64
00:09:30,03 --> 00:09:36,76
He was called the reform and he lived next door to the church with his wife

65
00:09:37,77 --> 00:09:47,67
and his wife taught a couple of the women how to play the organ. And he didn't mean to go into his pulpit.

66
00:09:48,08 --> 00:09:58,25
After all they built the church and take the service. And I think it was say that my mother met my father.

67
00:09:58,26 --> 00:10:06,13
And they had a big splash and the alan for women not the chokes up but it doesn't.

68
00:10:07,09 --> 00:10:19,51
And the member of the hams the yams and the terror. And she often described the wedding breakfast. And Bill.

69
00:10:20,29 --> 00:10:30,33
Tables with the legs in the ground and covered with white the mask. If you place. And it was a great waiting.

70
00:10:30,54 --> 00:10:39,91
My mother had regretfully. No one even took a photograph of it. So I think my mother met my.

71
00:10:40,92 --> 00:10:52,96
Anyhow he didn't get an opportunity. To to give up his. But someone said to him. Well Peter.

72
00:10:52,98 --> 00:11:09,32
You know that was his English name and he was always called Peter Peter you come to terms as good as he like you share.

73
00:11:10,88 --> 00:11:27,93
And happened that I was both little bolder. And you were in fact one of eight. I was one of eight. There were four.

74
00:11:27,94 --> 00:11:36,26
And then. And ten months after the birth of the last girl my father died.

75
00:11:36,98 --> 00:11:46,37
But I want to just tell you about this house that was unique.

76
00:11:48,42 --> 00:11:55,54
I was born in that house we were all born in that house a couple of. My father got to share.

77
00:11:55,55 --> 00:11:58,07
With a very good honest man.

78
00:11:59,06 --> 00:12:06,23
And every morning he left and he went up into the mountains with us and he would work all day

79
00:12:06,23 --> 00:12:12,86
and come down in the evening but sometimes when the but now we're not. And they didn't need attention.

80
00:12:13,34 --> 00:12:16,79
He'd get other jobs around the place for the local farmers.

81
00:12:16,83 --> 00:12:26,87
So there was not a great income but sufficient for us to have good nourishing food and warm clothes.

82
00:12:26,89 --> 00:12:43,78
So the father got this in with the. Quite power. And. I think you into it that. And the what day.

83
00:12:43,8 --> 00:12:50,46
He put me on his shoulders carry me to the top of the mountain with a.

84
00:12:50,48 --> 00:12:57,31
And it was a packing share with it but honors were packed and he'd give me a little small hammer

85
00:12:57,31 --> 00:12:58,8
and show me how to make the.

86
00:12:59,39 --> 00:13:04,68
But now and i cases which were packed in which would be sent off to me

87
00:13:05,59 --> 00:13:09,87
and I'd work with him like this in the Atlanta shit.

88
00:13:09,89 --> 00:13:17,21
I'd stay there all day with him and whatever and he'd go a little bit later.

89
00:13:18,38 --> 00:13:31,74
And sit there with all the other main who would be working there. And then. Late afternoon again and. The steep hill.

90
00:13:33,08 --> 00:13:41,89
To the house. The first thing that would happen is that. My mother would bring about all of warm water lifeboat.

91
00:13:42,54 --> 00:13:58,49
And a towel. And we wash our train ourselves. For the evening meal. Yeah. And they were always good nourishing meal.

92
00:13:59,14 --> 00:14:11,62
Not flesh but always made everything was made. The brain. Great to use with masses of vegetables in the evening.

93
00:14:13,21 --> 00:14:20,16
The bait dinners were always kept for Sunday. So that house.

94
00:14:20,91 --> 00:14:32,46
It was very humble only the barest of furniture but we were all born in that house and the midwife whose name was Emma.

95
00:14:32,48 --> 00:14:41,11
Always came a fortnight before my mother was ready to have the behavior. And she delivered me.

96
00:14:42,37 --> 00:14:51,34
I think she made a good nothing wrong with me except to say I am one vertebrae short.

97
00:14:51,36 --> 00:14:58,92
But I recall this midwife coming from my younger sister. And she would arrive.

98
00:14:59,24 --> 00:15:09,62
And she do arise with an omelette biscuit tin full of homemade biscuits. She was Irish to the marrow of her.

99
00:15:09,64 --> 00:15:16,9
And she came from. The county of. CLARE.

100
00:15:17,01 --> 00:15:21,61
I think she's forgotten but she often talked about it

101
00:15:22,75 --> 00:15:29,35
and she was actually married to a person who came from the Arlen's and that was how we got to know.

102
00:15:30,51 --> 00:15:37,3
So she'd come and install herself a fortnight before the baby would come. And when she wasn't looking.

103
00:15:37,49 --> 00:15:43,26
We pinch homemade biscuits now and again. But the old horrible cheap biscuits.

104
00:15:43,56 --> 00:15:47,33
She'd leave in a place that was very available.

105
00:15:47,35 --> 00:15:52,19
And the homemade ones who kept for my mother you see afternoon tea and morning tea

106
00:15:52,99 --> 00:16:01,24
and very few mothers today would have had the care that my mother had before the baby. She was wonderful.

107
00:16:01,58 --> 00:16:11,59
She'd get my mother walking in the late afternoon. Slowly in the open green fields. And talk and she'd bring her.

108
00:16:12,56 --> 00:16:30,00
And wash. Put it to bed. And then take her in the evening lino. Paint a picture of a very happy secure childhood.

109
00:16:30,01 --> 00:16:37,2
At that time it was very secure. While my father's was there I always felt very secure.

110
00:16:41,81 --> 00:17:00,67
School Incidentally I must tell you about school. So the stories of course would go on around the fire at night.

111
00:17:00,85 --> 00:17:08,35
But my mother always maintained that her kitchen should be as English as her cooking.

112
00:17:09,15 --> 00:17:22,31
Roast beef roast chicken roast protect it all a problem for us and she'd been crazy. Tablecloths almost at about it.

113
00:17:23,56 --> 00:17:32,11
Anyhow. No more sense of secure a great sense of security in those early years of my.

114
00:17:32,13 --> 00:17:39,79
I suppose we would have been considered quite poor. But everyone around us was poor.

115
00:17:39,8 --> 00:17:44,43
All our neighbors were Irish family.

116
00:17:44,44 --> 00:17:51,17
And there was one family that lived even more so in the bush than we were by the name of Cox

117
00:17:52,57 --> 00:18:04,57
and they had a tribe of kids too. But I had files on a very large scale kept looks so when at York's weren't lying.

118
00:18:04,59 --> 00:18:11,78
They supply us with eggs. And we'd supply them with vegetables. So there was a lot.

119
00:18:11,83 --> 00:18:18,61
Cooperation and support a lot of the community was quite close it was a very closely knit community

120
00:18:18,61 --> 00:18:28,4
and we were part of it. We were part of it. There was a fire that had a great theory. And he gave us milk.

121
00:18:30,28 --> 00:18:39,42
Then there was another fan of wife made great tomato sauce and she'd give us tomato sauce and homemade cakes

122
00:18:39,42 --> 00:18:47,00
and we'd give them fruit and vegetables though there was a lot of went on at that time and that in three

123
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:52,00
and three was before the Great Depression. And so we all went to school together.

124
00:18:54,06 --> 00:18:59,75
Not all because there were some of the farmers who stuck to being Catholic

125
00:18:59,75 --> 00:19:05,73
and the children kept exco which was away from the local village

126
00:19:06,62 --> 00:19:13,59
but those who were Protestants would come to our house first and pick us up

127
00:19:13,59 --> 00:19:20,18
and then we'd go off all on horses some I think should and.

128
00:19:20,2 --> 00:19:29,4
It was just marvelous the worst preparation for your horse at the school problem. And to get there. We had to cross.

129
00:19:29,42 --> 00:19:30,87
By ferry.

130
00:19:31,74 --> 00:19:38,63
And it was always so exciting and the ferry man was lovely lovely always full of fun

131
00:19:38,63 --> 00:19:49,25
and he'd give Marcos a pinch you know to make it a kind of thing but you know I want to say that this is one hundred

132
00:19:49,25 --> 00:20:00,34
and fifty three. What is the school where is it and the school is the local primary school at. This village.

133
00:20:00,56 --> 00:20:07,18
It's a little township now and I'm thinking.

134
00:20:07,2 --> 00:20:11,36
If I have the strength to go up for the university but if not I'll write to.

135
00:20:11,83 --> 00:20:26,85
I went there as a child to have taken elder sister. And sometimes we just used the one horse you know.

136
00:20:26,87 --> 00:20:36,2
Two of us on a one horse. And my teacher's name was Miss Gracie and she'd come from England.

137
00:20:36,69 --> 00:20:45,21
Q My lips just marvelous and she told me that I had to learn how to dance.

138
00:20:46,72 --> 00:20:55,02
So she'd come to school with a portable gramophone make you wound up and she'd bring beautiful.

139
00:20:55,04 --> 00:21:06,36
Strauss records and she'd take us to the local church hall twice a week two afternoons. And teach us how to waltz.

140
00:21:07,55 --> 00:21:16,72
And I remember on one occasion I had socks in the full of holes and I kept bending down to try and.

141
00:21:16,73 --> 00:21:23,93
The holes of my socks you see and she said to me off. It's much better with your bare feet.

142
00:21:25,94 --> 00:21:30,83
And I could live so those two afternoons of dancing.

143
00:21:30,85 --> 00:21:35,04
Because of course later on you became a professional dancer for a while. Didn't you.

144
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:50,13
I've always loved dancing and I think that's the thing I miss most to this very day in my life. To this very day.

145
00:21:50,98 --> 00:22:01,89
I would go dancing every night of the week. If I had someone to go with. So that was always good.

146
00:22:02,19 --> 00:22:11,78
I learned how to read and how to writers and. You know almost to be you know about five or six. Six.

147
00:22:12,08 --> 00:22:17,99
And I was quite independent I could read. I could read Little Red Riding-Hood.

148
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:24,79
The three years and all of those books quite independently of my mother and my sisters.

149
00:22:24,81 --> 00:22:32,74
And I had to read them over and over and over again but of course when I started school my father had.

150
00:22:32,75 --> 00:22:36,59
And I was no longer getting the story.

151
00:22:36,61 --> 00:22:46,46
And it was necessary for me to supplement a little I knew what happens doing but I had that need first story.

152
00:22:46,48 --> 00:22:48,23
How do you when your father died.

153
00:22:51,76 --> 00:23:02,37
I think I was five or six and my youngest sister was only ten months so I want to tell you about this day.

154
00:23:02,39 --> 00:23:14,54
Many many of the main who were brought from the. Flu. And it was very difficult for them to pull through.

155
00:23:16,02 --> 00:23:24,15
And my father came home one evening from work. And it was in the month of July.

156
00:23:25,28 --> 00:23:37,4
And he didn't feel way out my mother put him to bed. And the next day he was really very.

157
00:23:37,41 --> 00:23:48,51
And his white partner came and wondered where he. Came out I can always remember him coming with a basket of eggs.

158
00:23:50,18 --> 00:23:59,87
My mother taking. Taking her him into the bedroom. This must have gone on for a few days.

159
00:24:01,47 --> 00:24:11,78
And he wasn't doing any better. He was coughing very badly. The family came again and his wife and forty things.

160
00:24:12,96 --> 00:24:21,33
Do you think we ought to call an ambulance to take him to hospital thanks. And she went in the ambulance with him.

161
00:24:22,82 --> 00:24:43,19
To the hospital which was seven miles away at the time. And she stayed there with him and we looked after each other.

162
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:49,16
And some very kind person drove him the next day.

163
00:24:51,28 --> 00:24:57,91
I don't remember how long he was there but I recall her taking me to see him.

164
00:24:57,93 --> 00:25:11,54
And he was very low in health and she said and she had me. And he said to always look after this.

165
00:25:11,59 --> 00:25:20,34
Well and I didn't quite remember him saying that

166
00:25:20,34 --> 00:25:26,69
but to this day I have a sister who told me that that's what he would almost look after this one.

167
00:25:28,62 --> 00:25:37,71
And it seemed that after she'd taken me. It may have been the day after or something like that.

168
00:25:38,92 --> 00:25:53,75
And I was in the whole community. He'd become very loved. And you see our place had become a great.

169
00:25:53,76 --> 00:26:03,54
Many of those aren't main who had come down so after a new life came to us on a Sunday in particular

170
00:26:03,54 --> 00:26:13,68
and they were priests. You know as kids we were sent up to knock over a dozen or so. Trucks.

171
00:26:13,69 --> 00:26:23,36
And we'd help cook them in the big camp opens for the Sunday feast. So you can understand what he said he was leaving.

172
00:26:24,01 --> 00:26:40,19
Greatly missed. He'd been seen as a sort of elder in a way. Had he. He was one of the very few min men who married.

173
00:26:40,21 --> 00:26:50,59
And having done that he put down very deep roots. And because he did a bit of preaching in the church. I think he was.

174
00:26:52,08 --> 00:26:54,87
A rock.

175
00:26:55,67 --> 00:27:00,52
And so these people came and they came when I were well and I came when they were sick

176
00:27:00,52 --> 00:27:05,7
and I always knew that would scare the loving care and I always knew that

177
00:27:05,7 --> 00:27:19,29
when they were well they would always be a good singsong. Like when Sunday Sunday morning would come early.

178
00:27:19,31 --> 00:27:26,11
And here my mother would get into Purcell with a beautiful horse and ask kids would get into the spring.

179
00:27:26,75 --> 00:27:33,69
And we'd all be taken to this church that they built. At Terra Nova. Just off the Queensland border.

180
00:27:35,75 --> 00:27:42,62
And usually a couple of boys would be left at home to keep an eye on the dinner. And would all get home.

181
00:27:42,65 --> 00:27:54,11
About half past eleven or so. And then come swarms of these people. Over for Sunday dinner. So when he die.

182
00:27:54,88 --> 00:27:55,83
He was a great loss.

183
00:27:55,97 --> 00:27:59,69
He held them together in their church and he held them together in that house

184
00:28:01,24 --> 00:28:03,77
and he knew that he fought for their right.

185
00:28:04,39 --> 00:28:11,02
You know he always used to tell them you have to get the same waiters a white man when you're working in the bananas.

186
00:28:11,83 --> 00:28:23,76
You can't take unless you work just as you have to get. So then I recalled. Very efficiently.

187
00:28:25,44 --> 00:28:33,92
I feel great occasion so many people are making great fuss of me because I always said I was his girl.

188
00:28:34,24 --> 00:28:38,06
Not my younger sister she looked like my mother but I looked like him.

189
00:28:39,32 --> 00:28:51,32
And said I said you know that Pete amassing scale. He'll never die is never dated while she lives. Remember that.

190
00:28:53,00 --> 00:28:58,8
As that just happened yesterday. And I can.

191
00:28:58,82 --> 00:29:07,5
And many of the open twenty miles to get to the funeral all the way from treated. To more when I'm back.

192
00:29:07,51 --> 00:29:21,11
And there was a more. At the hospital. It was painted pink. And the body light in the center. And you'd think it was.

193
00:29:21,13 --> 00:29:39,3
LENO No Stalin or. A King's death. Trial people who walked around the body came out and then the family went in.

194
00:29:41,07 --> 00:29:50,72
And I remember my oldest brother picking me up so we could I could kiss my fat.

195
00:29:50,73 --> 00:29:59,57
It was lovely those days you could do that. You could have a proper goodbye a proper farewell not like it is today.

196
00:29:59,58 --> 00:30:09,45
And well. In the polar bear court on my tall big brothers made sure that they were in.

197
00:30:09,91 --> 00:30:19,45
It was a great honor to be a poet. To Cough hours cough and. The funeral moved off.

198
00:30:21,2 --> 00:30:25,29
There was a great funeral service in the local Methodist church

199
00:30:26,79 --> 00:30:34,2
and then it just about a quarter of them are always the same entry and this mass of black suits.

200
00:30:35,94 --> 00:30:48,13
TATTERSALL blouses and skirts followed this post to symmetry. And he was very. And I'm told. Not so long ago.

201
00:30:48,23 --> 00:30:59,07
There was his peter mass in the thirteenth of July nineteen twenty four. Thats it.
