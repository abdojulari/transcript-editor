00:09:19,57 --> 00:09:25,75
beginning of the arch all the way
always. Yes. On the same side on

98
00:09:25,75 --> 00:09:26,90
a show. If you know

99
00:09:26,90 --> 00:09:32,99
a straight not side right and you come over
the south pole claridge's where did you

100
00:09:32,99 --> 00:09:38,25
come over the south side at all. No more
to show showed you all the north side and

101
00:09:38,25 --> 00:09:42,59
i wouldn't and i showed. Who was the foreman
over there on the on the north side.

102
00:09:44,01 --> 00:09:47,18
Thompson. Again sometimes and sometimes

103
00:09:47,18 --> 00:09:51,08
a good man could win for money. He knew

104
00:09:52,04 --> 00:09:55,63
a river or any harm. What
about the riggers with

105
00:09:55,63 --> 00:10:02,01
a good director of actually staging
how was it so good. Do you move goods

106
00:10:03,41 --> 00:10:08,00
couldn't be better. They
couldn't have weird thing

107
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:14,83

Khalifa and come to shove it

108
00:10:14,83 --> 00:10:21,74
again. Who was rescued. Yeah
but fred he was saying we are

109
00:10:21,74 --> 00:10:26,50
absolutely. Food for the
fall after he fell.

110
00:10:29,18 --> 00:10:32,88
There was nothing to hide. Was there anything
to hold on my was there and you know

111
00:10:32,89 --> 00:10:34,90
you just sit on the
stage you know i've got

112
00:10:34,90 --> 00:10:40,73
a real one on shane shane but there
was nothing for us to hold onto for

113
00:10:42,49 --> 00:10:48,74
. Words where we did
shove was used words you

114
00:10:50,42 --> 00:10:51,69
you couldn't buy

115
00:10:51,69 --> 00:10:57,51
a forfeit unless you were
struggling and fell off.

116
00:10:59,41 --> 00:11:00,31
And it was the job

117
00:11:00,31 --> 00:11:07,11
a different judge you've done
before. Now i don't know. You

118
00:11:07,12 --> 00:11:08,17
seem to like

119
00:11:08,17 --> 00:11:14,91
a very well and certainly ignorant
and i could time for them

120
00:11:15,83 --> 00:11:15,88
because

121
00:11:15,88 --> 00:11:22,39
a very good company were fine with that
before the printer after before adverts

122
00:11:24,77 --> 00:11:30,30
and all the steel was it that you working
on on the arch was that all from england

123
00:11:30,30 --> 00:11:37,12
dollar gold wrong wrong with no. Look for

124
00:11:37,12 --> 00:11:41,97
dome long treatment you want very should
be in the railways you will in the

125
00:11:41,97 --> 00:11:48,63
stations. You made friends realise you
wouldn't find any strong student no show.

126
00:11:48,68 --> 00:11:54,20
Honey i would shoot around the city. Oh
no i understand that. Yes but i mean you

127
00:11:54,20 --> 00:11:57,51
walk into the railway station with you
there and you look at that and you'll see

128
00:11:57,51 --> 00:11:58,03
dawn and

129
00:11:58,03 --> 00:12:04,68
a lot. I care for it because when you
tour before you sure don't. Yeah yeah.

130
00:12:06,45 --> 00:12:10,12
So you said you went right through from
the from the arch to the start to the

131
00:12:10,12 --> 00:12:17,06
finish work through it and dave

come. And it was your holder or take

133
00:12:23,69 --> 00:12:30,42
a crew member. A general way you
found him because you're into force.

134
00:12:32,25 --> 00:12:36,73
Now haven't seen him since you
had him all the way through was

135
00:12:36,73 --> 00:12:42,39
a hold up did him very well all the way
through and do i do you your moron know

136
00:12:42,39 --> 00:12:48,46
a bit of alright. And the riveting

137
00:12:49,68 --> 00:12:53,59
the tightness of the rivets with the duty
to the inspectors come round and and back

138
00:12:53,59 --> 00:12:59,91

happened if they were if they were not not

139
00:12:59,91 --> 00:13:04,59
tied to the first like it might come to
come march and how did you cut them out

140
00:13:05,48 --> 00:13:10,19
credit right shin. Up so i've got

141
00:13:12,77 --> 00:13:15,39

142
00:13:15,39 --> 00:13:22,15
a cup and function of
punch them through and

143
00:13:22,15 --> 00:13:27,61
what sort of percentage do you reckon that
you had to come up you know how many did

144
00:13:27,61 --> 00:13:29,48
you lost to come out or just

145
00:13:29,48 --> 00:13:34,29
a few my aunt myra i was good.
You know and i always always had

146
00:13:34,29 --> 00:13:40,89
a good test. In fact. Jimmy she was it was

147
00:13:41,70 --> 00:13:48,55
inspected. And i was taken
from one chord back.

148
00:13:50,45 --> 00:13:57,19
A nervous well-marked coach. And
i said to communication you

149
00:13:57,19 --> 00:13:57,50
took

150
00:13:57,50 --> 00:14:04,31
a more difficult drop. She was straight

151
00:14:05,79 --> 00:14:11,66
on the knee and he had no want to
go on ojha will take this one.

152
00:14:12,70 --> 00:14:16,68
Nash one and that one. When you take

153
00:14:16,68 --> 00:14:23,40
a much reflection. Sure. Watching

154
00:14:23,40 --> 00:14:29,65
a fairer. John not just say it's
good you have an easy of the

155
00:14:30,55 --> 00:14:35,34
year. Did you always have to read it down

156
00:14:35,34 --> 00:14:35,57
an

157
00:14:35,57 --> 00:14:42,49
e sometimes under the shame on knees
as very hard on top. Fret and top just

158
00:14:42,50 --> 00:14:45,52
feet on the bottom and it was

159
00:14:45,52 --> 00:14:50,96
a very hard work really think
it would be if you were under

00:14:50,96 --> 00:14:57,95
a river if you were pretty
right. You got you know it's

161

00:15:04,92 --> 00:15:05,44
for

163
00:15:05,44 --> 00:15:10,36
a long time. You know how many other of us
would you put in and the day we want one

164
00:15:10,36 --> 00:15:17,33
. Do you think there was
very easy. We just went

165
00:15:17,34 --> 00:15:23,60
naturally along. Didn't do anything. And i

166
00:15:24,65 --> 00:15:31,47
didn't have only i learned i
drew. And when you were you.

167
00:15:31,48 --> 00:15:36,04
Can you wonder how well clary have well
all the time. Yes you do see much of

168
00:15:36,04 --> 00:15:40,60
laurence ennis the director told whom
laurence ennis did you see much of him at all

169
00:15:40,60 --> 00:15:46,96
. Laurie lawrence ennis the director. If
you see anything of him you know i didn't

170
00:15:46,96 --> 00:15:49,87
see much of him. What about dr.

171
00:15:49,87 --> 00:15:51,88
Redfield if you see
anything of him to induct

172
00:15:51,88 --> 00:15:57,46
a brush you know jim what was he doing
just red checking i think you know he is

173
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,78
it very very because he won

174
00:16:02,79 --> 00:16:09,39
a bridge to be built. Yes yes and it was

175
00:16:09,39 --> 00:16:14,39
a shameless bridge over
time a contract to build

176
00:16:15,48 --> 00:16:20,22
a no bridge before the crash some ten had

177
00:16:20,22 --> 00:16:27,12
a bridge exactly the same design
shorter mission our village

178
00:16:28,99 --> 00:16:33,23
very much different than the design and i
said the design was very much different

179
00:16:33,23 --> 00:16:35,32
in which it was a shame of

180
00:16:35,32 --> 00:16:42,00
a shooting over the cambridge. You
know network for door for dong long

181
00:16:42,94 --> 00:16:43,28
to find

182
00:16:43,28 --> 00:16:51,73
a very judge you know his own. Not to do
you know we just owned it rain. There

183
00:16:51,73 --> 00:16:58,73
it will cambridge just to shame if
you go to scrap an i've been over

184
00:16:58,73 --> 00:17:02,28
there and i've seen the time but for the
time bridge has the top and bottom caught

185
00:17:02,28 --> 00:17:04,37
me at the bearings. Whereas

186
00:17:04,37 --> 00:17:10,87
a 300 ft difference here to the bridge here
has got you know in post about 300 feet

187
00:17:10,87 --> 00:17:16,87
long. I would have bridge where one over
and on the time it's got at the end of the

188
00:17:17,71 --> 00:17:22,49
post the top court in the bottom court
meet at the parent they come together at

189
00:17:22,49 --> 00:17:26,71
a point to bury you. And the new
castle bridge. Oh i shot from

190
00:17:26,71 --> 00:17:31,43
a tree and if you look something similar
that way but it's actually when you when

191
00:17:31,43 --> 00:17:32,84
you work it out. It's a i saw

192
00:17:32,84 --> 00:17:39,70
a human gene. As an arch bridge but the
top caught on the bottom caught me at the

193
00:17:39,70 --> 00:17:45,65
bearings either side and the new muscle
bridge. Oh i thought russian regime in fact

194
00:17:45,65 --> 00:17:49,71
. I thought of russia on the train. Well
in actual fact that he was consulting

195
00:17:49,71 --> 00:17:56,65
engineer on both yes that's true.
When you were you were here

196
00:17:56,65 --> 00:18:01,49
you never worked in the workshops at all.
Did you ever go to work never manage to

197
00:18:01,49 --> 00:18:01,69
give

198
00:18:01,69 --> 00:18:06,39
a go in the workshops. I want soon. But
where did you live when you worked on the

199
00:18:06,39 --> 00:18:12,75
bridge that question. You
know i can't i'm sure.

200
00:18:16,15 --> 00:18:22,67
There was with don the north side. No i

201
00:18:22,67 --> 00:18:28,68
didn't live don't now talk of love
or if more never loved you more.

202
00:18:31,43 --> 00:18:35,30
You can't remember where you lived in our
country and one. How did you get to get

203
00:18:35,30 --> 00:18:41,46
to work then. Oh yes i remember
when forever on the tram

204
00:18:42,64 --> 00:18:46,76
right down to circular quay.
Yes that's right. It's

205
00:18:46,77 --> 00:18:53,69
a fair distance not unless it's not that
far in the tram go. And we do get married

206
00:18:53,69 --> 00:19:00,47
during the time you were on the bridge at
my age i don't. Lovely wife she died. So

207
00:19:01,70 --> 00:19:08,46
and you live with your daughter that ice
age or they're all right when you when you

208
00:19:08,46 --> 00:19:09,63

a good one and we remember the
boilermakers union. Yes i'm still in

212
00:19:25,53 --> 00:19:32,02

00:19:40,48 --> 00:19:43,53
was in the union. You know do
you know charlie veron until

215
00:19:43,53 --> 00:19:50,07
a matter of fairness. Jamie on the bridge.
Can you remember any of the other

216
00:19:50,07 --> 00:19:52,67
boilermakers you worked
worked with on the reg

217
00:19:56,70 --> 00:20:02,95
a long time ago. You know i wouldn't have
money i mean if they knew. Charlie hayes

218
00:20:04,20 --> 00:20:04,45
and i do

219
00:20:04,45 --> 00:20:12,30
a shot of her i knew more no bridge
you know i showed you know we

220
00:20:12,30 --> 00:20:15,64
did you know you kelly. Did you. But kelly

221
00:20:15,64 --> 00:20:22,51
a fellow actor grew flesh.
When he fell irish or

222
00:20:22,51 --> 00:20:28,71
very next day. Well at least they
read it until the rigors and

223
00:20:30,24 --> 00:20:37,24
improved where kelly was because
you couldn't fall off when

224
00:20:37,25 --> 00:20:43,74
i got down there was
the bridges there were

225
00:20:43,75 --> 00:20:50,41
ordinary where they had weird
or even. We couldn't for

226
00:20:52,26 --> 00:20:55,86
you have any other accidents did you get
involved in any accidents or near misses

227
00:20:55,86 --> 00:21:02,43
and would involve them ahead of them
did you hear of. Different ones fail.

228
00:21:04,11 --> 00:21:10,72
You wouldn't know one thing more
only sean fell for you didn't know

229
00:21:10,72 --> 00:21:17,57
campbell or you know you know campbell
or addison. I don't know what

230
00:21:17,57 --> 00:21:19,32
actually he was a he was

231
00:21:19,32 --> 00:21:25,08
a he was he was about to make as assistant
working with stan london on he was

232
00:21:25,08 --> 00:21:30,03
belting up. Yes i knew
when he found he was on

233
00:21:30,03 --> 00:21:36,49
a course i me falling
on spent so long. Fun

234
00:21:39,62 --> 00:21:41,42
and you know it's like

235
00:21:41,42 --> 00:21:46,09
a fund you know stand up like you got

236
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,10
a wife to be

237
00:21:50,96 --> 00:21:55,84
a great around today and

238
00:21:55,85 --> 00:22:02,28
a full shot across of course. Yes it was

239
00:22:02,28 --> 00:22:05,77
a nasty business that there was there was

240
00:22:05,77 --> 00:22:10,14
a few was one and woods as well who was
over on the approach spans before that i

241
00:22:10,14 --> 00:22:14,45
don't cite one name woods. I had

242
00:22:14,46 --> 00:22:18,28
a bad word for norm and i was

243
00:22:18,28 --> 00:22:25,03
a rigger on that side to us and where
you are working. We were on the

244
00:22:25,03 --> 00:22:25,87
top court about

245
00:22:25,87 --> 00:22:31,57
a court i don't know tom ford. I think sorry
all the time i run the bottom cord. I

246
00:22:31,57 --> 00:22:38,40
started it and leaves it up.
And when the arch joined we

247
00:22:38,41 --> 00:22:42,42
were up there. I told them a cup cord.
We got there that night or waited

248
00:22:42,42 --> 00:22:48,44
a day. So you know day
to day. Yes i remember

249
00:22:50,42 --> 00:22:53,33
that day work then. There's

250
00:22:53,33 --> 00:22:56,78
a first time that you wear the cross. I
mean when was the first time you went

251
00:22:56,78 --> 00:22:57,98
across. Oh we want

252
00:22:57,98 --> 00:23:04,69
a cute even when i see the
plank over change of course we

253
00:23:04,70 --> 00:23:11,31
run across no again it is immature and
high on and i showed up. I shall say once

254
00:23:11,31 --> 00:23:18,21
you joined up. Yeah. Do you
remember who went across

255
00:23:18,21 --> 00:23:24,45
first. Oh yeah for bradfield

256
00:23:26,57 --> 00:23:29,79
you know i've heard all sorts of stories
you know i had one story whereby there was

257
00:23:29,79 --> 00:23:33,62
a wreck and the apprentices from the workshop
climbed the cranes and went over the

258
00:23:33,62 --> 00:23:38,92
top there that way. That's one thing you
couldn't do. That's why i think they

259
00:23:38,92 --> 00:23:40,65
couldn't do you say you know couldn't do

260
00:23:40,65 --> 00:23:47,47
a lot of close to that credit
ever probably stop putting you

261
00:23:47,47 --> 00:23:53,30
know he door shut and they reckon if they
claim that you on one from one train to

262
00:23:53,30 --> 00:23:59,43
the other one in the lunch.
That's not their regular

263
00:24:00,97 --> 00:24:06,64
here and there and they were princes in
the workshop. I reckon they clung to the

264
00:24:06,64 --> 00:24:11,43
lunch. Below and then they got onto the
grandfather and he put them alongside so

265
00:24:11,44 --> 00:24:18,24
they could do it but it only i
think you think it's allowed.

266
00:24:20,10 --> 00:24:26,81
And after they joined was it was it was
easier walking around after that. No i

267
00:24:26,81 --> 00:24:33,61
wasn't much yeah you know on the
absent joint we all work and

268
00:24:33,62 --> 00:24:39,24
yeah and you didn't try to
go course. Mary quote him

269
00:24:39,24 --> 00:24:45,99
a chair i walk and want to go yet.
Do you remember when before it

270
00:24:45,99 --> 00:24:52,44
joined whether the the courts used to
shake as the as the crane was moving

271
00:24:52,44 --> 00:24:55,97
a told you feel that now i
know there was never an

272
00:24:55,97 --> 00:25:02,04
a movement and now. In fact that the trend

273
00:25:03,75 --> 00:25:10,64
there i'm sure it was before
much. From the east or west on

274
00:25:10,65 --> 00:25:17,09
i know i showed one because it gives

275
00:25:17,09 --> 00:25:23,93
a song much. Kiloton watcher of the world.
You didn't feel it moving at all without

276
00:25:23,93 --> 00:25:29,84
when the crane was working and lifting
things you know never move and when you when

277
00:25:29,84 --> 00:25:33,52
they got close together and you can see
that they did see that they move you member

278
00:25:33,52 --> 00:25:39,68
that whenever they have several people said
that when they got close together. The

279
00:25:39,68 --> 00:25:44,06
two halves got close together that they
could see that they were swaying past each

280
00:25:44,06 --> 00:25:49,75
other. Straight and swaying in relation
to each other. The two you know for

281
00:25:49,75 --> 00:25:56,62
a you know there's no where
the cueball held. I had

282
00:25:56,62 --> 00:26:00,51
qq from voice showed she
was killed every where

283
00:26:03,58 --> 00:26:09,92
generals were actually in the ground. Yes
i understand and they held average. Yes.

284
00:26:09,97 --> 00:26:14,84
Their nose gear always had the ability

285
00:26:17,01 --> 00:26:22,94
. No want to. It will
just shrink east or west

286
00:26:24,18 --> 00:26:30,91
made. No on the hills like
them. No cordon around

287
00:26:30,91 --> 00:26:37,34
them but several people said that without
the temperature of the sun on one side

288
00:26:38,20 --> 00:26:43,77
compared to the other used to make the
two halves sometimes move in relation to

289
00:26:43,77 --> 00:26:47,45
each other. You wouldn't feel it but you
could see that time. If you had no no

290
00:26:47,45 --> 00:26:53,02
affect on. On to your tour
because and showed the chord

291
00:26:55,33 --> 00:27:02,31
some longer. Yes and they
control it. Actually

292
00:27:03,18 --> 00:27:10,16
if they were true i think
you know it. Surely he

293
00:27:10,90 --> 00:27:16,21
. The. Did you see the inspectors
go inside the court and measure the

294
00:27:17,56 --> 00:27:23,62
stresses and side that there was some
terra boy and i'm one come up with

295
00:27:23,62 --> 00:27:28,39
a northern ireland. No reference
to the chord. And that's

296
00:27:28,39 --> 00:27:32,23
a little thing really.

297
00:27:36,05 --> 00:27:42,92
Did you. Did you ever remember any
inspectors at all. You were part of your own

298
00:27:42,92 --> 00:27:49,34
one or any of the other people. I remember

299
00:27:50,05 --> 00:27:56,23
hillary care she would. Yeah and
factor. He inspected i work

300
00:27:57,80 --> 00:28:04,77
traitor. If it referred to him and
you think that's what ties are on

301
00:28:04,77 --> 00:28:11,51
that job and any others over there
just seems no teeter on the bridge an

302
00:28:12,32 --> 00:28:19,26
ordinary job. Course on the
ship but to return to gestured

303
00:28:19,26 --> 00:28:21,94
more friday on

304
00:28:24,84 --> 00:28:27,97
a boat in the hot hour no good you shall.

305
00:28:32,06 --> 00:28:34,54
And when you were. When
you were up to go up

306
00:28:34,54 --> 00:28:40,82
a morning. Did you take your lunch with
your did you come down the last time. What

307
00:28:40,82 --> 00:28:44,30
about toilet arrangements up there were
there anything like that up there. In which

308
00:28:44,30 --> 00:28:49,18
was any ties arrangements up the top and
you and he toilet arrangements up the top

309
00:28:49,18 --> 00:28:55,84
. You know i think were all good growing
everyone wanted to go to turkey. Did you

310
00:28:57,28 --> 00:29:04,14
know i know it was it was there any changing
rooms down below where you could hang

311
00:29:04,14 --> 00:29:09,23
it in such low. Hang the cruel
michoud on which side on

312
00:29:09,24 --> 00:29:15,64
a north side was any washing
facilities. You know do i think well i

313
00:29:16,65 --> 00:29:22,74
always try and i got really sick to
actually fish. You know. I fish and work at

314
00:29:22,74 --> 00:29:29,64
dirty. Did you ever scare you
up there with the wind. We are

315
00:29:29,64 --> 00:29:36,42
scared with the wind up there. Yes around
chump change was pretty nasty. When what

316
00:29:36,42 --> 00:29:43,04
it was to know you were we kept
law. You know i think yes. Where.

317
00:29:43,04 --> 00:29:49,84
What about when it was wet wet we had
to run the risk of slip and. I had

318
00:29:50,95 --> 00:29:55,11
understood. On my feet.
What were they made of.
