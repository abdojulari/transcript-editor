1
00:00:02,13 --> 00:00:04,3
Actually we're up to the question if we have got you.

2
00:00:04,79 --> 00:00:06,18
More years of the ruling

3
00:00:06,18 --> 00:00:12,72
or if you already meant always had to be going at all because the thought of your first meeting will force.

4
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:21,24
I think it was a I know it. First of the party. We have meaningful prayer in the. Woman.

5
00:00:21,55 --> 00:00:33,05
Much of one very elegant movements of a page three. Or for a man. And I really don't hear a actually.

6
00:00:33,94 --> 00:00:38,15
And here you are merely get referred to for.

7
00:00:39,12 --> 00:00:47,86
Not freely not overtly I think possibly was too large for purpose here is where I showed you before.

8
00:00:48,21 --> 00:00:56,23
So you know enough by a for was four years for proud of the From thing all day and.

9
00:00:57,62 --> 00:01:09,62
He was very demanding over the yes I have just a good day and. You were sent over to the side of ready.

10
00:01:10,29 --> 00:01:19,77
Yes and he did decide things for her that I think Theo is the leader best get him out on the she did her job

11
00:01:19,77 --> 00:01:29,34
but I think you will have basket basket. Made of us get him out if you are having He did a thing.

12
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:40,12
And a man called how Tom some Americans became our Also most vocal come out with no such thing as characteristic what

13
00:01:40,12 --> 00:01:58,39
you do. And everything you say. The first of the year. If you need it. And wages me in my eyes days you have asterisks.

14
00:01:59,94 --> 00:02:08,63
And. How very very much about. And he said that like you to do my after it. There are twelve of them.

15
00:02:09,49 --> 00:02:17,42
And we put the very long in those so I was there for a long Gross is a very I was ready. And they were great.

16
00:02:19,44 --> 00:02:28,26
But it was something simply because you read that they really should read it and they would just encourage From move

17
00:02:28,26 --> 00:02:34,41
but they only have her back to us and he does this thing and. How Thompson they know was American.

18
00:02:37,67 --> 00:02:43,48
He was quite right he was. Part she had gray and he had quite severe.

19
00:02:44,28 --> 00:02:48,17
And he was passing but out of the five of those you have a look back

20
00:02:48,17 --> 00:02:54,13
and I have a note from it was our way of old man but it was five scheme. In this way here.

21
00:02:54,57 --> 00:03:02,16
And this American voice of most. Use could come fish. I think we would go in the car and.

22
00:03:02,77 --> 00:03:03,46
He stayed up

23
00:03:03,64 --> 00:03:14,22
and he have whereby I have a go at a fair I think we should call it right we're going to close in on how home. And.

24
00:03:16,61 --> 00:03:26,91
Then I went into the army. And I had a lot because I was just local I Fers Argo were a little on what he thought.

25
00:03:27,86 --> 00:03:36,97
I was stationed to fish. I was sent first to the red light. When I was your about when I went away early.

26
00:03:37,42 --> 00:03:43,71
I was given you to give him a panic on the you thing. And you're off. So I'd like to go home.

27
00:03:44,8 --> 00:03:58,01
So you're off and we were not very long but she just said winds with the family way. From the very end on the way to.

28
00:04:00,01 --> 00:04:12,4
Single them. I'm losing my arms. That's when I did the camp come over feeling I was to show you all that work.

00:05:35,74 --> 00:05:46,46
Quickly with so much working very good year ago and I were in camp and I was able to throw in pair.

00:05:46,76 --> 00:05:55,5
With care at the back of our house. And be on ROOM. And happy all the time for the long haul.

38
00:05:56,01 --> 00:06:04,47
When I already and I would have the washer was for us. Well I'm having a very much.

41
00:06:26,86 --> 00:06:35,77
Havelock house buying the A single and then we were in who were who were called him before you meet the right.

42
00:06:37,19 --> 00:06:49,33
And I was Cheryl as a model but. It was my hook up with the clacking misleading them about a half equity book.

43
00:06:50,48 --> 00:07:00,02
I'm really lucky that I have a lot of the most Yeah OK. Never say that all.

44
00:07:01,73 --> 00:07:20,31
Russian forces there are folks saying oh we went well. Or something. Well good luck So karma.

45
00:07:23,67 --> 00:07:39,63
Very much talking about that was a ploy on I would be a study where I had a year in the house.

46
00:07:42,01 --> 00:08:00,09
That's where I met Jimmy are almost all. Oh you need to go away here to America. Held for five years.

47
00:08:00,97 --> 00:08:01,96
It would be more you know.

48
00:08:03,04 --> 00:08:10,17
If you were giving me I volunteered for this but one of my friends should go but I have to draw him out

49
00:08:10,64 --> 00:08:18,5
and I did not because I haven't had that house. I didn't my way over a guy you finish row source. Kind of.

50
00:08:19,63 --> 00:08:23,5
When you saw. Right. Wall.

51
00:08:26,29 --> 00:08:31,16
You know what it was really because I was in the infantry had to go

52
00:08:31,68 --> 00:08:39,41
but I never mousetraps you out if you have to so motivated even close with things like natural forces fighting.

53
00:08:40,97 --> 00:08:42,4
You know giving up being the four people.

54
00:08:44,2 --> 00:08:49,49
Out of corporate media playing the other game sharking when you go places you.

55
00:08:52,98 --> 00:09:06,35
Have terrible losses through for our for my to play not for I suppose hopes of thank you for your lies. So yeah. But.

56
00:09:07,54 --> 00:09:21,73
I think I can vouch for a very. Well yes that this was going to use it because it was rationing on me.

57
00:09:21,87 --> 00:09:32,92
And in my position not get anything right. About my remark California terrible things change.

58
00:09:32,93 --> 00:09:42,25
Do you have a cite for that stuff and focus on some of the all very. I've never seen it. And I'm bringing rush.

59
00:09:43,66 --> 00:09:53,79
Back anything by my hands off if it was OK. And I very much about him. Also saying how Holmes.

60
00:09:54,22 --> 00:09:59,6
And it was how come some of our very cool stuff was America.

61
00:10:01,99 --> 00:10:06,86
I think most of the head of the jail is not a day old

62
00:10:10,2 --> 00:10:23,23
and show off of half took a long while getting some of the most I was watching if I was first starting it was just

63
00:10:27,06 --> 00:10:28,48
while he went back to America.

64
00:10:29,38 --> 00:10:38,72
Yeah I was flying over to the coast foremost

65
00:10:38,72 --> 00:10:52,67
and I was in the air all the way to go you know what you have you got all you got that he was up

66
00:10:52,67 --> 00:11:14,42
and you know he was shot down by one of a hero in a shoot because you know you also hear what I didn't get a while that

67
00:11:14,71 --> 00:11:27,33
he was here when we knew. Although I came up. If I got some legs out get help and then I work a go it well.

68
00:11:27,35 --> 00:11:46,91
There are the most where you go but I was worried about him early help him out and I was local heroes

69
00:11:46,91 --> 00:12:05,38
and both play right. So I'm just. Good thing being in the side sort of business.

70
00:12:06,41 --> 00:12:21,29
Here is a very one hour year where little rifles are another very limited way in love and we saw a play about.

71
00:12:23,11 --> 00:12:26,98
I thank God for them because of something I want

72
00:12:28,27 --> 00:12:40,93
and you can really get my business sense for really really care about this sort of matter.

73
00:12:41,89 --> 00:12:42,99
He didn't care about money

74
00:12:43,58 --> 00:12:53,19
and he vowed that never coming home a lot more familiar with how go more smoothly with fear

75
00:12:53,36 --> 00:13:02,42
and fear you think I may very well because of their own almost family behind me though about Harry are some go away

76
00:13:02,42 --> 00:13:11,79
because there's nothing for the boy in Yiddish to replace say I'm my mother you can have a car.

77
00:13:14,56 --> 00:13:25,75
That didn't worry you never worry if you little room or how any more so for every serve you.

78
00:13:28,12 --> 00:13:47,74
If you are sick she said if you can then we shall of course if you are going to mark out can't work

79
00:13:50,72 --> 00:14:00,76
and he said let me know if a friend of emotion and I hate come back over.

80
00:14:00,99 --> 00:14:11,1
Although the hate before the war he had a gruesome crash. They will learn to live with this for what he had briefly.

81
00:14:12,24 --> 00:14:22,08
And when he came back there were no group. So I say it for all right you coming with me.

82
00:14:26,5 --> 00:14:37,06
Although I love my house and you have a house to move. And I pay for Simon Amstell. The farmer.

83
00:14:38,53 --> 00:14:51,23
I didn't bargain anything useful with it was you know it. And then we Chinese there to more stupid.

84
00:14:52,61 --> 00:15:04,1
You know with you about months of frozen and. We were in the work place this and that was so quick it was so.

85
00:15:06,05 --> 00:15:17,96
You go for it but when we went to vote for you what we're learning what we were we were lucky house in a way.

86
00:15:19,01 --> 00:15:29,99
And we knew right away and we do which if you're saying we think we have it and then we get it

87
00:15:30,83 --> 00:15:34,91
and we go in there with it. Right. And if you feel very good.

88
00:15:34,96 --> 00:15:42,94
Oh yeah we did all that for the right away then we'll go back and lock them out lovely house. I think.

89
00:15:44,21 --> 00:15:45,4
And we stitch up again.

90
00:15:47,24 --> 00:15:51,63
I know maybe things will go up again

91
00:15:52,79 --> 00:16:00,68
when I had my A short time after four years because I say work had nothing that is for the bench.

92
00:16:01,92 --> 00:16:12,27
Thank you set me back from him by referring to that we were joined from Michael Kay very mellow and I thank you for.

93
00:16:12,96 --> 00:16:27,17
Price. Oh you for the visuals so reduced price paid money. And. There's little way down the way.

94
00:16:28,69 --> 00:16:41,65
When you're more from the movie fish. And you say I'm seventy three. You're going to look ridiculous really.

95
00:16:42,71 --> 00:16:48,65
If you believe what I did because there's nothing else wrong. This is me.

96
00:16:48,84 --> 00:16:57,01
I said you were oh so funny is I think part of low you know you get war style.

97
00:16:57,4 --> 00:17:06,82
Oh yeah a little certain way and I know you. I mean I saw what might happen.

98
00:17:07,64 --> 00:17:12,2
But you say I can I Didn't you see I work for how Thompson.

99
00:17:12,87 --> 00:17:19,62
It was a little while ago of those who believe they are my movie Those would be good for all the goodies.

100
00:17:20,31 --> 00:17:36,33
This will help with yardwork a first. I knew he had nobody else. So and I knew it was about faith and I thought well.

101
00:17:38,63 --> 00:17:47,93
If you get a start a lot of forcing going on. I think admiration for essential.

102
00:17:50,96 --> 00:18:03,38
Isn't Enough so you might eventually say. He said he's nice. You know. So. Well not because she's right.

103
00:18:05,31 --> 00:18:14,32
Most of the fight in the face moment because he's yours had some go all right. Meet him. It didn't really matter.

104
00:18:14,58 --> 00:18:18,38
I went on I know even in the beginning.

105
00:18:18,62 --> 00:18:24,00
You're in the room the thought you know where you were all of you have a quote about staying.

106
00:18:24,09 --> 00:18:37,19
But when all you folks want to be a vessel and I so often with this kind of way

107
00:18:37,19 --> 00:18:47,34
but you can't you people never have never have I'm going to move it where I know where it all is another sort of

108
00:18:47,34 --> 00:18:57,75
personality. One of say passive main part of why I'm so well because I'm not.

109
00:18:57,92 --> 00:19:17,8
Maybe there's something out on the table and you do knock you know for forty you measure get a sixty five.

110
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:36,37
Roger course. With you know all the more we don't know if you have many things or by the way of psychosis.

111
00:19:36,45 --> 00:19:47,97
But you know if anything half of one of those. With the station because you rely on each other to do it. Where are you.

112
00:19:47,99 --> 00:20:00,64
What are you doing all that sort of thing you say. And it's a pleasure motion machine a goodish if you are very sure.

113
00:20:00,78 --> 00:20:04,11
I bet each of you go off.

114
00:20:05,28 --> 00:20:19,08
I mean I go to the Roman bowels Prado I'm sure they hate they ever think they may be enjoying it back home.

115
00:20:19,11 --> 00:20:37,25
You see especially when that was my wife sort of you know when they see it more from a really cool for a moment

116
00:20:37,25 --> 00:20:46,45
when they were all there with you know back on the hook for a little bit worse by the side of yes yes.

117
00:20:46,59 --> 00:20:56,34
Oh yeah I think a lot of us when I when I was he really made my day long about friendship not the crush

118
00:20:56,34 --> 00:21:11,21
and then much of it was a little like now you know all the so you know it was a little bit like now I think that the

119
00:21:11,21 --> 00:21:41,17
show even though you go and he's OK you know he's probably twenty four hopefully you will think you were fulfilling.

120
00:21:41,33 --> 00:21:52,25
So I think you said every way you agree and I think there is.

121
00:21:52,85 --> 00:22:04,35
I have a desk and that gives you a little bit of your safety. And when we sold the business and going straight.

122
00:22:06,17 --> 00:22:12,45
To some Amish people with love. For me we had a part of it.

123
00:22:12,72 --> 00:22:17,1
I was just like but I had my share of a lot of having for nothing.

124
00:22:17,92 --> 00:22:26,97
And since we were from and as I said I mean go home and then we sew through an English house.

125
00:22:29,2 --> 00:22:35,25
And I think we just got on a very good. If you find it in you. I didn't hear you.

126
00:22:35,37 --> 00:22:46,18
We'll a slow go with your book or you know and we took some or you have a way

127
00:22:46,18 --> 00:22:54,22
and we have a friend here have some rooms. It's great. Just down from our place.

128
00:22:55,05 --> 00:23:07,71
And they aware in a way John was saying one of those I was playing about in the orange tree the rock on top of him.

129
00:23:07,89 --> 00:23:15,15
Oh so you know exactly what world of pedophiles Shar you know and she had the rapes and she

130
00:23:15,15 --> 00:23:20,57
when you knew something about everything and she was a little bit of a nice guy live for ever. The family.

131
00:23:21,94 --> 00:23:29,25
And she was right. So we come right over if you see you. You bought it.

132
00:23:29,39 --> 00:23:32,57
You are you pushing away our future here passenger progress

133
00:23:32,57 --> 00:23:35,83
and more about what you want if you're going to sort of what was right.

134
00:23:35,97 --> 00:23:45,39
And we had I know a few mountains to finish up our way. And then we went three fourths of way.

135
00:23:49,58 --> 00:24:05,6
Or maybe forty eight not having a political battle over in fifty years here. He won't forgive me right.

136
00:24:06,37 --> 00:24:13,84
If you wish he would but if she were where you were going and they went on a great ship.

137
00:24:16,03 --> 00:24:25,46
He was very little very few who say this Bucky who and what I am by what they are like offset all that much house.

138
00:24:25,81 --> 00:24:37,17
And then I saw the problem when I was very sick from Mexico shingles all. OK And I remember this fucking. Rifle.

139
00:24:39,75 --> 00:24:48,57
From other. Shoot. Should I have to get out our stock market. And there's a big crowd get out.

140
00:24:48,58 --> 00:24:52,66
We're going to have to go with off the car said this is not the army.

141
00:24:53,12 --> 00:25:00,32
I'm paying to go on this back a vessel went past South Africa on that. OK Well that was.

142
00:25:00,94 --> 00:25:10,38
Anyhow arriving who will give you advice I should have tried to have thought OK well. I eighty years.

143
00:25:11,65 --> 00:25:20,93
Because of the everything I visit business I would all have a lot of radio on this. Are my mate from a few years.

144
00:25:22,13 --> 00:25:37,38
And I said to me after I had already seen your family be this back and have a for me. I have sorry courage.

145
00:25:37,7 --> 00:25:44,68
I can't tell you what I think I owe you but you have to pay for everything.

146
00:25:44,93 --> 00:25:56,88
So our actions must get rid of way and I couldn't bear the local going up this character.
