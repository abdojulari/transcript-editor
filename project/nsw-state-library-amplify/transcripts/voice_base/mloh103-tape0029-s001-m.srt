1
00:00:14,62 --> 00:00:20,76
So by to you know just.

2
00:00:21,91 --> 00:00:28,39
Asking. I ask you why. Do you happen to.

3
00:00:28,41 --> 00:00:34,39
A r p a n a.

4
00:00:34,41 --> 00:00:35,96
Nine and graham asking.

5
00:00:38,01 --> 00:00:41,86
I came to newcastle.

6
00:00:41,88 --> 00:00:45,35
Where i was a marine engineer.

7
00:00:45,37 --> 00:00:49,14
And the reason i ended
up in the north coast.

8
00:00:49,86 --> 00:00:56,53
Was i got busted for smoking
dope and sacked from the pay.

9
00:00:56,55 --> 00:00:58,48
And i spent a little
bit of time in sydney.

10
00:00:58,50 --> 00:01:02,91
After that which i hated when a friend
of mine dropped around one night

11
00:01:02,91 --> 00:01:07,57
and said he just bought a health
food restaurant in bangalore

12
00:01:09,87 --> 00:01:14,22
and dangle out then it down the back of
my mind for years because we travelled up

13
00:01:14,22 --> 00:01:17,94
here on holidays the child and i
remember bangalow just doing it.

14
00:01:19,00 --> 00:01:23,86
I think a little too. Which is still
used. And i wasn't doing anything else.

15
00:01:25,21 --> 00:01:28,90
And so i came up and worked in
his restaurant at the time.

16
00:01:29,74 --> 00:01:31,70
Was probably the only drama north coast.

17
00:01:31,85 --> 00:01:34,54
There's one in byron bay

18
00:01:36,53 --> 00:01:39,43
and i worked there for about three months.

19
00:01:40,20 --> 00:01:44,56
And that was because my friend was away
doing a different job filling in for him

20
00:01:46,53 --> 00:01:51,32
and i just heard of a farmhouse to rent a
place go berrying about to close to my

21
00:01:51,32 --> 00:01:57,54
well under $4 a week.

22
00:01:57,56 --> 00:02:04,32
And so i went live there and i
found. One fall in the paradise.

23
00:02:04,34 --> 00:02:09,88
There was one other household of people
from sydney which was at that instance

24
00:02:09,88 --> 00:02:12,76
that i referred to before and

25
00:02:14,85 --> 00:02:21,50
and wonderfully well welcoming
rural people who offered jobs.

26
00:02:22,34 --> 00:02:29,59
Gave us free food etc..

27
00:02:30,36 --> 00:02:31,13
And at the time

28
00:02:31,13 --> 00:02:33,86
that was the time of the whole earth
catalog everyone had a whole earth catalog

29
00:02:34,83 --> 00:02:41,34
and we also we were getting away
from big city life more simple life

30
00:02:41,34 --> 00:02:43,28
rural existence.

31
00:02:43,30 --> 00:02:44,32
Which was totally true

32
00:02:46,27 --> 00:02:52,10
and existed in this marvelously
bucolic existence.

33
00:02:52,12 --> 00:02:54,88
Until the dreaded aquarius first.

34
00:02:56,48 --> 00:02:59,18
And i think at that time was.

35
00:02:59,20 --> 00:03:00,75
We shouldn't tell anyone else

36
00:03:00,75 --> 00:03:07,70
and keep it very quiet. Because.

37
00:03:09,02 --> 00:03:12,49
I could see that. The easy life.

38
00:03:13,19 --> 00:03:16,38
We were having would be sort of moral
is taken away became more popular.

39
00:03:19,16 --> 00:03:21,22
And that's turned out something like that.

40
00:03:21,28 --> 00:03:28,17
I guess but it's been good.

41
00:03:29,16 --> 00:03:33,67
And how i fit in with the aquarian people.

42
00:03:34,56 --> 00:03:40,58
And their sort of people i like to mix
with but i don't think like you know.

43
00:03:42,37 --> 00:03:45,00
And they're more straightforward and
scientific way of looking at things.

44
00:03:45,32 --> 00:03:50,46
I guess that's because my
engineering background. That.

45
00:03:50,48 --> 00:03:56,56
It's all been good fun.
At the time it was.

46
00:03:58,57 --> 00:04:04,95
Out. I'm judy arpanet. And i.

47
00:04:04,97 --> 00:04:11,50
Left melbourne in 1970 to early 1970 to

48
00:04:12,51 --> 00:04:16,28
with my partner of the time
and my daughter portia

49
00:04:17,17 --> 00:04:19,01
and we decided to go on the road.

50
00:04:20,83 --> 00:04:24,64
We sold everything and given
away all our possessions.

51
00:04:24,89 --> 00:04:27,91
We could quiet a tent a four wheel drive

52
00:04:28,60 --> 00:04:34,39
and we'd taken about nine months
to get up from victoria up to here

53
00:04:34,39 --> 00:04:40,03
and we camped along the way in the murray
river for several months and explored

54
00:04:40,03 --> 00:04:46,01
and we were on our way around australia.
We had friends up on the north coast.

55
00:04:46,32 --> 00:04:48,61
So we decided to call in and see them

56
00:04:49,99 --> 00:04:56,31
and one of them happened to be living
in barring bar where graeme was living.

57
00:04:56,33 --> 00:04:58,98
The day we drove into mullumbimby
was a wonderful day.

58
00:04:59,35 --> 00:05:01,78
We drove up into cooper's lane

59
00:05:01,78 --> 00:05:07,47
and the local alternate people were having
what we used to have in those days which

60
00:05:07,47 --> 00:05:09,01
was a barter we'd gather together

61
00:05:09,01 --> 00:05:15,77
and we'd swap whatever we had which ranged
from sort of bush nuts to wild cucumbers

62
00:05:15,77 --> 00:05:20,69
to food or bread that somebody had
baked or fruit and vegetables

63
00:05:20,69 --> 00:05:24,27
that people had picked clothes that
they'd bought back from india.

64
00:05:24,52 --> 00:05:30,03
So you could go shopping at the
barter with your parties and all

65
00:05:30,03 --> 00:05:35,44
and come home with clothes and fruit
and vegetables and various things and

66
00:05:35,45 --> 00:05:38,61
that was a very welcoming group of people

67
00:05:39,65 --> 00:05:41,62
and they showed us where
we could put up a tent.

68
00:05:41,77 --> 00:05:44,96
I asked somebody how difficult
it was to find a house

69
00:05:44,96 --> 00:05:48,24
and she said well it's
actually quite difficult.

70
00:05:48,64 --> 00:05:53,82
You usually have to wait a couple of
weeks which delighted me and i ended up.

71
00:05:54,02 --> 00:05:59,77
We ended up having a lovely farmhouse there
for several months. During that time.

72
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,26
People started talking about this
gathering that was going to happen in

73
00:06:04,26 --> 00:06:11,96
and none of us knew where neumann was
it was somewhere over the mountain so.

74
00:06:11,98 --> 00:06:15,57
One by one we drifted over to nimbin.

75
00:06:15,59 --> 00:06:18,25
Most of us knew somebody
who was already agony

76
00:06:18,25 --> 00:06:22,29
and then these people had
come back over to the coast

77
00:06:22,29 --> 00:06:23,84
and say oh well it's quite exciting.

78
00:06:24,20 --> 00:06:27,82
What's happening over in yemen and so
and so there and they're doing this and

79
00:06:27,82 --> 00:06:32,92
that so we decided sort of
collectively that we would go over

80
00:06:32,92 --> 00:06:39,13
and join this festival. So we
gathered together a tribe and.

81
00:06:39,15 --> 00:06:41,83
We were fairly anxious about this festival

82
00:06:41,83 --> 00:06:47,05
and we weren't sure how many people were
going to descend upon this place so we

83
00:06:47,05 --> 00:06:53,87
decided to rent our own little piece of
land attached to the main festival site.

84
00:06:54,17 --> 00:06:57,76
This became known as the magic circle.

85
00:06:57,78 --> 00:07:04,49
And so we also built our little
dwellings my tent was actually

86
00:07:04,49 --> 00:07:09,88
the most. Weatherproof and at one stage
it rained just before the festival

87
00:07:09,88 --> 00:07:14,55
and i had 30 people in my tent.

88
00:07:16,96 --> 00:07:18,04
So.

89
00:07:18,88 --> 00:07:19,91
That put us on alert

90
00:07:19,91 --> 00:07:26,48
and people made slightly more weatherproof
dwellings out of plastic and bits

91
00:07:26,49 --> 00:07:31,59
and pieces and bamboo and
grass and various things so

92
00:07:32,82 --> 00:07:35,57
and a few people had tea parties.

93
00:07:35,59 --> 00:07:38,66
As the original magic circle inhabit

94
00:07:38,66 --> 00:07:42,54
and settled in all our
friends started to arrive.

95
00:07:42,56 --> 00:07:48,64
We'd also set up our own food line
where we hired a truck and decided

96
00:07:48,64 --> 00:07:51,92
that if a million people
descended we could still get out

97
00:07:51,92 --> 00:07:57,60
and get up to the brisbane market to bring
back the fresh fruit and vegetables.

98
00:07:57,62 --> 00:07:59,85
This didn't really need.

99
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,15
Need to happen because in fact
it was very well organised

100
00:08:03,15 --> 00:08:08,08
and the amount of people that arrived
seemed to be the right amount.

101
00:08:08,10 --> 00:08:13,28
It was a very exciting time being there
for a few weeks before the festival.

102
00:08:14,94 --> 00:08:18,97
Just as a few more people drifted
in and the constant change

103
00:08:18,97 --> 00:08:24,21
that started to happen. We started off
as a couple of hundred people and.

104
00:08:24,82 --> 00:08:29,63
As the festival got closer you could.
The excitement and the unknown.

105
00:08:29,77 --> 00:08:31,33
What was going to happen.

106
00:08:31,34 --> 00:08:36,75
Were thousands of people going to
descend or the tens of thousands

107
00:08:36,75 --> 00:08:41,37
or merely hundreds and that unknown
element was very exciting.

108
00:08:43,04 --> 00:08:46,85
So we had all these contingency plan set.

109
00:08:46,87 --> 00:08:51,60
And as the festival just
grew it was quite organic.

110
00:08:51,62 --> 00:08:55,98
And very exciting to just walk around
the festival site and there was music

111
00:08:55,98 --> 00:09:01,27
and alternative healing and various
friends of friends turning up

112
00:09:01,27 --> 00:09:03,58
and discovering that you were connected

113
00:09:03,58 --> 00:09:08,89
and knew all these other people who
also knew all these other people so.

114
00:09:08,91 --> 00:09:12,03
One of the exciting parts was when the.

115
00:09:12,05 --> 00:09:16,30
Feeble foundry bus arrived
from melbourne with.

116
00:09:16,32 --> 00:09:19,88
Close to 40 or 50 people
on board with children

117
00:09:19,88 --> 00:09:24,57
and musical instruments
and beautiful songs

118
00:09:24,57 --> 00:09:26,88
and also their wonderful skill

119
00:09:26,88 --> 00:09:33,56
and knowledge of baking wholesome
bread and cakes and so forth.

120
00:09:33,79 --> 00:09:39,35
They took over the local bakery
and supplied the whole festival.

121
00:09:39,77 --> 00:09:43,18
With wonderful goodies.

122
00:09:45,90 --> 00:09:51,43
The high was. One memory i.

123
00:09:51,45 --> 00:09:58,08
Very clear to me during the first of all
was i was walking down the road from the

124
00:09:58,08 --> 00:09:59,74
magic circle toward the main.

125
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,60
Area and and there was doug anthony with
his wife margo and doug at the time was.

126
00:10:05,99 --> 00:10:07,77
Leader of the country party

127
00:10:08,60 --> 00:10:13,25
and he was dressed in
casual country party gear

128
00:10:13,25 --> 00:10:16,33
and it long socks and sure

129
00:10:17,50 --> 00:10:22,31
that he was looking quite relaxed in
didn't have any minders where there is no

130
00:10:22,32 --> 00:10:23,09
mobile phone.

131
00:10:23,72 --> 00:10:30,00
And it's just it's just another example
of how tolerant the local people are.

132
00:10:30,73 --> 00:10:35,24
Of daag. Drugs or art. Yes.

133
00:10:36,01 --> 00:10:40,63
Yes one of my memories was just
before the festival began.

134
00:10:40,93 --> 00:10:42,42
I was walking down the road

135
00:10:42,42 --> 00:10:48,58
and i met two old brothers they
were men in their seventies

136
00:10:48,58 --> 00:10:50,61
or eighties who'd been born in

137
00:10:51,82 --> 00:10:57,08
and they invited us in for a cup
of tea and bread and butter

138
00:10:58,36 --> 00:11:02,90
and so we wafted in and we probably had
very little clothes on. I can't remember.

139
00:11:03,22 --> 00:11:06,95
I think we put a sarong on when we
actually went out of the magic circle

140
00:11:08,16 --> 00:11:12,63
and i remember sitting on their veranda
looking down onto the festival site

141
00:11:12,63 --> 00:11:17,52
and talking to these men about their
feelings of what was happening in their

142
00:11:18,41 --> 00:11:22,85
isolated little country town
they were they were delighted

143
00:11:22,85 --> 00:11:26,17
and thrilled to them it was
like there were young people

144
00:11:26,17 --> 00:11:31,94
and their their home was being
discovered and nurtured

145
00:11:31,94 --> 00:11:35,53
and they were very positive about it but
i thought it was a really good thing

146
00:11:35,53 --> 00:11:38,89
that was happening. I assume
those men are no longer alive.

147
00:11:39,23 --> 00:11:43,63
20 years later but it was
really lovely to make

148
00:11:43,63 --> 00:11:47,04
that connection with people
who'd been born there and seen

149
00:11:47,04 --> 00:11:53,87
and go from quite a lucrative
farming community to a dying town

150
00:11:54,66 --> 00:11:59,69
after the money is gone out of dairy
industry and they were delighted that young.

151
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,80
People were discovering
their area and to them it.

152
00:12:02,81 --> 00:12:08,31
It represented life issues.

153
00:12:08,33 --> 00:12:14,91
That.

154
00:12:14,93 --> 00:12:17,16
We didn't start and him and
we weren't living in them

155
00:12:17,16 --> 00:12:23,64
and we were living in barring that
we went back to burying that.

156
00:12:24,40 --> 00:12:32,53
But after about three years of four years
of living on almost no money whatsoever.

157
00:12:32,54 --> 00:12:36,57
I decided i can get a job. And.

158
00:12:38,20 --> 00:12:39,76
I worked on.

159
00:12:41,86 --> 00:12:46,49
First of all the queensland state
government ship and torres strait

160
00:12:47,26 --> 00:12:53,88
and then later on on prawn trawlers
mcgovern carpentaria. And.

161
00:12:53,90 --> 00:12:58,07
And smallest ended my connection with the.

162
00:12:59,36 --> 00:13:04,86
Back to the earth movement. And
i never money out of that.

163
00:13:06,65 --> 00:13:13,14
And i continue my relationship with
judy and i are expecting a child and.

164
00:13:13,16 --> 00:13:18,94
We went totally against the trend again
and bought a house. In dreaded lid more.

165
00:13:18,96 --> 00:13:23,69
And all our friends living in
the hill thought we were crazy.

166
00:13:24,80 --> 00:13:30,25
But however since then friends
have also been forced to get jobs

167
00:13:30,25 --> 00:13:37,04
and i've also ended up by cows in lismore.

168
00:13:37,06 --> 00:13:40,96
And after the first of all
we went back to mullumbimby

169
00:13:41,86 --> 00:13:44,69
but i was still in my gipsy mode.

170
00:13:44,93 --> 00:13:51,92
So we packed our tent once again and headed
for north queensland where we spent.

171
00:13:51,93 --> 00:13:55,10
Six or eight months.

172
00:13:55,11 --> 00:13:59,34
That was in 74 flood.

173
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,23
And it was very wild up in
north queensland in a tent.

174
00:14:03,27 --> 00:14:07,69
So we came back down to barring bar
with a cyclone one day in front of it

175
00:14:07,69 --> 00:14:12,66
and a cyclone one day behind us being
stopped every hundred kilometres by floods

176
00:14:12,66 --> 00:14:15,40
across the road. It was
a very exciting time.

177
00:14:17,46 --> 00:14:23,17
Because you kept on meeting up with
the same people at the same flood.

178
00:14:23,95 --> 00:14:25,64
I came back to the bearing bar valley

179
00:14:25,64 --> 00:14:29,99
and a friend of mine had just moved out
of her farmhouse and gave it to me.

180
00:14:31,29 --> 00:14:35,94
We lived there for two years. My
daughter went to school there.

181
00:14:36,95 --> 00:14:43,88
I got a little bit of work picking
tomatoes for local farmers. And.

182
00:14:43,90 --> 00:14:45,02
I by

183
00:14:45,02 --> 00:14:51,08
that time had saved enough money through
the work to go to india i discovered

184
00:14:51,08 --> 00:14:57,36
thabet and buddhism by that time and. I
was invited to on the monastery in nepal.

185
00:14:57,73 --> 00:15:02,37
So i took my daughter who
was 12. By that time.

186
00:15:02,39 --> 00:15:08,14
To india and we lived in fear and
europe for two and a half years.

187
00:15:09,46 --> 00:15:16,55
A bit like graham going away broke my
connection with the back to the earth.

188
00:15:16,57 --> 00:15:22,60
Movement and while i saw it
as a still a lovely ideal

189
00:15:22,60 --> 00:15:28,74
and a lovely way to live circumstances
had changed and travel had changed me.

190
00:15:29,75 --> 00:15:34,56
So i came back and worked on the prawn
trawler with graham for a little while

191
00:15:34,56 --> 00:15:37,72
and.

192
00:15:37,74 --> 00:15:41,14
That's when we really got
together and had a child

193
00:15:41,14 --> 00:15:45,66
and lived in a little more for a year

194
00:15:45,67 --> 00:15:49,49
or so because.

195
00:15:50,43 --> 00:15:55,85
Here is. Well for me.

196
00:15:55,89 --> 00:15:58,49
Nimbin is very much.

197
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,70
A place that i couldn't live in i
have many friends who live out there.

198
00:16:05,72 --> 00:16:11,71
The aboriginal stories of
it being a ceremonial place

199
00:16:11,71 --> 00:16:14,61
and not a place especially
for women to live.

200
00:16:14,69 --> 00:16:15,79
It's very true

201
00:16:15,79 --> 00:16:21,52
and real for me i find it very difficult
just to even drive to nimbin much easier

202
00:16:21,52 --> 00:16:23,24
to drive over to the coast

203
00:16:24,56 --> 00:16:30,67
but i have i love being close to nimbin
from a sociological point of view it is a

204
00:16:30,67 --> 00:16:35,57
wonderful experiment and it has
really worked on many levels.

205
00:16:37,20 --> 00:16:41,66
The levels that it's worked on and not
seen by many people who visit the town.

206
00:16:42,72 --> 00:16:48,61
People tend to focus on the negative aspects
of this very small town with no back

207
00:16:48,61 --> 00:16:53,35
streets. So everything
happens on the main street.

208
00:16:53,36 --> 00:16:58,60
People are assumed that's all there
is to name and but in fact the way

209
00:16:58,60 --> 00:17:03,39
that various communities have grown
and handle their own problems

210
00:17:03,39 --> 00:17:09,57
and become self-sufficient and the way
that the children are looked after

211
00:17:09,57 --> 00:17:12,35
and cared for and the
feeling of community.

212
00:17:14,02 --> 00:17:20,60
I think is quite extraordinary and go fairly
unnoticed. Which may be a good thing.

213
00:17:20,62 --> 00:17:22,19
Maybe that's why it works

214
00:17:22,19 --> 00:17:28,97
that people are left alone out in the hills
to actually live out their dreams sort

215
00:17:28,97 --> 00:17:34,95
out their problems. They're not a
drain on the local economy at all.

216
00:17:35,07 --> 00:17:39,28
In fact they enhance it. And
i think in future years.

217
00:17:40,89 --> 00:17:46,51
The communities and him and will be
used as a model to many other places.

218
00:17:47,10 --> 00:17:49,44
It's been quite difficult

219
00:17:49,44 --> 00:17:55,26
and the level of commitment of
people to live out their ideals

220
00:17:55,26 --> 00:17:57,77
and their dreams is quite extraordinary.

221
00:18:01,31 --> 00:18:07,30
And i can't think of anywhere else in
australia where people have actually cheevers

222
00:18:07,30 --> 00:18:10,14
much as some of the communities
around women have achieved

223
00:18:14,12 --> 00:18:14,17
and

224
00:18:16,53 --> 00:18:23,04
that.

225
00:18:23,06 --> 00:18:27,93
The advent of newman and the total
change in the population there.

226
00:18:28,35 --> 00:18:34,20
Had had quite a profound
effect on local politics.

227
00:18:35,69 --> 00:18:41,08
Many many proposals are going to lose more
council which there is no other council

228
00:18:41,08 --> 00:18:46,21
would even think about doing and i
think it's mainly because the idea

229
00:18:46,21 --> 00:18:52,33
that are being generated
in them and they're still.

230
00:18:53,23 --> 00:18:55,60
A lot of conservative.

231
00:18:57,00 --> 00:19:01,26
Sort of digging their heels in against
it that it will only continue and.

232
00:19:02,58 --> 00:19:06,17
And i think.

233
00:19:06,19 --> 00:19:15,79
I see the benefit of legal
counsel all around.

234
00:19:15,81 --> 00:19:21,76
One of my notices memories of being in the
magic circle as one of the musicians in

235
00:19:21,76 --> 00:19:24,99
the magic circle was a
man called call joseph

236
00:19:24,99 --> 00:19:31,11
and we used to sort of a tradition developed
there where we'd wake everybody up in

237
00:19:31,11 --> 00:19:35,98
the morning by going to just outside their
little dwelling and singing to them

238
00:19:35,98 --> 00:19:38,50
and they would sort of
emerge out of their tents

239
00:19:38,50 --> 00:19:43,10
and in the end there'd be a whole lot of
troupe of people couple of hundred people

240
00:19:43,10 --> 00:19:46,15
all singing made a long
time sun shine upon you

241
00:19:46,15 --> 00:19:50,54
and another song about
butterflies of paul and britain

242
00:19:50,55 --> 00:19:55,66
and it was very idealistic
very pied piper ish

243
00:19:55,66 --> 00:19:59,80
and it was a very lovely
way to start the day and.

244
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,48
I sway to wake up. The
truth at all. Very much.

245
00:20:05,52 --> 00:20:11,65
The troubadour there was also a
wonderful french acrobat person high

246
00:20:12,44 --> 00:20:15,89
type rope high wire
person called filippo t.

247
00:20:16,27 --> 00:20:20,06
And he used to do shows
in the middle of nimbin

248
00:20:20,06 --> 00:20:23,57
and put up a rope between
a hotel and a park

249
00:20:23,57 --> 00:20:28,38
and walk on it with
umbrellas and on one leg

250
00:20:28,38 --> 00:20:34,11
and the children were just entranced
absolutely entranced as were the adults.

251
00:20:35,46 --> 00:20:41,75
But there was another troupe of people
from new zealand called blurter who were

252
00:20:41,75 --> 00:20:46,21
again like theatre wandering
minstrel people they had a big bar.

253
00:20:47,99 --> 00:20:52,02
And they used to put on shows
on the streets or in town

254
00:20:52,02 --> 00:20:53,40
or around the festival site.

255
00:20:53,64 --> 00:20:57,47
So there was a lot of the
troubadour feeling there

256
00:20:57,47 --> 00:21:02,21
and a lot of freedom for people to
express themselves and take risks

257
00:21:02,21 --> 00:21:08,91
and be creative and. There was very little
judgment. The children were really safe.

258
00:21:09,11 --> 00:21:11,80
My daughter was about nine at the time

259
00:21:11,80 --> 00:21:16,00
and i remember walking through
the festival with her one day

260
00:21:16,00 --> 00:21:18,29
and she knew hundreds of people

261
00:21:18,29 --> 00:21:21,88
and everywhere we went you'd
hear hi portia hi portia

262
00:21:22,71 --> 00:21:24,67
and she just knew everyone from being.

263
00:21:25,35 --> 00:21:30,60
In this very safe environment for
weeks and getting to know people

264
00:21:30,60 --> 00:21:36,04
and she'd be fed by the hari krishnas
and she knew far more people than i did

265
00:21:36,04 --> 00:21:36,54
and in fact

266
00:21:36,54 --> 00:21:41,47
that was true of a lot of the children at
the time it was a very safe environment

267
00:21:41,47 --> 00:21:46,76
and they could go off and do exciting
things and make movies and video

268
00:21:47,55 --> 00:21:51,05
and travel around with musicians and.

269
00:21:51,07 --> 00:21:53,59
There was a great feeling
of optimism for the future.

270
00:21:58,49 --> 00:21:59,75
Washes up here in lismore.

271
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:06,08
The moment and it's just
become a mother herself.

272
00:22:06,10 --> 00:22:11,26
As she was growing up into her
late teens and early twenties.

273
00:22:11,48 --> 00:22:16,75
There was some feeling of why
didn't i get have a normal life

274
00:22:18,24 --> 00:22:20,52
but as she got older. She's
been able to look back

275
00:22:20,52 --> 00:22:24,99
and really appreciate the value of
the upbringing that she did have

276
00:22:24,99 --> 00:22:27,20
and the freedom and the diversity

277
00:22:27,99 --> 00:22:31,30
and one of her abilities
is to be very tolerant

278
00:22:31,30 --> 00:22:35,82
and to be able to relate to many
many many different sorts of people.

279
00:22:36,20 --> 00:22:42,63
So in fact i think it's helped her to
fit into society as it is today very

280
00:22:42,63 --> 00:22:49,14
easily. I guess traveling overseas.
Help that process as well.

281
00:22:52,04 --> 00:22:54,83
So it was quite influential for her.

282
00:22:56,33 --> 00:23:01,36
It hasn't hindered her one of my
concerns as she got older idea i've been

283
00:23:01,36 --> 00:23:06,77
irresponsible and i haven't prepared
her for university and life.

284
00:23:07,45 --> 00:23:12,49
But in fact it's the opposite.
She's got a great ability to.

285
00:23:12,50 --> 00:23:17,47
To survive survive well has very
clear values about what she wants

286
00:23:17,47 --> 00:23:20,94
and what she doesn't want.

287
00:23:22,02 --> 00:23:22,41
Yeah

288
00:23:22,42 --> 00:23:30,29
that i guess it worked in a reverse way.

289
00:23:31,03 --> 00:23:36,06
And other memory i have the first of all
we're spending about how morning up in a

290
00:23:36,06 --> 00:23:40,45
tree. And tempting to put into practice.

291
00:23:40,83 --> 00:23:46,77
Another person's idea what sort of shelter
you could make with a large flat sheet

292
00:23:46,77 --> 00:23:53,58
of plastic. After several hours
and not being able to produce.

293
00:23:53,60 --> 00:23:59,93
A shelter something like the
expo sale. Eventually made.

294
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:02,33
That's her a simple ridge pole tent.

295
00:24:03,01 --> 00:24:07,71
Which she was rather take about at
the time but when the rain came down

296
00:24:07,71 --> 00:24:10,37
and it was an approved be a
perfectly adequate shelter.

297
00:24:10,72 --> 00:24:15,45
I think she was rather pleased.

298
00:24:15,46 --> 00:24:19,50
With the way that.

299
00:24:21,09 --> 00:24:22,87
Oh yeah and i also realize

300
00:24:22,87 --> 00:24:26,84
that you can only fold a flat sheet
of paper a long straight line

301
00:24:26,84 --> 00:24:31,89
that it can stretch and make the
marvelous shape that she had in my hand.

302
00:24:35,02 --> 00:24:35,29
Right.

303
00:24:37,17 --> 00:24:43,12
And practically have correct yeah.

304
00:24:43,14 --> 00:24:47,12
However that the tent that i was
staying in was a friend of mine.

305
00:24:47,40 --> 00:24:54,19
And it was a perfect had adequate
shelter. It was a. It was a parachute.

306
00:24:55,10 --> 00:25:01,04
With a clip of it with
plastic conduit framing.

307
00:25:01,06 --> 00:25:11,39
And you travel was the
parachute wasn't waterproofed.

308
00:25:11,40 --> 00:25:13,54
You know.

309
00:25:13,56 --> 00:25:14,17
It didn't work

310
00:25:14,17 --> 00:25:21,10
that well i think it might
have ended up in judy's tent.

311
00:25:25,32 --> 00:25:31,43
One of the characters i remember
in the magic circle was a public

312
00:25:32,45 --> 00:25:35,08
though he me in character
called adrian rawlins

313
00:25:35,78 --> 00:25:42,22
and adrian was part of the magic
circle and did various performances

314
00:25:42,22 --> 00:25:46,90
and danced around and told lots of stories

315
00:25:46,90 --> 00:25:49,98
and generally added a lot of color.

316
00:25:54,53 --> 00:25:59,76
Yeah i won't tell you off by.

317
00:26:00,84 --> 00:26:07,41
No. Call the.

318
00:26:07,43 --> 00:26:13,08
Us. For or so past.

319
00:26:14,00 --> 00:26:15,17
My name is paul burke

320
00:26:15,17 --> 00:26:19,35
and i used to ride my motorbike
for nice rides up the coast road

321
00:26:19,35 --> 00:26:23,82
and look at byron bay and marlin
the me and places like that

322
00:26:23,82 --> 00:26:25,38
and i'd heard of this retreat.

323
00:26:26,52 --> 00:26:29,88
That was set up on quite a few
hundred acres for gay men.

324
00:26:30,82 --> 00:26:32,04
It was called mandala

325
00:26:32,04 --> 00:26:37,52
and it was run by a man called david
johnson who was in the theater

326
00:26:37,52 --> 00:26:41,76
and. I guess vegie garden and.

327
00:26:41,78 --> 00:26:46,87
He had a concept that gay men
could actually come up here and.

328
00:26:47,83 --> 00:26:51,54
Do meditation retreat and do gardening

329
00:26:51,54 --> 00:26:57,21
and all sorts of alternative ways
of looking at their lives and.

330
00:26:57,23 --> 00:26:58,88
So i first came up

331
00:26:58,88 --> 00:27:04,65
and went to mandala i think it was the
spring 10 day spring retreat and.

332
00:27:05,48 --> 00:27:11,24
It was fantastic. We worship the
goddess of selma and selma.

333
00:27:11,50 --> 00:27:14,85
Would chant with selma and
chant the full moon up

334
00:27:14,85 --> 00:27:16,57
and it was it was a nice experience

335
00:27:17,49 --> 00:27:21,74
and a lot of the retreat the
david had with silent retreat.

336
00:27:21,76 --> 00:27:26,38
And so i guess the aim was to
get to a spiritual higher.

337
00:27:26,66 --> 00:27:30,85
Very similar to religious
retreat in a lot of ways

338
00:27:31,59 --> 00:27:37,67
but in doing so we got really close
to one another and. Instead of.

339
00:27:37,69 --> 00:27:42,84
The humbug rush of the city where you know
we really didn't get the one another.

340
00:27:42,85 --> 00:27:46,78
Personally this place was great
for gay men to go along to

341
00:27:46,78 --> 00:27:51,03
and to talk and discuss often.

342
00:27:51,32 --> 00:27:55,76
Ourselves and to get to play
with the earth. Or you.

343
00:27:56,27 --> 00:27:59,88
Miss would have been
in the early eighties.

344
00:28:02,12 --> 00:28:08,28
Part. Yes. Oh yes most definitely.

345
00:28:08,80 --> 00:28:14,24
It was an acceptance of men
sexuality gay men sexuality

346
00:28:14,24 --> 00:28:19,68
and it made it a very safe place for us
to go and to talk about such things.

347
00:28:21,59 --> 00:28:27,50
And it was a very open many doors for
me and i'm sure hundreds of other man.

348
00:28:27,52 --> 00:28:32,48
I don't know how the news got around
the planet but often we'd go to.

349
00:28:32,65 --> 00:28:37,14
Spring retreats or summer retreat and
there be men from germany and america

350
00:28:37,14 --> 00:28:43,20
and so it soon become quite global. And it
was a wonderful place for men to go to.

351
00:28:43,42 --> 00:28:49,79
From all over the world and this
actual. Country of our own.

352
00:28:49,81 --> 00:28:55,75
Time. Yeah i'm not too sure
how it was advertised and.

353
00:28:56,46 --> 00:28:57,85
But.

354
00:28:58,60 --> 00:29:00,16
Word of mouth certainly got around

355
00:29:00,16 --> 00:29:06,49
and there were lots of different types of
things we'd get up to like maypole and.

356
00:29:06,50 --> 00:29:11,24
Yeah this chanting the moon up over
10 days and stuff like that was good

357
00:29:11,24 --> 00:29:20,54
and powerful.

358
00:29:22,99 --> 00:29:30,46
Yeah well i'd say it was one of the first.

359
00:29:30,47 --> 00:29:35,69
Yeah. The. The hippie
movement were very excepting.

360
00:29:35,71 --> 00:29:40,97
To the gay movement which was still very
young in this country at that stage

361
00:29:40,97 --> 00:29:47,03
and. Yeah we felt very well
accepted in the community.

362
00:29:47,57 --> 00:29:48,67
And.

363
00:29:48,68 --> 00:29:53,60
And we also felt as though we could be
part of it with learning about gardening

364
00:29:53,60 --> 00:29:54,97
and.

365
00:29:54,99 --> 00:29:59,64
Ways of living in the country without a
pushbutton toilet and without electricity.

366
00:30:00,80 --> 00:30:04,12
Those good good training for
us to move to the bush.

367
00:30:04,41 --> 00:30:06,90
It gave us the insight
that we can live like this

368
00:30:06,90 --> 00:30:09,10
and we can actually dig gardens

369
00:30:09,10 --> 00:30:17,63
and do without the modern side of life.

370
00:30:18,57 --> 00:30:23,35
Oh yeah.

371
00:30:24,15 --> 00:30:28,06
Yeah well there's more and more i
believe gay men moving from melbourne

372
00:30:28,06 --> 00:30:28,71
and sydney

373
00:30:28,71 --> 00:30:34,34
and brisbane to this area
because one it's so beautiful

374
00:30:35,09 --> 00:30:40,03
and to the nimbin people are
very very exacting to it.

375
00:30:40,96 --> 00:30:45,00
And. I like the idea of walking
arm in arm with my lover.

376
00:30:45,22 --> 00:30:50,34
Down in street and not having abuse
yelled out of the car windows

377
00:30:50,34 --> 00:30:53,62
or people actually commenting
in a negative way.

378
00:30:55,70 --> 00:31:00,36
You. Sure.

379
00:31:00,55 --> 00:31:06,36
Well i've been on tangible now just for
12 months but yeah i deny the people

380
00:31:06,36 --> 00:31:08,39
that are there i felt very at home there

381
00:31:08,39 --> 00:31:13,64
and people are very
accepting to who i am and.

382
00:31:13,66 --> 00:31:18,26
You know the colour is great out there
people from all over the world living there

383
00:31:18,26 --> 00:31:22,46
now and i think that's added
to a lot of the colour

384
00:31:22,46 --> 00:31:26,27
that they're in the children also aren't
little well there's not a lot of little

385
00:31:26,27 --> 00:31:30,25
children like baby there now there's
actually young kids and teenagers

386
00:31:30,25 --> 00:31:31,69
that have grown up there.

387
00:31:33,17 --> 00:31:36,79
Which i've had no trouble with at all
when i pick them up on the motorbike

388
00:31:36,79 --> 00:31:37,31
or in the car

389
00:31:37,31 --> 00:31:41,11
or with whether they're galloping past
on the horses they've always got a smile

390
00:31:42,07 --> 00:31:43,37
and.

391
00:31:43,39 --> 00:31:48,11
Yeah it doesn't seem to be a heavy prejudice
coming from their parents about who we

392
00:31:48,11 --> 00:31:50,96
should be or who we are
all don't talk to them.
