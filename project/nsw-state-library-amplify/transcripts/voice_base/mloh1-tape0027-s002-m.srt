1
00:00:06,66 --> 00:00:13,03
How did you get involved with the dreadnought
boy scheme. Well i'd always wanted to

2
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:19,93
to either go to sea or immigrate.
First of all i tried to join the

3
00:00:21,43 --> 00:00:28,21
but much marine and things were
very bad in around that time

4
00:00:28,21 --> 00:00:35,08
in the middle twenties i couldn't
get get on anything like that. I

5
00:00:35,09 --> 00:00:41,72
tried to go to canada and they told me
that i was too old that they wanted boys

6
00:00:41,72 --> 00:00:48,33
people in sixteen and seventeen and i was
almost eighteen. So i was determined to

7
00:00:48,33 --> 00:00:55,17
do something and i went to
the immigration officers of

8
00:00:56,00 --> 00:01:01,06
australia house i can't remember where
i was in new castle. Where i lived and

9
00:01:03,66 --> 00:01:09,93
i fell in papers for to
go to australia. I was

10
00:01:11,08 --> 00:01:13,58
i think eighteen by then
and of course i was

11
00:01:14,64 --> 00:01:21,63
a man and i didn't need parent
permission. So i was accep

12
00:01:21,63 --> 00:01:28,36
pted and the next thing
was i received papers and

13
00:01:28,36 --> 00:01:34,72
everything to sail on the bendigo from
tilbury docks. I think 27th or 28th

14
00:01:34,72 --> 00:01:41,58
of april nineteen twenty stephan.
We were two months at sea

15
00:01:41,58 --> 00:01:47,29
or two months and two days i'm not too
sure. Again. But we did land in sydney

16
00:01:48,89 --> 00:01:55,58
roughly towards the end of june. And where
did you get your first job. Well we were

17
00:01:55,58 --> 00:02:02,45
we were sent as dreadnought boys we were
sent on to an agricultural sort. Not

18
00:02:02,45 --> 00:02:05,51
a college actually but it
was an experimental farm

19
00:02:05,51 --> 00:02:12,15
a government experimental farm and we will
all sent up to glen innes or rather our

20
00:02:12,16 --> 00:02:19,04
batch was on the ship there were
other boys. I think i'm not

21
00:02:19,04 --> 00:02:24,08
sure that they weren't doctor but now those
are something big brother movement or

22
00:02:24,08 --> 00:02:29,30
something. I'm not too sure i do know that
we were sent to glen innes and what did

23
00:02:29,30 --> 00:02:36,19
you do there. Well we had we were supposed
to learn how we learned about pigs and

24
00:02:36,19 --> 00:02:42,84
sheep and cattle horses
plowing this kind of thing

25
00:02:42,84 --> 00:02:44,76
but was that like well you with

26
00:02:44,76 --> 00:02:50,83
a well i enjoyed it. The only thing was
we didn't get any pay. We got we got our

27
00:02:50,83 --> 00:02:57,67
keep we had no money and they
weren't many jobs either

28
00:02:57,67 --> 00:03:04,67
coming in. Farming. So i was
there i think nearly four months

29
00:03:07,07 --> 00:03:12,87
and finally we three of us
ran away. To get neutral

30
00:03:14,46 --> 00:03:20,00
not really. We ran away. We jumped the
train from from england in this. We walked

31
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:24,22
into the town. And jumped

32
00:03:24,22 --> 00:03:30,21
a good train up over the border in those
days i'd want gallo which was the border.

33
00:03:30,23 --> 00:03:36,96
They had to tranship the
the goods from one line

34
00:03:36,97 --> 00:03:40,65
into another line because they were different
gauge railways. I don't know whether

35
00:03:40,65 --> 00:03:47,27
they're saying now. But anyway. We got off
it. Well and gather. And started to walk

36
00:03:47,27 --> 00:03:53,44
toward queensland and on the way we met
tramps or sundowners as they were in those

37
00:03:53,44 --> 00:03:58,21
days. Why then the coming back. I said is
no good going there you'll get no work

38
00:03:58,21 --> 00:04:04,83
there. So we turned back. And i one of us.
There was a job but while and gather on

39
00:04:04,83 --> 00:04:11,06
a sheep station and we tossed up for it
and two of us lost the past this irish

40
00:04:11,06 --> 00:04:17,40
fellow by the name of percy edgar he got
the job. So where did you go then. Then we

41
00:04:17,40 --> 00:04:24,40
headed south jumping trains again till
we got to new castle because this

42
00:04:24,40 --> 00:04:25,82
friend i was with had

43
00:04:25,82 --> 00:04:32,65
a brother in newcastle working in the
coal mines and his proper of course took

44
00:04:32,65 --> 00:04:36,49
him in you couldn't get him work but he
took him in the couldn't take me and that

45
00:04:36,49 --> 00:04:41,97
left me alone. And i had
to go then hunting alone

46
00:04:43,77 --> 00:04:49,01
and i wandered up the north
coast till i got to cooper nick

47
00:04:50,64 --> 00:04:54,82
and i got a job there. On

48
00:04:54,83 --> 00:05:00,93
a punt going across i think it was
the manning river taking traffic

49
00:05:01,97 --> 00:05:06,29
to towards harrington and i used to

50
00:05:09,33 --> 00:05:14,75
take this ponto over with an
ordinary you and you know on

51
00:05:14,75 --> 00:05:18,73
a rope and i used to have to wind it across
and get to the other side of the river

52
00:05:18,73 --> 00:05:25,42
with full heart or a load of cattle and
things like this in between times i did

53
00:05:25,42 --> 00:05:30,76
a little milking for this man he
had a small small small holding

54
00:05:30,76 --> 00:05:37,56
a small dairy farm and his
name was hinton by the way i

55
00:05:37,57 --> 00:05:44,36
don't know where they are
now. Hum. I was in that job

56
00:05:44,36 --> 00:05:48,51
until a man came across the pumped. With

57
00:05:48,51 --> 00:05:53,47
a lorry load of bricks and cement and
sand and stuff and of course since i'd

58
00:05:53,47 --> 00:05:58,97
already done bricklaying i
asked him for a job and i got

59
00:05:58,97 --> 00:06:05,57
a job with him you had no inkling where
in england i had an england yes i had

60
00:06:06,41 --> 00:06:13,32
and i gave my notice in there
and went to tarry where this

61
00:06:13,32 --> 00:06:18,32
man lived his name was davies
dave davies long dead i imagine

62
00:06:20,72 --> 00:06:22,39
because i was only
eighteen and he would be

63
00:06:22,39 --> 00:06:28,46
a man perhaps forty over forty was here
and then from there he went to sydney and

64
00:06:28,47 --> 00:06:33,93
from there i went to sydney. Yes. So we
caught up with you back there were down to

65
00:06:33,93 --> 00:06:36,67
the harbour bridge again did you get any
other work before you were on the ridge.

66
00:06:37,67 --> 00:06:41,60
Yes yes. The first job i
got in sydney was for

67
00:06:41,60 --> 00:06:46,19
a man by name of neilson he had

68
00:06:46,19 --> 00:06:51,10
a small box factory. I think
it was in elizabeth street

69
00:06:53,57 --> 00:06:58,85
waterloo fire i can't quite remember. I
think it was elizabeth street waterloo. He

70
00:06:58,85 --> 00:06:59,10
had

71
00:06:59,10 --> 00:07:07,51
a box factory making boxes and
that was my first job in sydney.

72
00:07:07,53 --> 00:07:12,79
And when you had finished up on the bridge.
Incidentally do you remember any any

73
00:07:12,79 --> 00:07:16,47
incidents while you were working on the
approaches there that were the stand in

74
00:07:16,47 --> 00:07:18,36
your mind when musing on whether

75
00:07:18,36 --> 00:07:23,95
a tough incident. No not really no there
was only the one incident where the man

76
00:07:23,95 --> 00:07:30,67
the man went up climbed on the steelworks
the reinforcing you know before it was

77
00:07:30,67 --> 00:07:36,59
concreted and he just lost his nerve and
just couldn't get down wouldn't move

78
00:07:37,95 --> 00:07:43,30
and it took all day to get him down.
How did they get into. Well they just

79
00:07:43,30 --> 00:07:48,66
manhandled them down. I don't know i actually.
Why don't they had to give him drugs

80
00:07:48,66 --> 00:07:53,30
or anything but they did get him down but
it was after five o'clock when they did

81
00:07:53,30 --> 00:07:57,100
get him down as well as he was finished
up immediately. I would imagine. I don't

82
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,97
know what happened to him but he would be

83
00:08:00,97 --> 00:08:07,67
a nervous wreck anyway. Who what when
you finished up after the several

84
00:08:07,68 --> 00:08:13,73
months that you spent in the various parts
of the ash felting the what job did you

85
00:08:13,73 --> 00:08:20,66
get after that. Um i the only jobs i
had after that i still did little

86
00:08:20,66 --> 00:08:25,91
bits and pieces with this with these
two brothers of asphalt work.

87
00:08:28,61 --> 00:08:33,13
I also got a job and i
think at the time it was

88
00:08:33,13 --> 00:08:38,49
a wolf's building that they were building
in sydney around about the time i left as

89
00:08:38,49 --> 00:08:43,14
a matter of fact i left that job to catch
the boat at circular quay to go back to

90
00:08:43,14 --> 00:08:49,38
england. And. When you got back to it. We
were on the dole in australia at all. No

91
00:08:50,68 --> 00:08:56,51
no. You see he went no when they first
there wasn't any dole when i first got to

92
00:08:56,51 --> 00:09:02,40
sydney and it was only i think nineteen
twenty nine that they had to start

93
00:09:02,40 --> 00:09:07,86
a form of rationing because not having
the old people out of work they were

94
00:09:07,86 --> 00:09:14,83
starving and they open row of some circular
quay to dish out rations. First of

95
00:09:14,83 --> 00:09:21,38
all two or three loaves of bread to purpose
and depending on family bit of butter

96
00:09:21,38 --> 00:09:26,64
and meat and what have we. And then
of course they had to bring in

97
00:09:26,64 --> 00:09:32,85
a scheme where they paid money. First of
all it was coupons. To give to you. Gross

98
00:09:32,85 --> 00:09:39,03
and then it was money later but i never
applied for it being single. I somehow used

99
00:09:39,03 --> 00:09:40,35
to manage to get

100
00:09:40,35 --> 00:09:46,61
a little bit of work here and there you
know. And so avoided going for the door and

101
00:09:46,62 --> 00:09:50,68
win. So you went back to england then and
did you have to pay your fare. I mean how

102
00:09:50,68 --> 00:09:56,22
do you do for the mother sent my ticket.
So you managed to get back to england when

103
00:09:56,22 --> 00:10:00,50
you've got back there. Did you manage to
get work. Oh yes yes i got work right away

104
00:10:00,50 --> 00:10:05,59
and i never looked back. Really.
I was in london and quite

105
00:10:05,59 --> 00:10:12,24
a lot before the war broke out intending
to come back to australia. I always

106
00:10:12,24 --> 00:10:18,37
wanted to do that as soon as things improved.
However the war. I got married. First

107
00:10:18,37 --> 00:10:25,02
of all and that put an end to it for the
time being but we did intend to immigrate

108
00:10:25,02 --> 00:10:30,88
. And then of all progs out and
put paid to it. And can you make

109
00:10:30,88 --> 00:10:32,97
a comparison of what things were like in

110
00:10:32,97 --> 00:10:39,04
a stroller and what things were like in
england when you got back when i'm in only

111
00:10:39,04 --> 00:10:45,08
thirty four. Oh yes and it was i.

112
00:10:45,83 --> 00:10:52,56
I think i've already told you that
the trouble in europe was already

113
00:10:52,57 --> 00:10:59,11
starting to you know
make itself felt and i

114
00:10:59,12 --> 00:11:06,10
think the government was looking
to to sort of get factory is

115
00:11:06,10 --> 00:11:10,83
going that they could use in
wartime. And they started

116
00:11:10,83 --> 00:11:17,69
a lot of schemes in england i think they
starve them and about 1935. What they call

117
00:11:17,69 --> 00:11:24,04
the shadow factory schemes and
in the north east. They built

118
00:11:24,04 --> 00:11:25,37
they filled in

119
00:11:26,83 --> 00:11:33,69
a big swamp drained it. And
build factories on that on that

120
00:11:33,69 --> 00:11:36,88
land. Let them out. I think at a pound

121
00:11:36,88 --> 00:11:40,72
a week or something very very cheap rent
so they can just tell them when they want

122
00:11:40,72 --> 00:11:41,06
to die at

123
00:11:41,06 --> 00:11:47,36
a minute's notice to get out. Which they
did issues war broke out. They put them

124
00:11:47,36 --> 00:11:51,63
out and made them into munitions factories
that was the north east the team that

125
00:11:51,63 --> 00:11:57,78
trading estate and they were lots of
those all over england but as i said in

126
00:11:57,78 --> 00:12:04,74
1934 1935 they were starting to
prepare for the trouble in europe but

127
00:12:04,74 --> 00:12:09,87
australia was much much worse than than
ever the oh yes they were simply because

128
00:12:09,87 --> 00:12:11,84
australia didn't have

129
00:12:11,84 --> 00:12:18,36
a lot by way of australian
manufactured goods and

130
00:12:20,16 --> 00:12:25,31
well nobody would would invest money in
australia especially at that time at that

131
00:12:25,31 --> 00:12:29,99
time you see the population was only
seven million people. And a million and

132
00:12:29,99 --> 00:12:35,95
a half of them were in sydney and then
we don't mention lying or the their own

133
00:12:35,95 --> 00:12:39,32
egging on the on the bondholders mr.

134
00:12:39,33 --> 00:12:45,87
Jack lang you see he he he closed the banks
actually cut out well it was mr jack

135
00:12:45,87 --> 00:12:51,50
lang. Well it wasn't it was the veteran
government that the bank shares but

136
00:12:53,21 --> 00:12:58,69
the problem was there anyway. Can i ask
you something. Let's not get into the

137
00:12:59,67 --> 00:13:05,04
philosophical end of it. Can you think of
anything else outstanding while you were

138
00:13:05,04 --> 00:13:11,64
working around the bridge. No no
nothing outstanding it was just

139
00:13:11,64 --> 00:13:17,77
a matter of survival just work as
much as i can get. Yes twelve hours

140
00:13:17,77 --> 00:13:24,02
a day and very hot as well and dirty
as well. Hot and very dirty yes yes

141
00:13:24,84 --> 00:13:28,02
yes i've seen some of the pictures of those
felting clouds you can't see them for

142
00:13:28,02 --> 00:13:34,28
smoke. Yes yes they are very
very hot and dirty. Yes

143
00:13:35,47 --> 00:13:38,12
you know i don't know how they go on
pollution in those days because it will

144
00:13:38,12 --> 00:13:42,89
incredible i mean the smoke. Well i don't
think there was the pollution of this

145
00:13:42,89 --> 00:13:48,57
today because they weren't the motor cars
about anyway it was more black smoke. Oh

146
00:13:48,58 --> 00:13:49,67
yes. How

147
00:13:49,67 --> 00:13:56,55
a small black smoke but
they were more horses to.

148
00:13:57,70 --> 00:13:59,84
Demean what you did in the
spare time when you had

149
00:13:59,84 --> 00:14:03,37
a little bit of money.
I used to go sometimes

150
00:14:03,37 --> 00:14:07,77
a rush covers by stadium. I used to

151
00:14:07,77 --> 00:14:11,74
a little bit of skating.
I used to do quite

152
00:14:11,74 --> 00:14:16,30
a bit of surfing. Where did
you skate at rush covers bay.

153
00:14:19,35 --> 00:14:23,36
I think that was where it was which
is an ice rink a roller rink. It was

154
00:14:23,36 --> 00:14:29,02
a roller skating rink and the surfing. Oh
i used to go to the mall bond i could be

155
00:14:30,57 --> 00:14:37,01
brought here you know and i was
there you know i went round and all

156
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:45,69
you see the cookie barn and these
places partly by which to swim in

157
00:14:45,69 --> 00:14:50,80
botany bay before there were any of the oil
installations runny thing in those days

158
00:14:50,80 --> 00:14:57,55
impotently bay. When we went there. We
could walk out all we could walk out.

159
00:14:57,66 --> 00:14:59,19
Damn near a quarter of

160
00:14:59,19 --> 00:15:05,82
a mile. You know and still just be waist
deep in water in the part of botany bay we

161
00:15:05,82 --> 00:15:12,43
used as women to rember anything
else is to do it is pertinent. No

162
00:15:12,44 --> 00:15:19,19
only mind around looking for
work and lying in the park at

163
00:15:21,17 --> 00:15:27,96
and darlington darlington i think
it all. And the main park. Of

164
00:15:27,96 --> 00:15:31,50
course hyde park there when you had

165
00:15:31,50 --> 00:15:36,83
a bit of money. I mean when you're in work.
Well i used to do all i used to be at

166
00:15:36,83 --> 00:15:42,18
the beaches every weekend we used to go
swimming. I used to love it. Swimming you

167
00:15:42,19 --> 00:15:46,87
go to the theatre or the pictures. Oh yes
yes. I used to go. I was there when the

168
00:15:46,87 --> 00:15:52,76
class of was opened which i think as
i remember it was round about 1933

169
00:15:55,31 --> 00:15:59,09
that the plaza cinema was
open new brand new with

170
00:15:59,10 --> 00:16:03,90
a picture silent or talk is there no they
were talking stand the talk is came in i

171
00:16:03,90 --> 00:16:10,71
think iran about 1929 and the first
talkies we got in sydney who were world

172
00:16:10,71 --> 00:16:15,79
full length talkies they were part of
our only half and half half silent half

173
00:16:15,79 --> 00:16:22,49
talking. That was the first ones for the
first few months and then we have the full

174
00:16:22,49 --> 00:16:29,46
length talking picture. To remember straight
in films being shown at that. Yes but

175
00:16:30,34 --> 00:16:32,97
that now before the talkies
i remember there was

176
00:16:32,97 --> 00:16:39,76
a film for the term of his natural
life. That one. I think i

177
00:16:39,76 --> 00:16:46,48
saw that one in tari or or it might have
been open to the travelling film show

178
00:16:46,48 --> 00:16:53,35
silent films show and we see go every
saturday night i used to ride in on horseback

179
00:16:54,30 --> 00:17:00,84
into the town and the travelling day it
was in the school of arts and they had

180
00:17:00,84 --> 00:17:06,55
these little benches that you sat on just
ordinary hard benches everybody sat on

181
00:17:08,01 --> 00:17:08,29
and watched

182
00:17:08,29 --> 00:17:14,56
a silent film that was before i went to
sydney. How much do they charge to remember

183
00:17:15,51 --> 00:17:16,66
i think there that was

184
00:17:16,66 --> 00:17:23,45
a sixpence. But in
sydney event i think was

185
00:17:23,45 --> 00:17:30,30
a shilling ninepence or something
like that in sydney and i used to go

186
00:17:30,30 --> 00:17:36,80
to the state theatre. I think it was the
prince harry's i'm not too sure. And of

187
00:17:36,80 --> 00:17:43,50
course the plaza the old
tivoli was pulled down i

188
00:17:43,50 --> 00:17:48,41
think around about the time that i arrived
in sydney from tower read the old

189
00:17:48,41 --> 00:17:53,07
everleigh with the old music hall. Do
you remember the opening of the sydney

190
00:17:53,07 --> 00:18:00,00
harbour bridge were you in sydney. Even
though yes i was i was there i was in the

191
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:06,19
crowds on the bridge and i watched the
incident. I could see the commotion

192
00:18:07,09 --> 00:18:11,83
that was going on with captain the good
part of course i couldn't. Know binoculars

193
00:18:11,83 --> 00:18:15,91
anything and i couldn't tell what the
hell was going on but i knew there was

194
00:18:15,91 --> 00:18:22,20
a mind the press the press were very fast
quick on the street with the news where

195
00:18:22,21 --> 00:18:27,59
it happened it was on the street at no
time. Remember that particularly i do. I

196
00:18:27,59 --> 00:18:34,32
remember it very yes it's very vivid that
day the crowds and everything and i would

197
00:18:34,32 --> 00:18:40,62
say i had probably not as many people as
there were on sunday but there were crowds

198
00:18:40,62 --> 00:18:41,02
of people

199
00:18:41,81 --> 00:18:46,54
a lot of people we were still working on
the bridge after it was open where you

200
00:18:46,54 --> 00:18:52,87
know. No i finish working
before all it was opened that

201
00:18:53,60 --> 00:18:53,80
there were

202
00:18:53,80 --> 00:18:57,65
a few people still working on it. Afterwards
i understand. I think there must have

203
00:18:57,65 --> 00:19:04,09
been the must have been maintenance men
would be on it all the time and possibly

204
00:19:04,09 --> 00:19:09,73
they were painting it still i don't know.
And i don't know relying on us and other

205
00:19:09,73 --> 00:19:16,38
information. No i don't think
there were many working on it.

206
00:19:16,43 --> 00:19:22,34
Actually after it opened
other than maintenance and

207
00:19:23,61 --> 00:19:29,90
maybe possibly putting up the the barriers
for the for the toll gates you know.

208
00:19:31,14 --> 00:19:33,28
Yes well thank you very much mr. Evans.
