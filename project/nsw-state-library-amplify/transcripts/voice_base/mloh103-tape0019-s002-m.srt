1
00:00:09,86 --> 00:00:12,08
Challenges yes.

2
00:00:12,10 --> 00:00:13,35
Challenges from them

3
00:00:13,35 --> 00:00:19,40
but there was a time i think it was perhaps
five six maybe even seven years ago.

4
00:00:19,54 --> 00:00:20,92
It appeared that the.

5
00:00:21,59 --> 00:00:25,06
The whole smack scene was getting out of
control in the streets in the manikin you

6
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:28,82
know and then that that it seemed
to go through a period of.

7
00:00:29,39 --> 00:00:33,04
Easing off i don't know if economic
conditions in the outside world have an

8
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:37,78
interview with the fluctuating number
of junkies that seem to come to town.

9
00:00:38,95 --> 00:00:43,23
It appears from what i've heard to be
going to another upswing right now.

10
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:49,43
I mean it's obviously a shame for the
people who work in the mine to shame people

11
00:00:49,43 --> 00:00:53,73
who are on the smack to you
know shame for everyone

12
00:00:54,69 --> 00:00:58,96
but i don't think it's it's anything
that will drag the town under

13
00:00:58,96 --> 00:01:04,45
and see the town becoming because it sounds
just like a visual manifestation of a

14
00:01:04,45 --> 00:01:07,12
lot larger corps of people you know

15
00:01:07,12 --> 00:01:10,07
and there are thousands of people you
never see in the streets of town

16
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:11,64
that are out in the hills

17
00:01:11,64 --> 00:01:17,62
that perhaps don't shop in the main
because i don't like the in-town feeling

18
00:01:17,62 --> 00:01:18,67
but they're still around.

19
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:25,70
I don't i can't see any real
challenges that nimbin can't succumb.

20
00:01:25,85 --> 00:01:29,54
I think the tourist challenge is perhaps
the biggest one we've faced yet in a lot

21
00:01:29,54 --> 00:01:29,90
of ways

22
00:01:29,90 --> 00:01:35,86
and a lot of people who are very strongly
about it you know very anti tourist don't

23
00:01:35,87 --> 00:01:40,21
come staring at us. So i think we're
just living our life piss off.

24
00:01:41,28 --> 00:01:42,08
I don't want a few tourists.

25
00:01:43,85 --> 00:01:49,28
That's what we are if we
go overseas a challenge.

26
00:01:49,33 --> 00:01:51,75
Yeah i can't see anything that
that's going to bring us down.

27
00:01:52,82 --> 00:01:58,17
We'll just go from strength to
strength. Take over the world.

28
00:01:58,18 --> 00:01:59,64
Nim into day tomorrow.

29
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:06,61
The universe to pleasure.

30
00:02:06,63 --> 00:02:07,95
Okay.

31
00:02:09,03 --> 00:02:14,41
My most fun celebration by bob is.

32
00:02:14,42 --> 00:02:20,00
The one that really sticks in my
mind was the house warming party

33
00:02:20,00 --> 00:02:24,91
that we gave when with
finished building our house.

34
00:02:24,95 --> 00:02:27,16
Don and myself and.

35
00:02:27,67 --> 00:02:34,67
We'd planned our house warming of at
least six months before it happened

36
00:02:34,67 --> 00:02:34,83
and.

37
00:02:35,94 --> 00:02:40,55
Had a very optimistic attitude as to how
long it would take us to build this house

38
00:02:40,55 --> 00:02:43,46
that we were building.
Having never wielded hammer

39
00:02:43,46 --> 00:02:45,83
and sold before in my life
i didn't own any tools

40
00:02:45,83 --> 00:02:50,69
and i had a buy my first hammer and
so when i wanted to build a house.

41
00:02:51,64 --> 00:02:57,89
And we do this house we'd had a fiat little
bit of a problem with the council in

42
00:02:57,89 --> 00:03:00,42
terms of forgetting to
contact them first about it

43
00:03:01,52 --> 00:03:06,80
and he had issued us the stop work notices
only weeks before the party was due.

44
00:03:07,90 --> 00:03:08,00
But

45
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:14,79
when it eventuated the they had we'd moved
into the house 24 hours before the party

46
00:03:15,81 --> 00:03:20,85
and had no furniture had
nothing in the house at all.

47
00:03:20,86 --> 00:03:26,99
And maybe one hundred fifty people turned
up out in the middle of nowhere like

48
00:03:28,12 --> 00:03:30,40
to me it seemed like it was right
in the middle of the bush.

49
00:03:30,85 --> 00:03:34,02
There was no other houses you could
see first far as the eye could see.

50
00:03:34,57 --> 00:03:39,99
And there were all these people in my house
and everybody had brought a cushion.

51
00:03:40,01 --> 00:03:46,79
And it was just wonderful. I
went for about two days. And.

52
00:03:46,81 --> 00:03:48,03
Stuck in my mind

53
00:03:48,75 --> 00:03:54,75
and stuck right there in this image of this
wonderful party was his close friend of

54
00:03:54,75 --> 00:03:59,68
mine who had just got out of hospital two
days before after being in traction for

55
00:03:59,68 --> 00:04:01,82
six. A month with a broken
hip from a car accident

56
00:04:01,82 --> 00:04:05,69
and he sat in the one
arm chair that we had

57
00:04:05,69 --> 00:04:07,80
that somebody had brought
an arm chair for him

58
00:04:09,09 --> 00:04:11,64
and he sat in his chair all all night

59
00:04:11,64 --> 00:04:17,90
and most of the next day with a big smile
is life. And it was just wonderful.

60
00:04:18,13 --> 00:04:22,86
Diana had made some rather
overly strong cookies

61
00:04:22,86 --> 00:04:28,43
and everybody had a really wonderful time.

62
00:04:31,99 --> 00:04:37,67
To do what it's so great. Oh yes.

63
00:04:38,77 --> 00:04:40,23
I love of a good party.

64
00:04:40,33 --> 00:04:45,83
I think is the common thread and
the the bonding that people get

65
00:04:46,58 --> 00:04:52,08
when you have a really big happy successful
celebration together you know it's

66
00:04:52,08 --> 00:04:55,49
there it's the old farm
is greater than the all

67
00:04:55,49 --> 00:04:58,76
that the whole is greater than some of
the parts of i was trying to say is that

68
00:05:00,37 --> 00:05:02,09
when there's a group get
together to celebrate

69
00:05:02,09 --> 00:05:09,04
and it's a good working celebration
it seems to achieve something you

70
00:05:09,04 --> 00:05:14,09
know that that feeling of unity. I think
that a lot of people need to continually.

71
00:05:15,40 --> 00:05:19,92
Reassert and reestablish that feeling
of unity with their kindred spirits.

72
00:05:21,11 --> 00:05:24,61
I think that's perhaps one of the
binding forces in the area is

73
00:05:24,61 --> 00:05:31,49
that feeling of kindred spirit
when the people who are here.

74
00:05:32,21 --> 00:05:36,72
Hi i'm jill. Jill jones and i came here.

75
00:05:37,27 --> 00:05:40,71
19 actually went away
for a couple of years

76
00:05:40,71 --> 00:05:43,27
and then came back to live
permanently in eighty two.

77
00:05:43,61 --> 00:05:44,10
I think it was

78
00:05:44,10 --> 00:05:49,10
when my son was old enough to go to school
he needed a bit of a base and before

79
00:05:49,10 --> 00:05:54,96
that i was a travelling hippy and.

80
00:05:54,98 --> 00:05:59,61
Now i've found after living in the bush
and having babies and building houses.

81
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,57
Which i've loved to do and
growing vegetables and all

82
00:06:02,57 --> 00:06:09,41
that it's now i've needed something a
bit more creative to find meaning in my

83
00:06:09,41 --> 00:06:10,61
life with if you like.

84
00:06:10,76 --> 00:06:17,50
So i've established a fabric painting
business which i really love to do

85
00:06:18,56 --> 00:06:22,51
and it's brought me
closer to a lot of people

86
00:06:22,51 --> 00:06:28,02
and i've been able to share my skills with
a lot of people in nimbin get some of

87
00:06:28,02 --> 00:06:33,28
the kids a bit more inspired and but more
motivated into doing something creative.

88
00:06:33,31 --> 00:06:34,81
Which makes them feel really
good about themselves.

89
00:06:37,30 --> 00:06:39,47
And i've got a great shed
that i work and from home.

90
00:06:40,09 --> 00:06:45,36
Which is i'm very lucky i'm one of the
few houses here that's got mains power.

91
00:06:45,38 --> 00:06:49,57
So i couldn't do it otherwise it irons
and over lockers and that sort of thing

92
00:06:50,63 --> 00:06:50,64
and

93
00:06:51,61 --> 00:06:56,47
and attracts a lot of people here into the
community of diverse people i've had a

94
00:06:56,47 --> 00:06:59,85
woman from the gold coast in fact yesterday
who came down who's interested in

95
00:06:59,85 --> 00:07:01,13
marketing some of the gear

96
00:07:02,36 --> 00:07:06,70
and it's really interesting
to have a focal point like

97
00:07:06,70 --> 00:07:08,48
that to attract all these
sort of different people.

98
00:07:08,81 --> 00:07:11,28
And it's a good meeting point

99
00:07:12,53 --> 00:07:17,44
and it's also good for the you know the
broader area to have a bit of an economy.

100
00:07:17,60 --> 00:07:21,12
You know and. You know being
able to generate money

101
00:07:21,12 --> 00:07:25,07
and also the tourists coming into the area
there are all wanting something unusual

102
00:07:25,07 --> 00:07:28,16
to take away with them and there's very
few things all that's getting more

103
00:07:28,16 --> 00:07:32,55
and more products in the shops for
people to buy and take away so

104
00:07:33,68 --> 00:07:43,21
that that's a big part of it as well.

105
00:07:44,41 --> 00:07:48,97
As well. We live. Yeah.
Living in the bush.

106
00:07:49,08 --> 00:07:53,05
I mean you just look out the window
and it's just so inspiring this

107
00:07:53,05 --> 00:07:56,74
and it's all so new in the so
much diversity and patterns

108
00:07:56,74 --> 00:07:59,90
and colours within the
people the environment.

109
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:01,58
It's the conversations

110
00:08:01,58 --> 00:08:05,87
that you have it's all feeding you constantly
i often thought if i move back to the

111
00:08:05,87 --> 00:08:08,37
city. I don't think i could be
as creative because it sort of.

112
00:08:08,77 --> 00:08:12,38
It sucks you i think whereas
here at nourishes you the bush

113
00:08:13,34 --> 00:08:15,45
and there's always different ideas

114
00:08:15,45 --> 00:08:19,44
and different color schemes you know
on a wet day i'd tend to do so.

115
00:08:19,52 --> 00:08:23,69
Grey blue purple he colours and on a
hot sunny day it's all red and orange

116
00:08:23,69 --> 00:08:27,89
and yellow. Yeah.

117
00:08:27,91 --> 00:08:33,13
About.

118
00:08:34,55 --> 00:08:39,44
Yeah i came here with a three year old at
first he hated the city because we lived

119
00:08:39,44 --> 00:08:43,45
very when i lived in new zealand we didn't
have we didn't believe in any money.

120
00:08:43,47 --> 00:08:49,60
We live totally sustainably we used to
pick mussels off the rocks and sell them

121
00:08:49,60 --> 00:08:53,77
and sex once a month we had a
boat and the money we made from

122
00:08:53,77 --> 00:08:57,89
that we bought sex of rice
exit wheat and sex of sugar

123
00:08:57,89 --> 00:09:01,62
and we used to fish in those
wild pork and those cry fish

124
00:09:01,62 --> 00:09:07,63
and we had an incredibly abundant life
we from the land. That's all we we used.

125
00:09:07,84 --> 00:09:09,70
What was around us and

126
00:09:09,71 --> 00:09:12,93
when i first came to nimbin from new
zealand i couldn't believe coming to them

127
00:09:12,93 --> 00:09:16,30
bingeing nobody had vegetables
in the ground like i thought.

128
00:09:16,54 --> 00:09:19,32
They're just playing at being
a alternative you know

129
00:09:20,51 --> 00:09:23,67
and it took me awhile to get used to
that i mean the australian government

130
00:09:23,67 --> 00:09:24,47
and its magnanimity

131
00:09:25,60 --> 00:09:30,01
or whatever the word as just paid us to
live here in paradise so i thought oh well

132
00:09:30,01 --> 00:09:31,45
that's ok. I thank you very much.

133
00:09:32,67 --> 00:09:35,15
And now i can get into other things
apart from growing vegetables

134
00:09:35,15 --> 00:09:40,35
and you know doing the basics and i think
we've been very very lucky for years

135
00:09:40,35 --> 00:09:44,53
and i don't know how long it's going
to continue but i think it's something

136
00:09:44,53 --> 00:09:46,75
that we've all got a look at that
it's not going to keep going forever

137
00:09:46,75 --> 00:09:49,61
and we do have to create
another economic base

138
00:09:49,61 --> 00:09:52,70
that there's no this
area can sustain itself

139
00:09:52,70 --> 00:09:55,40
and that's one of the challenges i guess

140
00:09:55,40 --> 00:09:59,88
that i can see for number one in
terms of creating a different akon.

141
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,88
Maybe based not on what mainstreams based
on but more viable in the sense of.

142
00:10:06,90 --> 00:10:11,83
Like you know the whole permaculture
thing the whole gamut vegetable.

143
00:10:11,84 --> 00:10:15,18
Thing and with the arts
as a lot of tourists

144
00:10:15,18 --> 00:10:18,04
and a lot of visitors
coming to the town that it.

145
00:10:18,12 --> 00:10:19,39
You know they really want things

146
00:10:19,39 --> 00:10:22,23
and they're going to waste it with money
in their pockets and empty handed.

147
00:10:22,33 --> 00:10:25,89
So you know there's a very there's a
really big market and there that has to be

148
00:10:25,89 --> 00:10:31,69
that would be good to tap
into in a positive way.

149
00:10:32,75 --> 00:10:38,35
Is possible. No because
survival as very hard.

150
00:10:38,45 --> 00:10:41,55
That's what i found in new zealand for
three years survival was number one

151
00:10:41,55 --> 00:10:45,13
and you didn't have time. I mean
we had a beautiful. We had.

152
00:10:45,75 --> 00:10:47,43
You know our lifestyle was fantastic.

153
00:10:48,00 --> 00:10:50,95
What we ate what we talked about
the music we had and all that

154
00:10:50,95 --> 00:10:53,58
but it was very much of a struggle.

155
00:10:53,79 --> 00:10:58,21
You know 24 hours a day virtually you were
working all the time whereas i think the

156
00:10:58,21 --> 00:11:01,87
dole has given us the freedom to
well build nice a comfortable houses

157
00:11:02,88 --> 00:11:05,20
and it's given us a time to go off

158
00:11:05,20 --> 00:11:12,02
and you know create more interesting things
to do rather than just the toil of who

159
00:11:12,03 --> 00:11:15,82
you know.

160
00:11:17,37 --> 00:11:21,72
Happy dole bludgers yeah well
i think yeah be dull that.

161
00:11:21,74 --> 00:11:24,44
I feed as a rural subsidy.

162
00:11:24,46 --> 00:11:28,36
And i see a lot of people
doing really worthwhile

163
00:11:28,36 --> 00:11:29,88
and potent things with the money

164
00:11:29,88 --> 00:11:33,15
that we get while building a house for
example rather than being tapped into the

165
00:11:33,15 --> 00:11:37,64
mortgage belt for 40 years or whatever.
However long people get tapped into.

166
00:11:40,18 --> 00:11:44,57
And yeah it's like a subsidy to say ok
you know like you can populate this area

167
00:11:44,57 --> 00:11:47,68
but after a while i think
inherently you know

168
00:11:47,68 --> 00:11:49,98
when you've got everything pretty
well set up then it's time

169
00:11:50,69 --> 00:11:55,39
that we've got the freedom we
have got the financial pressure.

170
00:11:55,41 --> 00:11:59,71
You know that we can create these new.

171
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,29
Little industries dotted
around the countryside

172
00:12:02,29 --> 00:12:05,82
and that's the way i see no developing
with a whole lot of small business

173
00:12:07,82 --> 00:12:10,62
and really creative dynamic
things really interesting things

174
00:12:10,62 --> 00:12:12,87
that people can get
involved and feel excited

175
00:12:12,87 --> 00:12:17,92
and happy about rather than 40
hour week you know five grand

176
00:12:17,92 --> 00:12:22,11
that most people sort of see as what the
rest of the world are doing most of

177
00:12:22,11 --> 00:12:24,93
western society anyway.

178
00:12:24,95 --> 00:12:29,66
Away in a circle.

179
00:12:29,68 --> 00:12:34,70
Because the way people live in poverty
mentality is very strong here.

180
00:12:34,95 --> 00:12:41,49
I think a lot of people came to the nimbin
area to run away from the 8 to 5 grind.

181
00:12:41,50 --> 00:12:44,82
And there is a lot of faults and that
but at the same time it doesn't mean

182
00:12:44,82 --> 00:12:47,08
that all workers bad or money is bad

183
00:12:47,88 --> 00:12:51,40
that there is another way we can create
money there is another way we can work like

184
00:12:51,40 --> 00:12:55,26
the way i work you know we have a lot
of fun. It's all about fun and ok.

185
00:12:55,40 --> 00:12:58,18
Some days you don't feel very productive
and you don't be as productive

186
00:12:58,18 --> 00:13:02,62
but we did you just keep going and then
another day comes along and we're all

187
00:13:02,62 --> 00:13:07,03
and spas and creative and we
produce fantastic things.

188
00:13:07,05 --> 00:13:12,42
Yeah.

189
00:13:14,37 --> 00:13:19,80
And i think the quality of life is what we
all we all came for here for the quality

190
00:13:19,80 --> 00:13:23,80
of like bob was saying before the quality
of the union of people getting together

191
00:13:23,80 --> 00:13:28,64
and you know we talk about really important
things we talk about personal things

192
00:13:28,64 --> 00:13:32,60
that are affecting us rather than
you know what you bought last week

193
00:13:32,60 --> 00:13:33,74
and what you're going to buy tomorrow

194
00:13:33,74 --> 00:13:37,17
and what video you watch last night you
know people talk about their feelings a lot

195
00:13:37,17 --> 00:13:39,86
of people talk about.

196
00:13:39,88 --> 00:13:43,90
You know ok we get into broad overviews
like the kids the other night they were all

197
00:13:43,90 --> 00:13:47,02
here my teenage you know jake
is 15 and a few of us friends

198
00:13:47,02 --> 00:13:50,57
and they were talking about black holes
and the universe in the multiverse

199
00:13:50,57 --> 00:13:52,29
and physics and chemistry

200
00:13:52,29 --> 00:13:56,79
and all the new scientist of science stuff
that's happening all over the world you

201
00:13:56,79 --> 00:13:59,38
know in western new science circles and.

202
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,64
A lot of the kids and a lot of
adults were into very sort of broad.

203
00:14:05,37 --> 00:14:08,59
Intellectual diversity if you like here

204
00:14:09,50 --> 00:14:15,38
and i think that's because we live in such
a raw environment we've we're not like

205
00:14:15,38 --> 00:14:18,89
if you lived in europe where there's been
people living for the houses of years

206
00:14:18,89 --> 00:14:23,26
you'd sort of the somehow infiltrates
into a very bones of the be you know your

207
00:14:23,26 --> 00:14:25,54
very being. And that's
what everybody thinks

208
00:14:25,54 --> 00:14:27,99
and talks about whereas
here it's all very new

209
00:14:27,99 --> 00:14:31,99
and it's this whole new age is incredibly
strong and people's conversations

210
00:14:31,99 --> 00:14:36,63
and how they dress how
they express themselves.

211
00:14:36,65 --> 00:14:42,51
And all that sort of a sense of
some cut off from the rest of the.

212
00:14:42,53 --> 00:14:44,21
Well i've been here so
many years and that's

213
00:14:44,21 --> 00:14:47,24
when i get out there like go down
to the city. I think oh come on.

214
00:14:47,48 --> 00:14:50,76
I think you know the world changing
everyone's you know it's getting better

215
00:14:50,76 --> 00:14:54,88
and i go out there. I think oh i think
i live in a little coon up here.

216
00:14:56,17 --> 00:14:59,74
I think there is a sense of we are a bit
separate and different from everybody.

217
00:14:59,96 --> 00:15:03,88
But i think like this gold coast
woman that. Came the other day.

218
00:15:04,19 --> 00:15:07,09
She's really waking up and talking
about sort of new age stuff

219
00:15:07,09 --> 00:15:09,29
and i think it's happening all over.

220
00:15:09,77 --> 00:15:12,34
I think nimbin is a real nucleus of it

221
00:15:13,38 --> 00:15:17,20
and i think the rest of the world slowly
followings like health foods you know ten

222
00:15:17,20 --> 00:15:19,77
years ago nobody had a muesli
was everybody eats it now

223
00:15:19,77 --> 00:15:24,04
and we've been eating it for 20 years
and brown rice and tofu and all that

224
00:15:25,07 --> 00:15:30,42
and i think we are a bit of a yeah
a bit of a leader and terms of.

225
00:15:30,44 --> 00:15:35,08
Lifestyle and food and
all that sort of thing

226
00:15:35,08 --> 00:15:39,88
and via mental issues of course that's
always been top of the priority list in

227
00:15:39,89 --> 00:15:46,60
terms of people creating more sustainable
ways to live to people support.

228
00:15:46,62 --> 00:15:49,59
Personal interaction

229
00:15:49,60 --> 00:15:53,99
that way.

230
00:15:54,01 --> 00:15:59,73
It's been a lot of relationship as
you know everybody is living after.

231
00:16:01,03 --> 00:16:05,70
Well i don't see it as a negative thing
i've i say i don't see i think all the

232
00:16:05,70 --> 00:16:06,04
relationships

233
00:16:06,04 --> 00:16:09,61
that are going through really hard times
at the moment in the last few years.

234
00:16:11,13 --> 00:16:15,58
I see it as it will grow a challenge
i think it is a real growth.

235
00:16:16,38 --> 00:16:19,61
Thing for growing you have to really look
at yourself you've got to look at so many

236
00:16:19,61 --> 00:16:24,62
different issues rather than just hanging
in there was putting up with things

237
00:16:24,62 --> 00:16:27,86
that aren't you know good for
you and aren't good for kids.

238
00:16:29,36 --> 00:16:32,50
I think we all tend specially with the
women around here we all get together

239
00:16:32,50 --> 00:16:37,72
and talk a lot about our personal stuff
and relationships and that sort of thing

240
00:16:37,72 --> 00:16:41,69
and i think it's we all grow and we're
all a lot more compassionate and wise

241
00:16:41,69 --> 00:16:46,05
and more capable of having.

242
00:16:46,07 --> 00:16:49,58
Better quality relationships
than you know the average person

243
00:16:53,58 --> 00:16:55,83
watching the pressures of life.

244
00:16:56,48 --> 00:17:00,87
The pressures from living this way
or living in a quite difficult.

245
00:17:01,22 --> 00:17:07,26
I mean to you know how difficult thing to
do those pressures i mean the fact i mean

246
00:17:07,26 --> 00:17:11,90
you know i think for people living
together 24 hours or so years

247
00:17:11,90 --> 00:17:16,62
when people break up around here it's you
know we've we're living in each other's

248
00:17:16,62 --> 00:17:18,63
pockets 24 hours a day seven days a week

249
00:17:18,63 --> 00:17:21,80
and i think you do tend to get
a bit sick of each other.

250
00:17:21,91 --> 00:17:26,98
Plus the whole struggle of
surviving you know building houses

251
00:17:26,98 --> 00:17:30,42
and having babies at the same time
living in tents in the wet season and

252
00:17:31,80 --> 00:17:36,70
when you used to the old color t.v. In flush
toilets which we most of us came from.

253
00:17:36,87 --> 00:17:37,88
It's really really hard

254
00:17:37,88 --> 00:17:41,24
and then you often find with your partner
they they're quite happy to sort of live

255
00:17:41,24 --> 00:17:45,50
in a tent for four years whereas of us women
especially with babies you just don't

256
00:17:45,50 --> 00:17:50,27
want to keep doing that. So yeah i
think it created a lot of tension

257
00:17:50,28 --> 00:17:53,37
and relationships and just
the hard yakka the hard work

258
00:17:53,37 --> 00:17:58,61
and then there's the whole feminist the
whole sort of six sexist role battle

259
00:17:58,62 --> 00:17:59,94
that went on like all the men.

260
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,33
Now there with a chainsaw
and fixing the cars

261
00:18:02,33 --> 00:18:04,17
and the women looking after the babies

262
00:18:04,17 --> 00:18:07,85
and people feeling a bit sort of
stuck in their roles and you know

263
00:18:09,00 --> 00:18:12,79
that sort of thing i think
it created a lot of tension.

264
00:18:12,81 --> 00:18:18,10
Sort of born out of necessity. As role.

265
00:18:18,87 --> 00:18:24,45
About. I see males and
females as being different.

266
00:18:24,47 --> 00:18:26,88
And here are they not better not worse.

267
00:18:27,24 --> 00:18:29,46
I think some women love
might love fixing cars

268
00:18:29,46 --> 00:18:32,75
and using chainsaws other men
like looking after babies

269
00:18:32,75 --> 00:18:36,14
and cooking in the kitchen so.

270
00:18:37,25 --> 00:18:41,53
Lost that there is one but

271
00:18:42,69 --> 00:18:46,75
when there are advantages in living
in a community like this for you.

272
00:18:48,18 --> 00:18:53,24
There's a single using my. I have been
for the last three or four years.

273
00:18:53,83 --> 00:18:58,58
Oh look at fantastic living on a community
is always somebody look after you kids

274
00:18:58,58 --> 00:19:01,96
or you know you can always share
the whole parenting role.

275
00:19:02,50 --> 00:19:05,20
And for other kids you know
fishy when they get older.

276
00:19:05,24 --> 00:19:08,13
I've had a few coming in and they
need to talk about their problems

277
00:19:08,13 --> 00:19:11,21
and they can't talk about
it with their parents so.

278
00:19:11,23 --> 00:19:15,24
You know for the kids there's a lot more
adult interaction that they can get

279
00:19:15,24 --> 00:19:18,94
and they can get their needs met a lot
more from other adults rather than just

280
00:19:18,94 --> 00:19:24,13
their own parent. Give us. The way we can.

281
00:19:25,59 --> 00:19:28,41
Yeah well there are a lot
more most. You know.

282
00:19:28,59 --> 00:19:32,85
Yeah well most of the kids seem to be
really comfortable with other adults

283
00:19:32,85 --> 00:19:36,08
and they like and walk into a room
with adults and feel quite comfortable

284
00:19:36,08 --> 00:19:40,05
and so there they come to our parties
and they're not so shuffled away

285
00:19:41,08 --> 00:19:44,78
and they're very much part of the whole
lifestyle here they're integrated

286
00:19:44,78 --> 00:19:46,51
and i think that's really
really healthy i mean

287
00:19:46,51 --> 00:19:48,34
when i was a kid you
know any visitors came

288
00:19:48,34 --> 00:19:52,35
and your shovel out the back door
seen and not heard sort of thing

289
00:19:53,08 --> 00:19:56,59
and i think it gives them the kids here
a lot more life skills in terms of

290
00:19:56,59 --> 00:19:59,25
communicating and what
they want and they can.

291
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,90
There are a lot more compassionate about
people with problems i mean we've had

292
00:20:02,90 --> 00:20:03,90
quite a few people

293
00:20:03,90 --> 00:20:07,57
that nimbin gee you've had a few
problems sort of mental problems

294
00:20:07,57 --> 00:20:09,00
and the kids just observe it.

295
00:20:09,07 --> 00:20:12,49
And there are a lot more
equipped to deal with people

296
00:20:12,49 --> 00:20:17,54
when they're older than you know sort of
just had their own adult parents to relate

297
00:20:17,54 --> 00:20:26,39
to one of the downsides things you.

298
00:20:26,41 --> 00:20:31,16
The downside the kids here.

299
00:20:31,17 --> 00:20:36,16
I think the media they often watch you
know happy families on the telly like the

300
00:20:36,16 --> 00:20:38,95
cosby show and all that and
there they are there videos

301
00:20:38,95 --> 00:20:42,41
and there you know all there is and they
come back and they've got brown rice

302
00:20:42,41 --> 00:20:47,71
and candle light and. And i often
think that you know a few years ago.

303
00:20:47,83 --> 00:20:49,58
We're all worried that all our
kids were going to go off

304
00:20:49,58 --> 00:20:52,85
and want to be yapper eastern policemen
and lawyers and things like that.

305
00:20:55,36 --> 00:20:57,97
So you know with the
external world stepping

306
00:20:57,97 --> 00:21:03,58
and i think in a lot of our kids minds
that creates they're not so happy.

307
00:21:03,80 --> 00:21:06,00
I'd rather have what they see on the telly

308
00:21:07,71 --> 00:21:13,51
but as they get older i think they realize
what that what they've gained here and.

309
00:21:13,53 --> 00:21:19,15
You know it's not such a big
gap that they see the change

310
00:21:20,12 --> 00:21:27,01
and come up one way to
get yeah yeah well at

311
00:21:27,01 --> 00:21:28,84
the moment this is one of my things.

312
00:21:28,93 --> 00:21:36,85
There's not a lot for the kids to
get into there's no not much work.

313
00:21:37,80 --> 00:21:41,63
It's you know it's a real petting the nimbin
high school put in a submission to go

314
00:21:41,63 --> 00:21:42,55
on to 11 12

315
00:21:42,55 --> 00:21:46,74
and it was knocked back for the life of
me i cannot understand why there are so

316
00:21:46,74 --> 00:21:48,72
many kids coming up to that age.

317
00:21:48,96 --> 00:21:52,25
They've all got to jump in the bus
and go on to lose more and back them

318
00:21:52,25 --> 00:21:55,99
and school is going to offer a lot of
diversity in terms of the schooling hours

319
00:21:55,99 --> 00:21:59,47
they could pick and choose when they
came and went a lot of interesting.

320
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:02,64
You know like the wood work and
metal work and the it's all

321
00:22:02,64 --> 00:22:05,66
that sort of thing was going to be very
strong personal development subjects were

322
00:22:05,66 --> 00:22:08,67
going to be strong as
well as a chess see and

323
00:22:08,68 --> 00:22:12,03
that was a real blow to me to a lot of kids
a lot of kids are going to leave school

324
00:22:12,86 --> 00:22:14,65
two years before they really should

325
00:22:14,65 --> 00:22:19,55
or cause you know 15 16 year not very
mature to cope with what they are out there

326
00:22:20,49 --> 00:22:23,93
rather than when you say 17 after
you've been through the system.

327
00:22:25,14 --> 00:22:28,60
So that's a real pity but i just see
for a lot of the kids that they have

328
00:22:29,90 --> 00:22:36,24
and it's slowly happening but we need
to provide more work experience more.

329
00:22:36,25 --> 00:22:38,76
For them to tap into when they get older.

330
00:22:38,79 --> 00:22:40,88
Those you know rather than
having to go to the city

331
00:22:40,88 --> 00:22:43,39
or just to sit around on the
dole and they finish school.

332
00:22:43,86 --> 00:22:45,43
That's very important here now

333
00:22:45,43 --> 00:22:47,90
and the so i mean i don't
know what the statistics are

334
00:22:47,90 --> 00:22:53,24
but the so many kids now coming of age
from you know the 70s that's what 18 years

335
00:22:53,24 --> 00:22:57,32
ago. We've got to leave a 10 year old kids
that were born from the aquarius time

336
00:22:57,32 --> 00:23:02,12
and they all really need
something to to key and to.

337
00:23:02,14 --> 00:23:04,66
So that's that's a real
challenge from them then.

338
00:23:04,71 --> 00:23:04,86
And

339
00:23:04,86 --> 00:23:11,78
that me is a real high priority.
