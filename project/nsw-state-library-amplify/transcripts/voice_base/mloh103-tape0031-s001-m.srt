1
00:00:13,91 --> 00:00:17,37
I think the main reason. In retrospect
the main reason for leaving the city

2
00:00:17,37 --> 00:00:19,99
and coming coming to nimbin

3
00:00:19,99 --> 00:00:24,21
and balance in such places was was
really to live our own lives.

4
00:00:24,42 --> 00:00:27,00
I think that's that's the
fundamental part of it

5
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:33,73
that the it became it was becoming
increasingly in strongly obvious living in the

6
00:00:33,73 --> 00:00:34,75
city living the lives

7
00:00:34,75 --> 00:00:40,47
that our parents generation set up which
included sending us trying to send us to

8
00:00:41,18 --> 00:00:45,06
fight a war in vietnam that we
fundamentally didn't believe in and

9
00:00:45,07 --> 00:00:51,86
and becoming more and more involved in a
society totally dependent on oil and.

10
00:00:51,88 --> 00:00:57,68
Resources which couldn't be sustained
at the level that we were using them.

11
00:00:57,70 --> 00:01:01,69
And while they were particular
things wrong with that

12
00:01:02,71 --> 00:01:04,71
that way of living.

13
00:01:04,73 --> 00:01:07,87
I think now that the
most important thing was

14
00:01:07,87 --> 00:01:11,63
that we wanted to have a life of our
own and i i really strongly think

15
00:01:11,63 --> 00:01:13,25
that every generation should do that.

16
00:01:14,68 --> 00:01:15,77
So that when we came up here

17
00:01:15,77 --> 00:01:19,35
and we tried new forms of
relationship a new forms of family

18
00:01:19,35 --> 00:01:24,80
and new patterns of responsibility for
children in new ways of living community

19
00:01:24,80 --> 00:01:29,67
and new forms of property ownership
community property ownership

20
00:01:29,67 --> 00:01:32,21
and so on.

21
00:01:32,22 --> 00:01:37,22
Some of those of just become part of the
mainstream some of them have been dropped

22
00:01:37,22 --> 00:01:38,10
altogether.

23
00:01:38,11 --> 00:01:43,75
Now many of us like to have private
property allow there are still some very

24
00:01:43,75 --> 00:01:47,86
successful community properties
around and these are increasing.

25
00:01:47,87 --> 00:01:52,00
But now they tend to be what are called
multiple occupancies where it's almost a

26
00:01:52,00 --> 00:01:56,51
strata titled system where everyone has
their small block of land with their house

27
00:01:56,51 --> 00:02:01,06
on it and this community ownership
of 100 acres or so. I've of forest.

28
00:02:01,52 --> 00:02:04,98
In the middle. So it's a it's a
nice combination i think of both

29
00:02:04,98 --> 00:02:09,92
and it's worthwhile to find out what are
the things which which people really need

30
00:02:09,92 --> 00:02:12,85
how much private property. How much.

31
00:02:12,87 --> 00:02:19,00
Exclusivity of relationships and
continuity relationships that people need.

32
00:02:19,04 --> 00:02:19,82
I think

33
00:02:19,82 --> 00:02:23,64
when we came from the city we we came out
of a system which was far too repressive

34
00:02:24,81 --> 00:02:29,20
and as in all revolutionary movements
we went to the opposite extreme.

35
00:02:29,22 --> 00:02:33,05
And now we're those of us in that
generation and probably coming back

36
00:02:33,05 --> 00:02:36,71
and finding some some middle
ground which suits us.

37
00:02:36,73 --> 00:02:39,89
Hopefully the next generation will
take off from our middle ground and

38
00:02:39,89 --> 00:02:44,64
and find a ground that
suits them. So that.

39
00:02:45,27 --> 00:02:48,58
The fact that now we don't all
live community and we don't all.

40
00:02:49,26 --> 00:02:51,67
Continue to share each other's.

41
00:02:51,68 --> 00:02:52,94
Partners and

42
00:02:52,94 --> 00:02:56,43
that some of us there in monogamous
relationships i don't think is in any sense of

43
00:02:56,43 --> 00:02:59,44
failure it was it was
worth while testing it

44
00:02:59,44 --> 00:03:01,70
and changing it to whatever
extent we needed to

45
00:03:02,77 --> 00:03:10,62
and finding out for ourselves
what what worked for us.

46
00:03:12,41 --> 00:03:13,66
That's a good thing to find out.

47
00:03:13,76 --> 00:03:28,17
That's a much better thing to find out
than to have simply passed on to you.

48
00:03:28,18 --> 00:03:32,88
Fondest memories of him and would have to
be the healing festivals in the music.

49
00:03:34,09 --> 00:03:35,49
Just the.

50
00:03:35,50 --> 00:03:39,74
Probably my very fondest memory
is being shared poohed by three

51
00:03:39,74 --> 00:03:42,55
or four people.

52
00:03:42,57 --> 00:03:46,30
I massaged by six or
eight people all singing

53
00:03:46,30 --> 00:03:53,18
and chanting delightfully no
no heavy single personal vibes

54
00:03:53,18 --> 00:03:59,85
just just bodily being part of a group
of people in that way. The color.

55
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,16
The colour of people's dress
costume you might call that

56
00:04:04,13 --> 00:04:08,57
and just a continual music that was
made by us and really the notion

57
00:04:08,57 --> 00:04:11,91
that we were doing all this we were
having this marvelous magic creative

58
00:04:11,91 --> 00:04:16,26
interesting energetic lifestyle and
it was only we who were doing it

59
00:04:17,02 --> 00:04:19,04
and i think that's the real.

60
00:04:20,22 --> 00:04:23,78
That really came from the concept
the original concept of aquarius

61
00:04:24,48 --> 00:04:26,39
that graeme dance and
johnny allen set up is

62
00:04:26,39 --> 00:04:32,86
that the festival was to be just to come
from the energy and what people did there.

63
00:04:32,93 --> 00:04:35,29
It wasn't as festivals are now.

64
00:04:35,73 --> 00:04:41,61
Or even woodstock was paid bands coming
from somewhere else to entertain a group of

65
00:04:41,61 --> 00:04:45,58
consuming masses because that's the
lifestyle we want to leave in the city.

66
00:04:45,66 --> 00:04:49,11
It's boring to be in the audience
and consumer all the time

67
00:04:49,11 --> 00:04:54,09
and it's wonderful to to have adventures
and to do it yourself when you can.

68
00:04:54,85 --> 00:04:58,24
I've seen. I've had probably
the best experiences

69
00:04:58,24 --> 00:05:02,62
and had the best music in my life in.

70
00:05:02,64 --> 00:05:06,72
And of course a good
circle gets going where

71
00:05:06,72 --> 00:05:10,46
that sort of energy attracts
people who have studied many years

72
00:05:10,46 --> 00:05:15,65
and have developed their real skills
in music and art and drama and so on.

73
00:05:15,88 --> 00:05:19,34
And those people would. Would come
to an im and we would see also

74
00:05:19,34 --> 00:05:23,57
that there is real value in in
really skilled musicians but

75
00:05:23,57 --> 00:05:25,82
but there's also wonderful fun in.

76
00:05:26,32 --> 00:05:31,80
You know homegrown musicians and eventually
the two the difference disappears.

77
00:05:32,52 --> 00:05:38,40
The whole idea was to build a a
life style in a place where.

78
00:05:39,12 --> 00:05:41,39
They are say the best people would
would want to come and live

79
00:05:42,33 --> 00:05:52,56
and they did.

80
00:05:55,05 --> 00:06:00,16
This. I think in the early
days of nimbin. It was.

81
00:06:01,76 --> 00:06:04,71
You know to be a bit brave
and a bit self-sufficient

82
00:06:04,71 --> 00:06:09,91
and have a bit of background
to leave. To leave the city.

83
00:06:10,56 --> 00:06:16,29
There was nothing here. So it
wasn't easy. In any sense.

84
00:06:17,72 --> 00:06:21,41
I imagine a few people came to
the aquarius festival and could.

85
00:06:21,93 --> 00:06:25,97
Without doing anything themselves kind of.

86
00:06:25,99 --> 00:06:29,09
You know the offtake from
take from the others

87
00:06:29,09 --> 00:06:32,57
but actually moving up here there was
there was nothing we had to make our own

88
00:06:32,57 --> 00:06:36,05
relationships our own fun our own
music and and that was great

89
00:06:36,05 --> 00:06:41,83
but i think only people with a with a
certain energy and enthusiasm can do that.

90
00:06:43,78 --> 00:06:45,79
I don't know about the
concept of madness at

91
00:06:45,79 --> 00:06:51,52
that time i was very much part of the
anti-psychiatry movement taking my fourth

92
00:06:51,52 --> 00:06:53,53
year honours psychology students to the.

93
00:06:54,02 --> 00:07:00,59
The psych hospitals and showing how they
were diagnosed and brutalized and that

94
00:07:00,60 --> 00:07:07,46
that how that wasn't necessary wasn't
as necessary as as what was happening.

95
00:07:08,28 --> 00:07:08,41
And.

96
00:07:08,97 --> 00:07:12,90
So i don't know whether we were mad i'm not
sure whether we were people who couldn't

97
00:07:12,90 --> 00:07:16,54
cope in the city and came to a
place where we made a lifestyle

98
00:07:16,54 --> 00:07:19,37
that we could cope with or whether
we were just creative and energetic

99
00:07:19,37 --> 00:07:25,25
and wonderful and amazing. And the truth
is probably a bit of both as it is we.

100
00:07:25,25 --> 00:07:26,98
I suppose we've migrants in any situation.

101
00:07:27,48 --> 00:07:31,80
I guess migrants are the best in the worst
of of any country the most creative

102
00:07:31,80 --> 00:07:37,19
but also the most dissatisfied the
strongest but also the least.

103
00:07:37,20 --> 00:07:42,68
Well adjusted i don't know about all that.

104
00:07:42,70 --> 00:07:44,99
To a certain extent i think that

105
00:07:44,99 --> 00:07:48,69
that real difficulties including
possibly madness and so

106
00:07:48,69 --> 00:07:52,65
and to some extent could be
could be coped with an absorbed

107
00:07:52,65 --> 00:07:56,10
and used an integrated.

108
00:07:56,11 --> 00:07:59,95
In the sort of life they were leading
because it was it was trial.

109
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,03
Well but it wasn't organized it was there
that you could your energy was welcome

110
00:08:05,03 --> 00:08:08,39
but it wasn't on demand from
one to five and i think

111
00:08:08,39 --> 00:08:15,07
that sort of continuity of of the
presence of other people without the

112
00:08:15,07 --> 00:08:21,17
without. Divided demands
and structures and.

113
00:08:22,46 --> 00:08:24,75
Regular demands of people.

114
00:08:25,57 --> 00:08:29,67
Allows a lot more people to to adjust
and be energetic and give of their best

115
00:08:29,67 --> 00:08:31,08
and then a very ordered.

116
00:08:31,58 --> 00:08:43,78
Social system does.

117
00:08:44,71 --> 00:08:50,66
I think too in those in those early days
we we were fascinated by the differences

118
00:08:52,17 --> 00:08:55,73
between people between
us we all was very much.

119
00:08:55,77 --> 00:08:58,46
The thought that we all
had something to offer.

120
00:08:58,48 --> 00:09:03,84
And if it was really really weird
or far out that was a good thing.

121
00:09:03,98 --> 00:09:06,83
Certainly wasn't threatening.

122
00:09:07,57 --> 00:09:12,46
You know a real freak was someone who was
who was valued in an interesting rather

123
00:09:12,46 --> 00:09:18,48
than someone who had problems always
diagnosable or who couldn't quite make it

124
00:09:18,48 --> 00:09:19,73
or adjust or control

125
00:09:19,73 --> 00:09:33,68
and skills.

126
00:09:33,70 --> 00:09:36,57
And i remember sleeping one
night in a dome made of.

127
00:09:38,77 --> 00:09:40,99
Probably mud bricks and concrete.

128
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:45,78
That was completely studded with
bottles of different colors so that

129
00:09:45,78 --> 00:09:47,15
when you lay down on the ground.

130
00:09:47,16 --> 00:09:50,77
You looked out along the length of
a bottle to the to the moonlight

131
00:09:50,77 --> 00:09:54,32
and the whole thing was
with a multicolored.

132
00:09:54,80 --> 00:09:59,73
Sort of psychedelic heaven
dome over the top of you.

133
00:10:01,64 --> 00:10:07,64
And somebody lived in that i mean.
How could you judge a bit of.

134
00:10:08,21 --> 00:10:11,49
How could you judge whether that
person was mad. I just amazing.

135
00:10:12,59 --> 00:10:16,41
And i think there was a lot in the eastern
spiritual tradition which which had a

136
00:10:16,41 --> 00:10:20,95
lot of trouble distinguishing
between madness and.

137
00:10:20,97 --> 00:10:23,47
Spiritual.

138
00:10:23,49 --> 00:10:28,45
And spiritual craziness.

139
00:10:28,47 --> 00:10:32,92
And my friend harry freeman the psychiatrist
in our sesay has a lot of trouble to

140
00:10:32,92 --> 00:10:36,98
sing sing to in a spiritual transformation
and an episode of madness in

141
00:10:38,36 --> 00:10:52,60
and wouldn't be too keen
to tell which was which.

142
00:10:54,65 --> 00:10:57,52
Harry gumboots valley an
amazing person in my memory.

143
00:10:57,70 --> 00:11:02,43
Harry gumboot was out a tangible falls
where we all used to eat community in the

144
00:11:02,43 --> 00:11:06,45
early days at the white house every month
or so the christians would come around

145
00:11:06,45 --> 00:11:11,68
and feed us and play music and we'd chant
and sing their songs it was wonderful

146
00:11:11,68 --> 00:11:15,79
but then we had to listen to their to their
10 minute speech about how the world

147
00:11:15,79 --> 00:11:19,71
was created two hundred sixty seven
years ago and even we couldn't take

148
00:11:19,71 --> 00:11:20,51
that sort of thing.

149
00:11:21,59 --> 00:11:24,76
So the next time they came we made
up a song called harry gumboot.

150
00:11:25,31 --> 00:11:27,72
And instead of harry rah
always saying harry gumboot.

151
00:11:29,12 --> 00:11:32,67
And there was actually a person called
harry gumboot on top of at the time so it

152
00:11:32,67 --> 00:11:38,67
was it was our way of the being spiritual
in joining with anything without being.

153
00:11:38,69 --> 00:11:43,30
Without being silly about it. Losing
a sense of fun and perspective.

154
00:11:43,96 --> 00:11:45,82
I mean even hippies can't believe

155
00:11:45,82 --> 00:11:55,36
that they were was created two
hundred sixty seven years ago.

156
00:11:56,29 --> 00:11:58,63
Once when i was living at explained farm.

157
00:12:02,21 --> 00:12:06,83
A few of us had been to have been to
thailand to do meditation retreats and.

158
00:12:07,46 --> 00:12:10,53
A couple of the people bought
a time monk back with them.

159
00:12:11,63 --> 00:12:15,40
Very much an iteration of us setting
up our own lifestyle and communities

160
00:12:15,40 --> 00:12:19,21
and so on and i guess instead of
building a church we bought a time monk

161
00:12:19,21 --> 00:12:22,44
and build him a little dome up in the.

162
00:12:22,46 --> 00:12:26,20
Up and one of the shelves of land
high above the the plan farm.

163
00:12:26,87 --> 00:12:33,43
One of us at a time would be his his
keeper to look after him and every morning

164
00:12:33,43 --> 00:12:40,60
and afternoon there would be a meditation
sitting around 10 a channel time monk.

165
00:12:40,62 --> 00:12:43,28
So that that that's how
we provided for our.

166
00:12:45,15 --> 00:12:48,08
That was our church i suppose
for our little community for.

167
00:12:49,73 --> 00:12:54,20
For those few years that it
lasted and tonnage and went down.

168
00:12:54,22 --> 00:13:00,97
After that to stay in what in sydney. At.

169
00:13:00,99 --> 00:13:04,64
Once when i asked on a chain what the
secret of life was he said drink coffee

170
00:13:04,64 --> 00:13:11,29
and sleep that is a secret of
life drink coffee and sleep.

171
00:13:12,71 --> 00:13:16,06
So if you want to have your own resident
time monkey discover and get one.

172
00:13:16,75 --> 00:13:19,62
You'll find someone who you always
find some part of the world

173
00:13:19,62 --> 00:13:21,99
that will cooperate with any scheme
that's got enough imagination

174
00:13:23,49 --> 00:13:34,39
and there's got good energy to it.

175
00:13:34,41 --> 00:13:40,71
There were very few people in them and who
set themselves up as gurus. Although.

176
00:13:40,73 --> 00:13:45,35
There are a couple of
exceptions to that statement.

177
00:13:46,12 --> 00:13:52,63
The world is full of gurus and it was
wonderful to be able to to adopt gurus

178
00:13:52,63 --> 00:13:58,70
or ideas from eastern religions and practices
and and build them into one's life

179
00:13:58,70 --> 00:13:59,93
and then then bill.

180
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,37
No just like being able to read
the literature of the the world.

181
00:14:06,39 --> 00:14:13,08
They're just ideas they're just.
Ways that some people have found to.

182
00:14:14,09 --> 00:14:18,85
Broaden and deepen their spiritual and
magic aspects of their lives. I suppose.

183
00:14:19,71 --> 00:14:23,45
We had a good. We always had a good
level of skepticism about things.

184
00:14:25,73 --> 00:14:26,77
They hurry questions of fun

185
00:14:26,77 --> 00:14:33,14
but they always thought i was as being
pretty strange really had been the world got

186
00:14:33,14 --> 00:14:35,76
plenty of room for strange
people and the world

187
00:14:35,76 --> 00:14:39,59
that we left in the city didn't have room
to strange people and it was its loss

188
00:14:39,59 --> 00:14:45,97
that it didn't. It was in the
diagnosing and excluding and and.

189
00:14:46,50 --> 00:14:53,33
One of the the original gurus i suppose
in the city was marshall mcluhan.

190
00:14:53,35 --> 00:14:55,83
And then at a more intellectual level.

191
00:14:56,06 --> 00:15:00,43
Herbert marcuse who wrote a book
called one dimensional man and

192
00:15:00,44 --> 00:15:05,65
that was probably captured what we what we
didn't like about what life was like in

193
00:15:05,65 --> 00:15:11,78
the city. It was one dimensional you
fitted in. A narrow you didn't have ideas.

194
00:15:11,90 --> 00:15:14,24
We never talked about one
didn't talk about politics

195
00:15:14,24 --> 00:15:19,89
or religion certainly didn't talk about
magical sexuality or drugs or fun

196
00:15:19,89 --> 00:15:23,39
or adventure that was all what
they did in the 17th century

197
00:15:23,39 --> 00:15:24,98
when there was a world to explore

198
00:15:25,85 --> 00:15:29,62
and suddenly with the help of some
psychedelics we we found there was an inner

199
00:15:29,62 --> 00:15:31,99
world to explore and it was
really nothing to stop us.

200
00:15:31,99 --> 00:15:39,15
I suppose.

201
00:15:39,17 --> 00:15:44,69
I think i think the presence of psychedelics
a bit of a list that was around and

202
00:15:45,60 --> 00:15:49,71
and some of the good dope was i
think it was probably fundamental

203
00:15:49,71 --> 00:15:55,63
and basic to two. To the
whole new age thing.

204
00:15:55,78 --> 00:15:59,58
Really i think it probably
was. I think it just.

205
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,50
Let you see that there was another.

206
00:16:02,52 --> 00:16:06,44
Whole dimension of possibilities
about human life.

207
00:16:06,87 --> 00:16:11,50
And then of course you could
read eastern literature and.

208
00:16:11,52 --> 00:16:17,69
And some of the some of the more
spiritual western literature and know

209
00:16:17,69 --> 00:16:22,90
that people had lived the experience of
those dimensions of life in the past

210
00:16:22,90 --> 00:16:24,05
and why weren't we doing it.

211
00:16:24,06 --> 00:16:28,12
That's our birthright that's part of what
we're capable of as human beings and

212
00:16:28,87 --> 00:16:31,51
and we wanted to be able to do it.

213
00:16:31,53 --> 00:16:35,97
And it probably just looked a lot
easier to do it out in the countryside.

214
00:16:35,99 --> 00:16:38,72
Amongst ourselves.

215
00:16:39,89 --> 00:16:44,36
Consenting to do so rather than to have
to fight to do it in a city where it was

216
00:16:44,36 --> 00:16:46,13
thought of with.

217
00:16:46,95 --> 00:16:49,30
With this belief and fear

218
00:16:49,30 --> 00:16:59,51
and so on.

219
00:16:59,52 --> 00:17:03,63
You get very much a sense of place of nimbin
in virtually anyone who spent any time

220
00:17:03,63 --> 00:17:05,09
here ends up coming back.

221
00:17:06,01 --> 00:17:08,64
Whether to stay if they can or
whether they just keep coming back.

222
00:17:08,88 --> 00:17:12,67
There's something very magic about the
fact that this is in the mountains.

223
00:17:13,71 --> 00:17:19,80
There's a lot of days when it's misty
rainy quite quite hobbit like.

224
00:17:21,12 --> 00:17:21,63
That was probably

225
00:17:21,63 --> 00:17:27,20
and one of the one of the very important
bits of western literature that

226
00:17:27,20 --> 00:17:33,44
that informed our whole way of life was
tolkien's books had to read talkings books

227
00:17:33,44 --> 00:17:36,30
and then you'd be just about
prepared to leave the city in come

228
00:17:36,30 --> 00:17:41,51
and live in in this lovely hobbit country
where of the misty mountains where you

229
00:17:41,51 --> 00:17:45,82
can live around the mountain from somebody
else they only 10 minutes walk away

230
00:17:45,82 --> 00:17:48,12
or five minutes walk away.

231
00:17:48,14 --> 00:17:50,73
And yet hardly see them and to know

232
00:17:50,73 --> 00:17:54,81
that there's a lot of really really magic
unexplored nature between you and them.

233
00:17:56,00 --> 00:17:59,51
And it kind of all falls for
example a big commune here.

234
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,49
The whole place is joined by walking tracks
which go across numerous creeks and.

235
00:18:06,33 --> 00:18:10,85
Walking barefoot around tracks in the
rainforest to see. Your neighbors.

236
00:18:11,32 --> 00:18:15,78
In the misty days are in the evenings
with glow worms on the way and.

237
00:18:15,80 --> 00:18:21,28
Animals in the trees it's just a life
it's so full and rich of nature and magic

238
00:18:21,28 --> 00:18:23,59
and spirituality and.

239
00:18:23,60 --> 00:18:26,61
That's very different from living
in a fibro house in bankstown.

240
00:18:28,30 --> 00:18:33,81
And going to sydney university
too and. Something or other.

241
00:18:33,83 --> 00:18:37,86
Or teaching it.

242
00:18:39,16 --> 00:18:44,33
Ok.

243
00:18:44,35 --> 00:18:48,19
To.

244
00:18:48,20 --> 00:18:51,80
Pimp enough.

245
00:18:51,82 --> 00:18:59,30
There.

246
00:19:00,25 --> 00:19:04,86
I am in a. So.

247
00:19:05,67 --> 00:19:10,70
My name's diana roberts currently an
alderman on little city council which i have

248
00:19:10,70 --> 00:19:12,59
been for the last 15 months or so

249
00:19:13,63 --> 00:19:18,65
and i'm a herbalist i own my own business
in limon which i share with a friend

250
00:19:19,49 --> 00:19:21,56
and i've been practicing in
them and as a herbalist on

251
00:19:21,56 --> 00:19:24,04
and off since i moved
here eight years ago.

252
00:19:25,02 --> 00:19:31,37
I live on a community about 12
kilometres from limon with nine other

253
00:19:32,15 --> 00:19:32,77
households.

254
00:19:33,74 --> 00:19:37,37
We have 16 children 15 adults
so we're quite a big community

255
00:19:39,36 --> 00:19:46,85
and i have a five year old daughter.

256
00:19:48,16 --> 00:19:51,51
About 13 years ago when
i was living in sydney.

257
00:19:51,70 --> 00:19:56,59
My partner and i decided that we would
really like to live to move to the bush.

258
00:19:56,66 --> 00:19:59,37
We both came from a rural area and i use.

259
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,00
And we lived in sydney for 10 years
and didn't really want to be part of

260
00:20:06,00 --> 00:20:09,07
that sort of environment anymore
not because we didn't like it

261
00:20:09,07 --> 00:20:11,59
but because we wanted to change
and wanted something else

262
00:20:12,50 --> 00:20:16,25
and we got together a group of
people there were six of us

263
00:20:16,97 --> 00:20:22,29
and we spent about six months looking for
land in rural areas along the coast north

264
00:20:22,29 --> 00:20:26,79
of sydney and the further we got from
sydney the cheaper the land became

265
00:20:26,79 --> 00:20:30,98
and we eventually found this
piece of land near nim and

266
00:20:30,98 --> 00:20:34,52
that was a piece of land
that we could afford and

267
00:20:34,52 --> 00:20:38,45
that we were also able to develop
as a multiple occupancy so

268
00:20:38,46 --> 00:20:45,45
that was just over 10 years ago
and here we are. Components.

269
00:20:45,70 --> 00:20:51,44
It's a hundred acres that used to be
it probably once was dairying country

270
00:20:51,44 --> 00:20:53,84
and then as the land became more

271
00:20:53,84 --> 00:20:59,51
and more degraded it was basically disgracing
country but it was a very sort of.

272
00:20:59,52 --> 00:21:02,34
Low grade. You know low
quality piece of land

273
00:21:02,34 --> 00:21:06,45
when we moved here we've got eight

274
00:21:06,46 --> 00:21:08,92
or nine families now living here

275
00:21:10,00 --> 00:21:15,68
and we've all built our own houses are in
the process of building our own houses.

276
00:21:16,79 --> 00:21:21,47
We are not a sort of a tight community
in that we don't sort of eat together

277
00:21:22,27 --> 00:21:23,76
and spend a lot of our time together.

278
00:21:24,06 --> 00:21:27,81
However we're a very sort of
closely knit community and

279
00:21:27,81 --> 00:21:31,62
that we socialize together a lot. We
play volleyball together once a week.

280
00:21:31,79 --> 00:21:33,75
It's a very supportive community

281
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:40,72
and we're all good friends i'd have to say
it's taken quite a long time to get to

282
00:21:40,72 --> 00:21:43,73
that point we've seen people
who've come and gone.

283
00:21:44,05 --> 00:21:45,85
Especially in the first five years

284
00:21:45,85 --> 00:21:52,34
that sort of a real initiation time
for people who move on to multiple

285
00:21:52,34 --> 00:21:53,20
occupancies in

286
00:21:53,20 --> 00:21:57,19
that you know you have to learn to live
with a group of people you don't have

287
00:21:57,19 --> 00:21:59,85
anything to live in. So you're
also building your houses.

288
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,89
It's a very stressful time generally for
relationships because you suddenly spent

289
00:22:05,89 --> 00:22:09,72
spending a lot of time with your partner
which you might never have done before.

290
00:22:10,57 --> 00:22:13,42
So it's almost like you getting to know
your partner you're getting to know your

291
00:22:13,42 --> 00:22:15,38
family and you're getting to
know this group of people

292
00:22:15,38 --> 00:22:16,40
that you've never met before

293
00:22:17,67 --> 00:22:22,72
and you're living in you know pretty primitive
conditions in the early days i mean

294
00:22:22,72 --> 00:22:28,43
i lived under just a piece of tin
about two meters by three meters.

295
00:22:28,46 --> 00:22:33,65
I slept in a tent with go and
as and snakes and you name it.

296
00:22:33,77 --> 00:22:37,90
Jumping ants and all sorts of
interesting little creatures.

297
00:22:38,96 --> 00:22:43,66
I endured about six months
of almost continual rain

298
00:22:43,66 --> 00:22:48,44
when i first moved here which was the
most frustrating experience for somebody

299
00:22:48,44 --> 00:22:52,17
trying to build a house and get
a decent roof over our head

300
00:22:53,87 --> 00:22:58,88
and i also found myself in a situation
of building my own house when.

301
00:22:59,35 --> 00:23:00,85
Prior to moving here

302
00:23:00,85 --> 00:23:05,01
and i reckon i could count on one hand the
number of times i've picked up a hammer

303
00:23:05,01 --> 00:23:06,96
probably never used a drill in my life

304
00:23:07,99 --> 00:23:10,93
and i've never ever seen
a four inch nail before

305
00:23:10,93 --> 00:23:16,91
and i know all those things
intimately now and i truly have.

306
00:23:17,23 --> 00:23:19,33
You know a house to live in

307
00:23:19,33 --> 00:23:22,88
that a lot of which i've built
myself i'm quite proud of it.

308
00:23:24,44 --> 00:23:28,18
I think for the people who've
lived here in that thousands

309
00:23:28,18 --> 00:23:29,81
that have different ways
to build their houses

310
00:23:30,82 --> 00:23:34,95
and we have some stone houses where we've
sort of quarried you know made small

311
00:23:34,95 --> 00:23:37,50
quarries in some in some of our hills

312
00:23:39,60 --> 00:23:42,45
but generally we're all pretty comfortable

313
00:23:42,45 --> 00:23:46,76
and i think you know happy with the
lifestyle i mean it's it's a very sort of

314
00:23:47,79 --> 00:23:48,26
pleasant.

315
00:23:48,30 --> 00:23:59,25
Although very sort of challenging
in confronting way to live.

316
00:24:00,90 --> 00:24:03,16
We had a lot of struggles
in the early days

317
00:24:03,16 --> 00:24:09,75
when we came here we had struggles with
our neighbors who were very resistant to

318
00:24:09,75 --> 00:24:16,44
the idea of having a multiple occupancy
next door and we went through.

319
00:24:16,46 --> 00:24:21,44
Fairly unpleasant processes of taking
neighbors to court and till we realized

320
00:24:21,44 --> 00:24:24,72
that really you know that sort of
the legal way wasn't the way to go

321
00:24:25,87 --> 00:24:31,44
and it was you know much better to try
and negotiate solutions with neighbors

322
00:24:31,44 --> 00:24:36,56
or really just to sort of let them be and
let time sort of heal those divisions.

323
00:24:38,55 --> 00:24:40,10
We also had difficult times.

324
00:24:40,24 --> 00:24:42,88
You know between ourselves
just learning to live together

325
00:24:42,88 --> 00:24:48,82
and then we also had very difficult
times with council we put in a

326
00:24:48,82 --> 00:24:53,87
development at vacation after we bought
the land which was fairly common practice

327
00:24:53,87 --> 00:24:54,46
in those days

328
00:24:55,50 --> 00:25:00,27
and still is you know to say in some ways
i mean you get a few developers who put

329
00:25:00,27 --> 00:25:03,56
in the development up a case and
before they actually find the people

330
00:25:04,46 --> 00:25:07,77
but for many people setting up a community
here they'll find the people find a

331
00:25:07,77 --> 00:25:11,24
piece of land and then they put in the
development application to council

332
00:25:12,22 --> 00:25:16,04
and in those days i think we would have put
ours in about eight years ago it was a

333
00:25:16,04 --> 00:25:21,37
very unfriendly council and
unfriendly council staff

334
00:25:21,37 --> 00:25:26,66
and we had an incredible struggle trying
to negotiate what we felt were reasonable

335
00:25:26,66 --> 00:25:31,43
conditions under which our
development could be approved

336
00:25:32,17 --> 00:25:35,58
and it took us quite a few years and
it cost us quite a lot of money

337
00:25:36,32 --> 00:25:42,03
and once again you know the only options
to us in the end were to follow the legal

338
00:25:42,03 --> 00:25:47,29
process and to take counsel to court
and we actually decided not to do

339
00:25:47,29 --> 00:25:50,79
that ultimately because that you know
it becomes a very different scenario.

340
00:25:51,20 --> 00:25:55,72
Once you're in court and the actual reality
gets lost in you know in the legal

341
00:25:55,72 --> 00:25:57,64
or sort of jargon them practice.

342
00:26:04,28 --> 00:26:15,55
No.

343
00:26:20,07 --> 00:26:20,24
Here.

344
00:26:21,62 --> 00:26:25,65
I think there's more councils a much more
friendly council now as far as multiple

345
00:26:25,65 --> 00:26:30,39
occupancy goes although there's still a
lot of prejudice amongst some of the

346
00:26:30,39 --> 00:26:31,43
or the man and staff

347
00:26:31,43 --> 00:26:35,73
and i think actually a lot of ignorance
about multiple occupancy last style

348
00:26:35,73 --> 00:26:39,83
and what it actually means is this vision
of a whole lot of hippies living in

349
00:26:39,83 --> 00:26:42,46
substandard conditions in the hills.

350
00:26:42,68 --> 00:26:44,97
Whereas in fact you know
it's not like that at all.

351
00:26:45,12 --> 00:26:50,39
And i've often thought it would be really
valuable to take you know people on tours

352
00:26:50,39 --> 00:26:53,64
of multiple occupancy so they can
actually see how people live.

353
00:26:55,01 --> 00:26:57,45
You know what the values
are of those people.

354
00:26:57,66 --> 00:27:00,90
I mean the values of those people are no
different to people in the wider community.

355
00:27:01,49 --> 00:27:06,53
It's just there's this perception
that you know that we are different.

356
00:27:07,70 --> 00:27:12,64
I think on other councils though perhaps
you know the situation isn't as friendly

357
00:27:12,64 --> 00:27:14,54
towards multiple occupancies

358
00:27:14,54 --> 00:27:17,91
or as easy i'm not saying it's friendly
in lismore council but it's easier

359
00:27:18,83 --> 00:27:22,91
and we saw a situation in chi oval
council about three years ago where they

360
00:27:22,91 --> 00:27:24,91
actually demolish somebodies house.

361
00:27:26,09 --> 00:27:29,37
This was a bamboo house it
was a really beautiful house

362
00:27:29,37 --> 00:27:32,67
that had been built by a
local bamboo house builder

363
00:27:32,67 --> 00:27:36,57
and was owned by a woman who
had three young children

364
00:27:37,97 --> 00:27:41,44
and i think the perception
on cuyahoga council was

365
00:27:41,44 --> 00:27:44,51
that here we had a woman
living in an illegal house

366
00:27:44,51 --> 00:27:46,38
that was meant to be a temporary dwelling.

367
00:27:46,52 --> 00:27:52,91
But an illegal house in substandard sort
of third world conditions because she had

368
00:27:52,91 --> 00:27:58,63
a rammed earth floor and she had a
pit toilet which many of us had and

369
00:27:58,64 --> 00:27:59,85
that it was a bamboo how.

370
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,99
It's like you see in asia and that created
all sorts of sort of shock horror

371
00:28:03,99 --> 00:28:08,59
and incredibly negative
ill informed comments.

372
00:28:08,73 --> 00:28:12,21
I feel from people who you know
in a position to know better

373
00:28:12,21 --> 00:28:13,31
and should be better informed

374
00:28:14,63 --> 00:28:19,86
and in a very sort of heavy handed way
council came out and demolished the house.

375
00:28:20,97 --> 00:28:24,49
Fortunately we don't see you
know that happening too often

376
00:28:24,49 --> 00:28:26,56
that there was a situation in this more

377
00:28:26,56 --> 00:28:32,07
and about 78 maybe a little bit earlier
where lismore council tried to demolish a

378
00:28:32,07 --> 00:28:34,40
couple of houses and they
lost that battle in court

379
00:28:35,11 --> 00:28:40,68
and i think they've really sort of laid
off since then because it costs a lot of

380
00:28:40,68 --> 00:28:44,02
money. You know for councils
to go to court the way

381
00:28:44,02 --> 00:28:49,74
that we see the sort of prejudice coming
through now is just in the the conditions

382
00:28:49,74 --> 00:28:51,91
the dip laced on multiple occupancies

383
00:28:51,91 --> 00:28:55,68
when they put in their development
application the standards

384
00:28:55,68 --> 00:29:01,09
that council requires of them and i
think they're often unreasonable

385
00:29:01,09 --> 00:29:02,78
and also there's not a recognition

386
00:29:02,78 --> 00:29:08,46
that multiple occupancy was designed
really as a form of development

387
00:29:08,46 --> 00:29:12,59
that would provide low cost
housing for low income people

388
00:29:13,38 --> 00:29:19,04
and if you impose really harsh development
conditions onto those people then there

389
00:29:19,04 --> 00:29:22,20
you know they're not able to
comply with them for a start.

390
00:29:22,31 --> 00:29:24,53
So they end up living in a legal situation

391
00:29:25,56 --> 00:29:31,88
and it would price multiple occupancy into
a much more sort of middle class market

392
00:29:31,88 --> 00:29:33,89
so you disenfranchising low income people

393
00:29:35,10 --> 00:29:39,35
and you know really the only opportunity
they have to own their own piece of land

394
00:29:39,35 --> 00:29:43,67
and to build their own house to
give them some sort of security

395
00:29:43,67 --> 00:29:54,97
that i believe everybody has a right
to sort of lost the train now.

396
00:29:57,07 --> 00:30:02,23
Local politics. Do you want to
focus on them and politics. Yes.

397
00:30:02,24 --> 00:30:05,60
Ok.

398
00:30:05,62 --> 00:30:08,85
Politics in them and is
a very complex issue

399
00:30:08,85 --> 00:30:12,83
and i must say in the 15 months

400
00:30:12,83 --> 00:30:19,83
that i've been on council life found it
particularly difficult it times to come to

401
00:30:19,83 --> 00:30:23,96
terms with you'll meet somebody for
instance in one so she'll situation

402
00:30:23,96 --> 00:30:26,92
and they'll say one thing and
then you'll hear that in a.

403
00:30:27,29 --> 00:30:31,27
You know another social situation with a
different group of people they've said

404
00:30:31,27 --> 00:30:35,30
something quite different for me i think.

405
00:30:35,32 --> 00:30:37,30
My observation in nimbin is

406
00:30:37,30 --> 00:30:43,11
that the turning point in community
politics happened probably about two

407
00:30:43,12 --> 00:30:47,61
and a half years ago when the
last federal election was held

408
00:30:47,61 --> 00:30:54,40
and this seat which had been traditionally
a national party seat was lost by

409
00:30:54,41 --> 00:30:58,21
the national party to the
labor party and i would say

410
00:30:58,21 --> 00:31:01,20
that helen caldicott who was a long time.

411
00:31:01,50 --> 00:31:03,51
Peace campaigner who
stood as an independent

412
00:31:03,51 --> 00:31:10,15
and had a great deal of appeal to people
in this electorate was really the key

413
00:31:10,15 --> 00:31:12,96
reason why that seat was won by labor

414
00:31:12,96 --> 00:31:17,00
and lost by the national party
subsequently to that they were.

415
00:31:17,56 --> 00:31:23,27
A resurgence of activity by the
national party within this whole area

416
00:31:23,27 --> 00:31:26,81
and nim and wasn't sort of spared that act

417
00:31:26,81 --> 00:31:33,46
that activity at the same time in
nimbin there were people developers who

418
00:31:33,46 --> 00:31:37,44
moved into the area who bought up a lot
of the land surrounding the village

419
00:31:37,44 --> 00:31:41,48
and who were very keen to
see nim and develop so

420
00:31:41,48 --> 00:31:45,01
that was putting a lot of pressure
on their men and combined with

421
00:31:45,01 --> 00:31:48,97
that there was their debate about whether
to put in a centralized series came into

422
00:31:48,97 --> 00:31:50,33
the village that.
