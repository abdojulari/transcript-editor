1
00:00:33,47 --> 00:00:46,34
This is Station eleven site two about to commence. Well that was the fellowship and that was the kind of work.

2
00:00:46,5 --> 00:01:02,59
It did it cared about the people and just in finishing off. If you put it very it was a very interesting experience.

3
00:01:02,65 --> 00:01:11,16
First of all. The state elections were coming out. And at that time it was a Labor government.

4
00:01:11,17 --> 00:01:21,43
This was before the eschaton government. Had passed. And we got into care and Caroline Street in Redfern.

5
00:01:21,44 --> 00:01:29,75
At the situation. And we went over there with an ethic pencils painted. Cardboard.

6
00:01:30,2 --> 00:01:43,16
And we spent an evening making posters. And. Someone said where and when are we going to use this. Ourselves Grace.

7
00:01:43,36 --> 00:01:54,65
We will go to the Labor Party. Night the public meeting when they opened their campaign for the elections.

8
00:01:54,67 --> 00:02:02,06
And it will be out in America. HALL I think. But I have to check and.

9
00:02:02,58 --> 00:02:09,47
So we were very excited about that and those of us who had cast in all the cars with people from marriage.

10
00:02:10,16 --> 00:02:23,87
And many of the Labor Party people came on that night and the premier at the time was Catholic.

11
00:02:23,94 --> 00:02:33,66
It isn't and wasn't here for and it was premier after different electorate around the world. Those places.

12
00:02:35,97 --> 00:02:43,94
Will go down with their placards. And packed with labor support.

13
00:02:45,57 --> 00:02:59,51
So there's no way to put up their placards silently and quietly and we learn one whole wall. Oh before we left greed.

14
00:02:59,89 --> 00:03:09,43
There would be no interjections nothing just stand silently and hold their placards.

15
00:03:09,45 --> 00:03:15,03
Well we'll line the whole wall up the meeting place.

16
00:03:15,05 --> 00:03:21,17
And the Labor Party people who are looking him throwing curses black looks at us. You know.

17
00:03:21,48 --> 00:03:34,97
It was pressed to see these people with a placard. And. He couldn't contain it. So he couldn't.

18
00:03:36,37 --> 00:03:41,2
And out of the blue when the premier was addressing the meeting.

19
00:03:41,52 --> 00:03:47,01
He moved into the center of the hall holding his plaque at high above it.

20
00:03:48,44 --> 00:04:00,39
And it was before we were able to change the way. Which discriminated against the preacher or people and his place.

21
00:04:01,41 --> 00:04:10,97
Parliament. Has about. Have they got a color. And he walked out and he said what about us.

22
00:04:12,64 --> 00:04:19,48
At the top of his voice and he was a big man. It was so affected so affected.

23
00:04:20,86 --> 00:04:29,58
And I think that was one of the most effective of most effective of all the demonstrations we have a Hilde.

24
00:04:35,31 --> 00:04:48,39
Now you come back to the fact that see. The referendum was held for cats who was very well established.

25
00:04:48,41 --> 00:04:55,33
And we had four branches in the various states and yourself whilst braincell.

26
00:04:55,35 --> 00:05:05,53
And the Braintree would carry a secretary who would sit on the federal executive of.

27
00:05:05,55 --> 00:05:16,89
So that was that contact with the local groups and for Kathy. And these people secretaries.

28
00:05:18,58 --> 00:05:24,07
It was amazing that in such a short after the Federal Council was formed.

29
00:05:25,09 --> 00:05:35,69
That a greater come from the grassroots right throughout Australia.

30
00:05:35,71 --> 00:05:43,5
Darwin got very active on the matter of equal wages. And.

31
00:05:45,78 --> 00:05:54,95
People who were aware that there was an organisation in existence. That was carried people who were pretty sincere.

32
00:05:54,97 --> 00:06:06,25
And who also had contacts in the federal parliament. And I think they were aware also.

33
00:06:06,86 --> 00:06:14,97
The very fact that they didn't preach religion they didn't preach. Anything.

34
00:06:14,99 --> 00:06:22,18
And they did their best always to have representation from. What was known and then as the Aboriginal.

35
00:06:22,2 --> 00:06:35,41
Conferences if they were held. So. The conference to start it off was held.

36
00:06:35,42 --> 00:06:42,35
I think to start for kept to yourself I think was held like a like part of the year

37
00:06:42,35 --> 00:06:50,2
but I think from then on it was held all the way at least a tad. And so for seventeen years.

38
00:06:50,8 --> 00:06:54,66
I gave up my east to attend conferences.

39
00:06:55,39 --> 00:07:01,44
And there were times when hams and the children would come over it all hop into the car and they'd go camping

40
00:07:01,44 --> 00:07:07,07
and wandering around Canberra and that kind of thing and. Just the conference.

41
00:07:07,23 --> 00:07:14,11
But the first conference after it was formed was held in Melman then Sydney

42
00:07:15,26 --> 00:07:27,59
and we were moving out you know we could feel we were growing. And the conference in verse.

43
00:07:27,61 --> 00:07:35,82
And he made no special favors regardless of what color you were. You had to understand that you were in business.

44
00:07:35,83 --> 00:07:39,4
And you had to abide by the laws of the meeting.

45
00:07:39,92 --> 00:07:52,29
And it didn't matter who is holding the floor or the person it was black or white. It's Times that was just absolutely.

46
00:07:53,02 --> 00:08:07,64
Well. And that was the third country after its formation. There appeared a woman.

47
00:08:09,03 --> 00:08:14,88
In a yellow bright yellow cotton dress. Tiny.

48
00:08:17,15 --> 00:08:23,86
And many Aboriginal people just a few Some had come to say what conditions were like on the east.

49
00:08:24,51 --> 00:08:30,59
And there was someone from the Terrible. Another one who'd come from Box Hill.

50
00:08:31,33 --> 00:08:36,34
A terrible place where the people who are virtually imprisoned

51
00:08:37,46 --> 00:08:50,59
and like coming from North Queensland including one who became president. And that was Joe McGinniss.

52
00:08:50,6 --> 00:08:53,57
And we had a university in which to meet.

53
00:08:55,45 --> 00:09:08,61
But this woman in the US who was pretty vocal and it turned out to be careful. And.

54
00:09:10,58 --> 00:09:18,97
I think in many ways that was the most important conference up to date because it stretched into a state that was

55
00:09:18,97 --> 00:09:36,48
relatively. By the likes of the people who made up for a party conference after sixty or sixty one.

56
00:09:38,67 --> 00:09:49,3
And there was a bit of a delegation from the North Queensland and it was a woman I shall never forget in her name.

57
00:09:49,31 --> 00:09:58,97
Ah was Ruth. WALLACE. And she went to recession that had to do you know.

58
00:09:58,98 --> 00:10:03,9
She got up and she went out front and she told her she was taken away.

59
00:10:03,92 --> 00:10:14,34
And how she was put to work in a fishing factory where you boned fish and. Prepared for canning I suppose.

60
00:10:15,09 --> 00:10:24,25
And how she got a fish bone in her finger. And she never got the fish. She probably would have lived and died.

61
00:10:24,27 --> 00:10:35,74
As a taken away. And she was. She said that finger gave me my freedom.

62
00:10:35,76 --> 00:10:42,92
Because apparently she was taken to the hospital and from there. She was taken out into the world as it were.

63
00:10:44,28 --> 00:10:51,41
It was an amazing story and she held up her little finger and she said my little finger gave me my freedom.

64
00:10:53,25 --> 00:10:55,49
I think I just stopped because I'm not over.
