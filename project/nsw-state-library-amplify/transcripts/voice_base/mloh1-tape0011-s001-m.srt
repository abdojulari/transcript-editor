1
00:00:03,90 --> 00:00:04,12
Well mr.

2
00:00:04,12 --> 00:00:08,18
Edwards. I understand you worked on the
sydney harbour bridge in the workshops for

3
00:00:08,18 --> 00:00:15,10
a time as right. Have you know do
you want the time that was in 1920

4
00:00:15,10 --> 00:00:22,02
eight. I was there for
about ten months and then

5
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:28,14
i got married i was called back on the
railways and went up to cardiff you worked

6
00:00:28,14 --> 00:00:32,91
in the in the workshops i understand. Yes
i work mainly in what we call the heavy

7
00:00:32,91 --> 00:00:37,35
shop that was the shop
that the have to the

8
00:00:39,45 --> 00:00:45,73
preliminary work had been done on the
members and it came up and then we assemble

9
00:00:45,73 --> 00:00:51,44
the innards of the large members and revision
gradually shifted up then to the far

10
00:00:51,44 --> 00:00:53,80
end of the shop where it went in into

11
00:00:53,80 --> 00:01:00,23
a dock and every joint it was my
there before it was taken out then

12
00:01:00,94 --> 00:01:06,88
and floated out from the workshop and taken
out to the bridge and then that piece

13
00:01:06,88 --> 00:01:10,71
would be moved up and another one brought
up. They would make that your point. So

14
00:01:10,71 --> 00:01:17,66
that when they were lifted up onto the
site there was no risk of holes not coming

15
00:01:17,66 --> 00:01:23,42
in the right position and everything
just feeling like you could be like

16
00:01:23,42 --> 00:01:30,16
a jigsaw puzzle. How was the work aligned
and set up in the workshop ready for your

17
00:01:30,16 --> 00:01:37,13
to make the joint. Oh well
when parts were being put

18
00:01:37,13 --> 00:01:37,31
on

19
00:01:37,31 --> 00:01:44,71
a machine for planning or anything
like that me and doormen long's staff

20
00:01:44,71 --> 00:01:51,27
they would set it up with theodolite. So
that everything was just plumb and before

21
00:01:51,27 --> 00:01:57,93
it was worked on then the public works
department. Survivors they would come along

22
00:01:57,93 --> 00:02:03,04
with their theodolite you know everything
was checked and double checked to make

23
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:09,40
sure that it was perfect in all its parts.
So that it would be able to be assembled

24
00:02:10,24 --> 00:02:16,32
exactly how did they check it. Oh well as
i just mentioned lead level that up on

25
00:02:16,32 --> 00:02:22,82
the on the machines and so
they do they use feelers or

26
00:02:22,82 --> 00:02:27,67
and how much to check rivets or my wording
when they were checking rivets years ago

27
00:02:27,67 --> 00:02:31,74
see them going along they might
they might take some time at about

28
00:02:31,74 --> 00:02:37,41
a couple of minutes to determine whether
certain dravot would be loose. If it had

29
00:02:37,41 --> 00:02:44,38
the slightest movement. It'd be marked
and had to be taken out and say they

30
00:02:45,13 --> 00:02:48,83
give the rivet a good hides back
one way and put their finger on

31
00:02:48,83 --> 00:02:53,15
a tap at the other way and if they could
feel the slightest movement out of red

32
00:02:53,15 --> 00:02:57,45
come and then it couldn't be kept of the
head of it couldn't be cut off with oxy it

33
00:02:57,45 --> 00:02:59,02
had to be cut off with

34
00:02:59,02 --> 00:03:05,98
a pneumatic machine. The bottom i could
have to come along and kept there down

35
00:03:05,98 --> 00:03:06,63
there with

36
00:03:06,63 --> 00:03:13,52
a machine you made it machine. And so the
dvd be no damage done to the to the plate

37
00:03:13,52 --> 00:03:19,82
and even before rivers were put
in they would come along with

38
00:03:19,82 --> 00:03:24,76
a little square that would fit down into
the holes and make sure that the holes

39
00:03:24,76 --> 00:03:30,11
were drilled at right angles
to the surface of the material

40
00:03:32,03 --> 00:03:32,24
and when

41
00:03:32,24 --> 00:03:37,09
a joint was made. What with the tolerances
allowed on it but for instance what were

42
00:03:37,09 --> 00:03:43,05
the tolerances was the toilets on the
button i think. Well there was no tolerance

43
00:03:43,05 --> 00:03:48,32
on machined work but and they are
normally hot rivets you are you a drill

44
00:03:48,32 --> 00:03:52,61
a hole about a sixteen bigger
like for a thirteen for

45
00:03:52,61 --> 00:03:55,58
a three quarter to rivet you drilled

46
00:03:55,58 --> 00:03:59,92
a thirteen sixteen hour or
seven eight riveted drill

47
00:03:59,92 --> 00:04:03,58
a fifteen sixteen hole and so on you. It
allowed sixteen to expansion of the hot

48
00:04:03,58 --> 00:04:07,62
river but with the all work
in the bridge was only

49
00:04:07,62 --> 00:04:14,30
a thirty second of an inch. Clearance
allowed for rivets so that you and

50
00:04:14,30 --> 00:04:15,36
you had

51
00:04:15,36 --> 00:04:21,17
a quarter rivet you would just allow another
thirty seconds of an edge for it in to

52
00:04:21,17 --> 00:04:25,15
go in and they always had to be hammered
in because of the expansion of the hot

53
00:04:25,15 --> 00:04:30,77
rivet do you remember in addition to the
the accuracy that was required. You

54
00:04:30,77 --> 00:04:35,09
remember the size of things. Do you ever
come across anything that size anywhere

55
00:04:35,09 --> 00:04:41,36
else. Just repeat that i didn't
do you ever come across any size

56
00:04:42,31 --> 00:04:45,76
of work because the what was
required on the harbour bridge

57
00:04:51,81 --> 00:04:58,69
. Well what used to him
fresh me was the size of

58
00:04:58,69 --> 00:05:05,23
the members. We had to to go ahead
travelling crying as that would that have

59
00:05:05,23 --> 00:05:11,53
a capacity of one hundred twenty ten each
and they would pick those members up that

60
00:05:11,53 --> 00:05:18,30
you see on the bridge now. And they look
tremendously bigger than what they look

61
00:05:19,01 --> 00:05:25,31
when they're out there on the site
where you would see these two

62
00:05:25,32 --> 00:05:31,74
cranes one of each end of i mean lifted
up and carried that from one end of the

63
00:05:31,74 --> 00:05:32,99
shock to the other it was

64
00:05:32,99 --> 00:05:39,78
a tremendous amount of steel that you
see lifted and and take it up in one

65
00:05:39,78 --> 00:05:46,01
piece. When you do you ever go out
on the bridge at all. Now the

66
00:05:46,01 --> 00:05:50,80
first time i went on the bridge was the day
everyday and and i walked across it. I

67
00:05:50,80 --> 00:05:56,68
was never out on the site. You know all the
fabrication was done in the shop where

68
00:05:56,68 --> 00:06:03,03
luna park is now that was where our workshop
i was. Although there's probably still

69
00:06:03,03 --> 00:06:03,36
quite

70
00:06:03,36 --> 00:06:10,24
a lot of people that have the idea that
the bridge was fabricated in england and

71
00:06:10,24 --> 00:06:15,64
brought out here and just put together
that that is quite erroneous every part of

72
00:06:15,64 --> 00:06:20,08
that bridge was fabricated in their workshop
they we're going to where luna park is

73
00:06:20,08 --> 00:06:24,60
now can you tell me exactly the process
of the work of the job you did in the

74
00:06:24,60 --> 00:06:30,42
workshops as it went along. All i
was a mainly assembling i did do

75
00:06:30,42 --> 00:06:37,34
a little bit of marking off but they're
mainly assembling and what we yeah and did

76
00:06:37,35 --> 00:06:43,93
eventually just after the arts were
starting to take shape. So as to keep the

77
00:06:43,93 --> 00:06:49,46
work going in the daytime. We started an
evening shift we used to work from up ask

78
00:06:49,46 --> 00:06:55,72
for an afternoon at 11:30 where he
would assemble members of the bridge

79
00:06:56,93 --> 00:07:03,72
about them together put pins in
and when i say pins there might

80
00:07:03,73 --> 00:07:06,31
figure that then what you normally call

81
00:07:06,31 --> 00:07:12,20
a pin those two pins the size of the holes
you drive those in not drips they are

82
00:07:12,20 --> 00:07:18,83
parallel pins. So support them
in position then the take ship

83
00:07:18,83 --> 00:07:25,04
people they would come along and carry on
the idea of that was to get all the crane

84
00:07:25,04 --> 00:07:27,51
work done. Because it was

85
00:07:27,51 --> 00:07:32,97
a tremendous amount of work that had to be
lifted devout and it used to waste time

86
00:07:32,97 --> 00:07:34,16
if youre waiting for

87
00:07:34,16 --> 00:07:38,49
a crane so thats what we used to do then.
Do you mean what the working conditions

88
00:07:38,49 --> 00:07:45,42
were like in the shop. Oh their working
conditions were quite good at that there

89
00:07:45,42 --> 00:07:51,05
at that time i suppose working conditions
today very much jeff and its quite

90
00:07:51,05 --> 00:07:57,75
a few years since i left the trade
but. They were they were good working

91
00:07:57,75 --> 00:08:04,74
conditions for that time. Do you ever how
you went to work and how you went home

92
00:08:05,72 --> 00:08:12,70
and i used to get the
tram from. From roads by

93
00:08:12,70 --> 00:08:19,21
driving at that. Why get the train from
road going to king street and then walk

94
00:08:19,21 --> 00:08:22,40
down to circular can get the best across

95
00:08:22,40 --> 00:08:29,13
a kit the ferry across out of melting point
and say might just reverse it coming

96
00:08:29,13 --> 00:08:34,36
back there were still plenty of ferries and
buses around eleven o'clock at night. I

97
00:08:34,36 --> 00:08:40,38
was still i got the tram because
in those days they used to call

98
00:08:40,38 --> 00:08:47,36
a tram after midnight there all night
trams and you try to extra fare and but

99
00:08:47,36 --> 00:08:54,31
then that that was counteracted different
morning you get work went for years

100
00:08:55,09 --> 00:09:00,57
you'd go from. From one guy into circular
quay for tuppence and the early morning

101
00:09:00,57 --> 00:09:04,24
on a workman's train
workman's tram which was

102
00:09:04,24 --> 00:09:10,35
a do you remember seeing any of the. The
top people of doormen long around the site

103
00:09:10,35 --> 00:09:16,46
. I as they were. They were
frequently erring on the avon doctor

104
00:09:16,46 --> 00:09:19,43
bradford. He used to come there quite

105
00:09:19,43 --> 00:09:26,20
a lot and it's even on the second shift.
Sometimes you get in there on the second

106
00:09:26,20 --> 00:09:31,51
shift and he would go and talk to anybody
in the shop i didn't matter who he was

107
00:09:32,33 --> 00:09:34,93
there was nobody to inferior for dr.

108
00:09:34,93 --> 00:09:39,85
Bradfield to talk to you and then do you
remember having a conversation with

109
00:09:39,85 --> 00:09:40,06
a mata

110
00:09:41,48 --> 00:09:48,39
a few times i would be going over on the
ferry when i was going over and kept quite

111
00:09:48,39 --> 00:09:55,39
a few times i spoke to him and i remember
once talking to him and. He was talking

112
00:09:55,39 --> 00:10:01,91
about the stresses and strains and that
and how that during the construction.

113
00:10:02,49 --> 00:10:07,96
It was calculated that the work was stand

114
00:10:07,96 --> 00:10:12,60
a wind velocity of up to one hundred twenty
miles an hour not kilometres in those

115
00:10:12,60 --> 00:10:17,02
age but it would stand to
have an average of five

116
00:10:17,03 --> 00:10:21,21
a loss. I think of one hundred twenty
miles an hour ago that was during

117
00:10:21,21 --> 00:10:24,01
construction and of course

118
00:10:24,01 --> 00:10:30,89
a lot of present construction and
there was strengthening pieces bolted

119
00:10:30,89 --> 00:10:37,47
under the inside of the members.
Because at that in the construction

120
00:10:37,47 --> 00:10:39,36
stage the work was on

121
00:10:39,36 --> 00:10:45,04
a tensile strength and tension i
was trying but then when it was

122
00:10:46,50 --> 00:10:47,82
joined together of course it became

123
00:10:47,82 --> 00:10:54,55
a compacted strain and then though those
pieces were taken out and finally

124
00:10:54,56 --> 00:11:00,20
riveted up. Do you remember who was it was
in charge of the other shift in the in

125
00:11:00,20 --> 00:11:07,07
the workshop. The foreman.
That was there when when when

126
00:11:07,07 --> 00:11:12,27
i was there was a chap named
arthur down. I mean i fell

127
00:11:12,27 --> 00:11:18,48
a tale. Can you tell me if. The doorman
longstaff went to different to the

128
00:11:18,48 --> 00:11:23,35
australian people in the ways of work
or in their sort of attitude to working

129
00:11:23,35 --> 00:11:29,47
people. Now we got we got on quite
well i think there would be

130
00:11:29,47 --> 00:11:36,33
a i think bigger proportion
of local men and then

131
00:11:36,33 --> 00:11:42,55
he just brought out for the particular work
on the bridge. What sort of the people

132
00:11:42,55 --> 00:11:48,79
that did come out from elsewhere
where did they come from some came

133
00:11:49,76 --> 00:11:56,43
from ireland scotland and i thought i'd say
the majority of those that did come out

134
00:11:56,43 --> 00:12:02,81
would have been from england and they made
their own way. Norman longer than bring

135
00:12:02,81 --> 00:12:08,67
them. I didn't know of it on the wrong
helping anybody and i think they came with

136
00:12:08,67 --> 00:12:15,47
their own volition. Do you remember any
amusing incidents in the workshop or will

137
00:12:15,47 --> 00:12:17,65
it be sort of its density
and music incidents and

138
00:12:17,65 --> 00:12:23,78
a tragic incident things that stick
in your mind and i know. It is.

139
00:12:25,37 --> 00:12:31,24
It's more or less like in the other. Steel
construction place. There's nothing

140
00:12:32,24 --> 00:12:37,91
that i could recall an amusing wending but
probably there would have been out on

141
00:12:37,91 --> 00:12:38,44
the site

142
00:12:39,59 --> 00:12:45,49
a lot more events would have happened out
there and more casualties there wasn't

143
00:12:45,49 --> 00:12:50,46
much in the way of serious accidents
that i can recall in the workshop.

144
00:12:53,04 --> 00:12:58,93
Do you remember what you did after you got
laid off that. Well i didn't get laid

145
00:12:58,93 --> 00:12:59,67
off. I got

146
00:12:59,67 --> 00:13:05,00
a call from the writer i used to go back
there and that was just at the start of

147
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:11,12
the depression years and i was went up then
and worked in the right way. Workshops

148
00:13:11,12 --> 00:13:15,48
at cardiff. If you work there. All through
the depression. I was there right

149
00:13:15,48 --> 00:13:21,86
through the depression i was at carter
from nineteen twenty nine and 1933 right

150
00:13:21,86 --> 00:13:26,19
through the main four years of the depression
because it wasn't quite over then.

151
00:13:26,25 --> 00:13:32,08
But it was easing off. Do you remember
where you were when you got taken on the

152
00:13:32,08 --> 00:13:35,63
bridge or did you work at it. We are working
on another job immediately before we

153
00:13:35,63 --> 00:13:41,72
are to work now. I was working then on the
air and installation of the boilers that

154
00:13:42,47 --> 00:13:47,71
banner on power showed working for
babcock and wilcox then and i got

155
00:13:47,71 --> 00:13:51,82
a call from don along ceo you know to the
bridge. So i wasn't out of work at all.

156
00:13:53,70 --> 00:13:56,84
So you know we were you one of the lucky
ones. Or was it easier for the people who

157
00:13:56,84 --> 00:14:01,75
were already been tradesmen before.
Well i actually i expect i was

158
00:14:01,75 --> 00:14:07,42
a paid one of the lucky ones. I i never
had any period of unemployment at all

159
00:14:07,42 --> 00:14:12,75
although when we're in the depression
years in the in the right way we run

160
00:14:12,75 --> 00:14:18,47
rationing when you start it off or your
erection off one weekend for that is where

161
00:14:18,47 --> 00:14:24,86
you work three weeks you have one off then
it gradually got expanded out and one in

162
00:14:24,86 --> 00:14:30,37
seven and then it got out about
one in thirteen without pay.

163
00:14:31,86 --> 00:14:36,60
Oh yes. You didn't get paid for the way
for the week or so now. And their wages.

164
00:14:36,81 --> 00:14:38,07
They've gone down

165
00:14:38,07 --> 00:14:44,64
a bit to you might try to
party was and. Resisting the

166
00:14:44,64 --> 00:14:46,25
$5 a week if i found

167
00:14:46,25 --> 00:14:51,71
a week and as i said do you remember how
much you got paid in the workshops. I can

168
00:14:51,71 --> 00:14:57,60
tell you exactly how i was
on this is so if it's

169
00:14:57,60 --> 00:15:03,30
a six panel eleven and she
span eleven and temperance

170
00:15:04,34 --> 00:15:11,25
week getting in on that shift and
what do you is that that was and that

171
00:15:11,25 --> 00:15:18,01
twenty eight twenty nine. And then we do
you when you went on the railways you pay

172
00:15:18,01 --> 00:15:20,82
went down to that i mean
down the years. It went down

173
00:15:20,82 --> 00:15:25,92
a little bit because they used to take in
account that we get paid for holidays of

174
00:15:25,92 --> 00:15:31,45
course in those days the private jobs.
You didn't they didn't even get paid for

175
00:15:31,45 --> 00:15:38,13
public holidays and there was no
paid holidays at all in private

176
00:15:38,14 --> 00:15:44,78
employment in those days we see it one way
holiday. On full pay in the railways and

177
00:15:44,78 --> 00:15:48,16
paid for public holidays and of course
that was taken into account. So

178
00:15:48,16 --> 00:15:49,60
a weekly way would rise was

179
00:15:49,60 --> 00:15:54,54
a little bit lower than the outside people
do you remember any union activity while

180
00:15:54,54 --> 00:16:01,47
you worked on the bridge. And now everything
went along very sprightly i was just

181
00:16:01,47 --> 00:16:07,56
an ordinary member of the
union at my door and i i

182
00:16:08,80 --> 00:16:13,23
took more an active part when i came back
to sydney i was working at the chiller

183
00:16:13,23 --> 00:16:19,01
electric car shops and i was the
union rep there for thirteen years

184
00:16:20,18 --> 00:16:24,06
and i was i mean to the bottom make
is red phone banks with a bottom like

185
00:16:24,06 --> 00:16:30,83
a union will. Is there anything
standing at all that you can think of

186
00:16:30,83 --> 00:16:37,47
that happen to you or your member on the
bridge. Now is just. Everything we need to

187
00:16:37,47 --> 00:16:41,100
have quite smoothly and we never had any
trouble at all. Fact i enjoyed the work

188
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,87
there and it was quite

189
00:16:44,87 --> 00:16:50,03
a trish up whether i left that and went
back onto the railway or i just i just got

190
00:16:50,03 --> 00:16:53,46
married i was only married three weeks but
i got that called back to the right way

191
00:16:53,46 --> 00:16:57,19
. Vishesh

192
00:16:57,20 --> 00:17:01,78
a trish up like their job there and how we
thought well that's going to fizzle out

193
00:17:01,78 --> 00:17:08,20
and better to go on the railways where
their job will carry on. Now. Looking back

194
00:17:08,20 --> 00:17:15,18
on those times you know the bridge
is now fifty years old. Why

195
00:17:15,19 --> 00:17:19,14
do you think of the old coat
hanger now. Well i think it's

196
00:17:20,27 --> 00:17:26,36
a great credit to the work of boilermakers
you know they were trying with the

197
00:17:26,36 --> 00:17:30,88
engineers a society. There and
that's good enough provided i'm

198
00:17:30,88 --> 00:17:36,84
a good bet that work had to be spot on
your member of the it was how it came

199
00:17:36,84 --> 00:17:40,40
together like clockwork when the
job was finished i think that was

200
00:17:40,40 --> 00:17:46,29
a credit to boilermakers what do you think
about the suggestion that they put extra

201
00:17:46,30 --> 00:17:49,06
lines on the bridge now i think it's

202
00:17:49,06 --> 00:17:55,81
a calamity that bridge was never
designed for that. Where where the trams

203
00:17:55,81 --> 00:18:01,67
used to run that was originally meant
to be the future railway line for the

204
00:18:03,95 --> 00:18:10,83
rail out to palm beach the vale was
extremely intended to be standing

205
00:18:10,83 --> 00:18:14,53
up there. And i think it would be

206
00:18:14,53 --> 00:18:19,88
a calamity to alter the
appearance. It would be to be

207
00:18:19,88 --> 00:18:26,34
a desecration i say would be defacing the
the design of the bridge and they are

208
00:18:26,34 --> 00:18:32,47
they talk about the heritage council.

209
00:18:32,49 --> 00:18:39,30
Maintaining things as they are and i
think that they should come under

210
00:18:39,30 --> 00:18:45,04
their control and not allow any. Defacing
of the structure of that bridge at all.

211
00:18:46,94 --> 00:18:48,15
Well thank you very much mr. Edwards.
