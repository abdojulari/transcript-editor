1
00:00:02,57 --> 00:00:06,09
Right wing us got that right.

2
00:00:06,44 --> 00:00:10,74
So you just let the car of the toy shop get into their work

3
00:00:12,55 --> 00:00:22,27
and as for finding here that shit was so wrong on the air they I at the top was pretty good in a while because it was

4
00:00:25,1 --> 00:00:30,89
OK very classic cry the guy put there

5
00:00:31,63 --> 00:00:43,04
and then the sort that you often you know it was amazing how they the Titans used to respond with spies they were

6
00:00:43,12 --> 00:00:46,71
saying why this guy and you're right here.

7
00:00:49,21 --> 00:00:54,95
They say that in Sydney and certainly John the warning pre-war used to be again bulls.

8
00:00:55,59 --> 00:01:01,07
Like this you know I never went as you probably heard about here.

9
00:01:01,66 --> 00:01:09,17
I never went to the mall on a regular vices for the which one was used to bully out of model bottles full of what was a

10
00:01:09,17 --> 00:01:19,06
drank and drank whole of it. Yeah it could but it was supposedly a legitimate fear and this fall.

11
00:01:19,06 --> 00:01:21,56
I wanted to get a friend here.

12
00:01:21,68 --> 00:01:25,22
He wanted to got a breast up a lot of money

13
00:01:25,22 --> 00:01:34,19
and he was a young intention was he want to suck some money in here see a little money dressed up beautifully here

14
00:01:34,19 --> 00:01:47,25
and then why we went down after we knew that there were people need rest room where we are for not all sleep which was

15
00:01:47,25 --> 00:01:53,33
the store where he and Byron their style crime demand was and if they had a wife.

16
00:01:53,36 --> 00:02:00,05
If you SHARP Did you just find of sort of what's what you're here. Anyway finished up in the middle.

17
00:02:03,63 --> 00:02:13,93
The panic was there was going to rescue me here. Then I think myself or soon as he went off one step removed from it.

18
00:02:16,65 --> 00:02:23,02
But he did it when he didn't go to the bit with a Black Berry and think at that size a large cause with care.

19
00:02:23,09 --> 00:02:35,12
That's a roll over not getting away with we've many of them were what they call some kind of came at the scene in town

20
00:02:35,12 --> 00:02:40,92
here. You know if there's any of it hold of a type heading off and go here by phone.

21
00:02:40,93 --> 00:02:45,57
I think where else is there anything here that you

22
00:02:45,57 --> 00:02:54,79
or I think of your the number two bins being on in the car down there what they've done now they've done they've

23
00:02:54,79 --> 00:03:00,12
reached the voting saw and it's got cinemas and stuff like that but we were a kid when I was kid in the forty's.

24
00:03:00,19 --> 00:03:03,54
We used to go have school run pensions and things here

25
00:03:03,54 --> 00:03:08,27
and it was just the place he was used to those levels up you could go off

26
00:03:08,27 --> 00:03:10,69
and sit in the little balconies around the kids

27
00:03:10,69 --> 00:03:15,61
or just be playing around a little writing thing about the book another verse so much bigger than me

28
00:03:15,61 --> 00:03:16,44
and never never will.

29
00:03:16,46 --> 00:03:22,75
The son never look at the now I wish to say to join a postal mail here and there

30
00:03:22,75 --> 00:03:32,82
and the things from there be far out of our there that they are all from you.

31
00:03:32,83 --> 00:03:44,02
There you know this is a white way back into the night so I rang up and sure

32
00:03:44,02 --> 00:03:55,28
when they were assured by white wires here. One little one some sour this is window where are you.

33
00:03:55,29 --> 00:04:06,99
I should try for the money was good boy oh boy. Now. Just the thought that a bit of the noise.

34
00:04:08,21 --> 00:04:12,04
I don't wish to live

35
00:04:12,42 --> 00:04:27,37
or if you want to come whenever the front door to get out of any lines I saw that there was a howl of the girls getting

36
00:04:27,37 --> 00:04:40,86
the food they didn't want to wipe just to get there so they asked the boys to know some of you why this might be in

37
00:04:40,86 --> 00:04:51,54
your eyes. They are a little boy you know that you are watching the family there that never fighting in Spain a right.

38
00:04:51,67 --> 00:05:01,78
If it sounds like a noise for me annoyed.

39
00:05:02,03 --> 00:05:15,69
Well but greatest That will vary from one simple anything and there's a long way off if silence of a point

40
00:05:16,1 --> 00:05:28,38
or three of the books there that the surprise was I used to always get a few part of what I used to do was a double lie

41
00:05:28,38 --> 00:05:36,46
of the prize and or sorry that was about a run for the area was right.

42
00:05:37,66 --> 00:05:51,97
Girls of a long time before fashion marched for their lives getting back if it meant. I just don't just happen here.

43
00:05:52,73 --> 00:05:58,76
If I feel like I should go there but I'm still here.

44
00:06:01,56 --> 00:06:13,46
Five dollars five Yeah but then I got a lot since I put a few extra time going like the robot

45
00:06:14,13 --> 00:06:19,52
and really going to the professional or the what a lot of lawyers get where they're going anywhere.

46
00:06:19,55 --> 00:06:29,1
I said I said The manager said come back in a second.

47
00:06:29,18 --> 00:06:37,15
The second time in a little bit but the second one go to our talking about set up

48
00:06:37,15 --> 00:06:41,81
and he said You give them the security

49
00:06:41,81 --> 00:06:52,27
and do it simple enough if enough so he said we'll just have a guy in the north just one of the boys.

50
00:06:52,48 --> 00:07:06,37
If you and I got here and when I went in the baron kept me at the lively five so that the one they like got through.

51
00:07:06,51 --> 00:07:20,32
Anyway I sat where I was might get by on unless he applied to ask for a show I got a wireless router six hundred five

52
00:07:20,32 --> 00:07:21,11
or four.

53
00:07:21,25 --> 00:07:28,55
You were there with a beer when you get to finally seven twenty you're full of shit about seventy five

54
00:07:28,55 --> 00:07:37,07
but none of the little guy there and then or a young fifty five by the door with the full finish.

55
00:07:37,28 --> 00:07:46,18
There we should be proud of America for not run in the hours prior Now to the boys in an hour after that point.

56
00:07:46,36 --> 00:08:00,9
Not so good for you though it might be one year or so that Homer more like you still like to hear what end.

57
00:08:06,3 --> 00:08:13,96
You know only too much. So either you are on board or are silly to try to get back to our good.

58
00:08:14,08 --> 00:08:32,32
So that they could strike me last year or avoiding our doctor on the spot that this is an order. In a five story.

59
00:08:32,48 --> 00:08:44,5
She was right that they are in the mental but I want you to question the if you are let out.

60
00:08:46,16 --> 00:09:04,25
Oh yes it really here she comes up here and there are more than a fortnight after after she divorced and

61
00:09:04,25 --> 00:09:20,34
when I saw her she there. She put a net income but she put the average price for it on the way out there on the run.

62
00:09:20,44 --> 00:09:28,3
Yet I was fine. My friends for their kids and the oyster right now the huge one right there.

63
00:09:29,76 --> 00:09:41,68
Lots of my iron and ship and ship for the poor expensive stuff. Yes but she had it on the private by story.

64
00:09:41,71 --> 00:09:45,21
What the it was an extension five a top surface.

65
00:09:45,57 --> 00:09:47,61
So it will come

66
00:09:48,37 --> 00:09:57,38
when you put it they have sold out there that she bought her Arsenal rival for that with a fit of the title such as

67
00:09:57,38 --> 00:10:01,87
don't get on here in stride. Right.

68
00:10:02,51 --> 00:10:11,96
Sure you have a choice and right now on the lower right the the she was like I might go in there

69
00:10:11,96 --> 00:10:18,59
and back saying I abort the camera and I show up there.

70
00:10:19,8 --> 00:10:31,48
What I'm ready for the time they go off there with a look at what I've read that of course I said except it.

71
00:10:31,51 --> 00:10:45,54
Did not say I said she was sort of in with what I say it was a strong ally for her and went on the air six months.

72
00:10:46,41 --> 00:10:52,28
Writing and or putting a job in the mines on what I'm up here

73
00:10:53,25 --> 00:11:03,28
and there are some other guys around making that they hear

74
00:11:03,94 --> 00:11:14,76
or something is full of flowers that are going to actually bar spies off blocking as much any miles that they had their

75
00:11:14,76 --> 00:11:15,07
lines.

76
00:11:15,16 --> 00:11:24,68
So we wouldn't love each other here in the elites marriage there and he said look he said we can't go in there again

77
00:11:24,68 --> 00:11:35,61
or down to the office of the U.S. To try to the family trust money and the very last he said before work.

78
00:11:35,63 --> 00:11:37,25
Something and any one

79
00:11:37,25 --> 00:11:52,39
or chunk of them think that that's why they sit on one of their sign things for them which rather than buy them that.

80
00:11:52,43 --> 00:12:00,39
So I don't vote on it the same way that I saw it.

81
00:12:01,55 --> 00:12:17,53
You are sort of when you are the sort of prize in the business on a ship or in the swimming pool or on fire.

82
00:12:17,58 --> 00:12:18,63
The glow of the bike

83
00:12:18,63 --> 00:12:31,21
and just any line with the sort of from the outward things that were going up on the last word if that you are is sort

84
00:12:31,21 --> 00:12:46,35
of like him. You found the four losses in Marseilles by how much she knew him when he went down there.

85
00:12:46,52 --> 00:13:00,52
Why we did the world around him that she was a rich man which on this in a while I think she possibly knew that

86
00:13:00,52 --> 00:13:04,99
something around five or it would never right.

87
00:13:05,01 --> 00:13:21,52
There's not one will she not know who reacted like the end of the wife the wife of the struck one of the one on the

88
00:13:21,52 --> 00:13:28,82
right. Or something that could arrange with anybody. If the fun is a euro. So I asked.

89
00:13:28,86 --> 00:13:39,11
I'd much rather it was an affair with us. And these guys will privately and then once that is us left here.

90
00:13:39,89 --> 00:13:48,59
And I guess I'll sing a silent down there saying oh it was a night where the Irish writer and I got it

91
00:13:48,59 --> 00:13:54,75
and then I'll actually get on something and now often this is right.

92
00:13:54,81 --> 00:14:01,21
Richie with you this is going to be the end or go after that so you know what I will try though.

93
00:14:01,7 --> 00:14:07,37
Oh yes and the side back up by the bottom of your back

94
00:14:07,37 --> 00:14:15,25
and also oh this is the vanishing direct that's needed a checkbook there and it's not the case for you. So it's wrong.

95
00:14:15,32 --> 00:14:23,37
The fact that that never question if you left it in the intro here was a nice guy there

96
00:14:23,37 --> 00:14:37,13
and I sat with plenty of a filing here then any aria which is sort of they want to go around the world for it

97
00:14:37,13 --> 00:14:44,35
and I'm going to start with the why is that stand there

98
00:14:44,35 --> 00:14:51,67
and you know what are you going to top there that we still have the opportunity for us.

99
00:14:51,76 --> 00:14:56,11
So I'm still working in the boy with just the number one. So when you hear it.

100
00:14:56,28 --> 00:15:01,71
We did a few some here and I talked to my family.

101
00:15:01,85 --> 00:15:13,81
We're going to do that just to get out of the starting line more must be that six months I'm sorry you know some of the

102
00:15:13,81 --> 00:15:24,09
forty seven are just for some of the day that he was going to fight a war you will resonate here in the West

103
00:15:24,09 --> 00:15:27,88
and why because you can't fight

104
00:15:27,88 --> 00:15:36,97
but no it certainly need to get higher back in these wars something I thought that was not one way that none of them

105
00:15:36,97 --> 00:15:52,46
actually. She laid out more. And you actually are in a lot of what you say with what happened.

106
00:15:52,53 --> 00:16:01,44
Or did not go away when you actually get up and I swear if you let me know it was but if you go.

107
00:16:01,52 --> 00:16:14,3
Of once again if I ever thought he could take you anywhere I want. But eventually got that's got to get there.

108
00:16:14,65 --> 00:16:20,51
He said The trouble is you know I'll tell you all their lives and then you come with noise on down there

109
00:16:20,51 --> 00:16:35,77
and say come on it's a comfort door on the second part of one of them everything that's a surprise to me he said I'm

110
00:16:35,77 --> 00:16:40,77
here he said My thing is I don't want you to come all right.

111
00:16:41,49 --> 00:16:45,31
And so we leave this one here

112
00:16:45,34 --> 00:16:53,96
or shine where this comes to get our lives for you to retreat very well off the sidewalk listen to what I mean are you

113
00:16:53,96 --> 00:17:03,93
surprised I was coming back or what having I want to know and which aren't.
