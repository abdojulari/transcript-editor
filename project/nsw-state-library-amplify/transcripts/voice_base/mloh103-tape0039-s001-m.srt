1
00:00:21,82 --> 00:00:26,65
This is karen's about interviewing rina
parent in this mall on the 5th of may 1993

2
00:00:27,48 --> 00:00:29,94
type to bring up.

3
00:00:31,03 --> 00:00:35,90
Tell me about some of the school stories.

4
00:00:37,73 --> 00:00:40,59
Can you remember anything
particular about going to school.

5
00:00:40,66 --> 00:00:44,89
Well the thing that sticks mostly in
my mind is when we went to my brother

6
00:00:44,89 --> 00:00:46,43
and i mean to you guys school.

7
00:00:47,84 --> 00:00:51,58
My parents couldn't speak english so
obviously they wouldn't take us to school

8
00:00:51,58 --> 00:00:55,29
and i was elderly and my brother
had too much work to do.

9
00:00:55,32 --> 00:00:58,86
Everyone had so much work to do
that we had to go on our own.

10
00:00:58,88 --> 00:01:04,28
So from right up on top was colgan ali
we went down to the jaeger or school.

11
00:01:05,63 --> 00:01:09,64
We went in the school ran and stood
there a part because nobody knew us.

12
00:01:10,24 --> 00:01:13,62
When the bell rang to go in we
marched in with the other kids.

13
00:01:13,95 --> 00:01:15,50
The thing that we had nowhere to sleep.

14
00:01:15,68 --> 00:01:19,41
We just stood in front of the class

15
00:01:19,41 --> 00:01:24,70
when everyone was seated the teacher turned
towards us is no i'm with mr mcnaught

16
00:01:26,49 --> 00:01:31,55
and he said why are you here and
my brother who was older than i

17
00:01:31,55 --> 00:01:35,16
but he was a bit more timid
myself. He didn't say anything.

18
00:01:35,31 --> 00:01:37,29
So i said because my mother sent me.

19
00:01:38,73 --> 00:01:42,64
So then he did say this but it wasn't
a very good introduction to school

20
00:01:43,53 --> 00:01:45,95
but i rather liked school
so i got on all right.

21
00:01:47,27 --> 00:01:52,08
And he was the only one that gave
me the cane and even to this day

22
00:01:53,60 --> 00:01:58,33
when i got back i know what i got it for
what did you get it for where we were

23
00:01:58,33 --> 00:02:01,29
waiting outside. And we
were sitting in stools

24
00:02:01,29 --> 00:02:05,05
and he told us we were to
read a post paragraph each

25
00:02:05,91 --> 00:02:12,34
and i loved reading aloud especially and
the girl next to me just kept on and on

26
00:02:12,34 --> 00:02:18,05
and on and she wouldn't sit down. So i
gave above it got above this and gamertag.

27
00:02:19,03 --> 00:02:22,07
And i don't know if she stumbled or
what but anyway the teacher saw me

28
00:02:22,07 --> 00:02:24,19
and you got me to cut.

29
00:02:24,21 --> 00:02:29,25
And i came up english food on my hand
and i just think i deserved it for

30
00:02:29,25 --> 00:02:31,33
that maybe he had other ideas

31
00:02:32,03 --> 00:02:40,53
but he had read here i might it not read
here i thought i might have made a blue.

32
00:02:41,24 --> 00:02:46,21
What kind of lunches did you take to school.
Don't talk to me about lunches caring.

33
00:02:47,94 --> 00:02:51,59
We had to have homemade
bread. And i hated it.

34
00:02:52,70 --> 00:02:55,34
Everybody had this nice square board bread

35
00:02:55,34 --> 00:02:59,99
and we had home my grade in the
summer it was really delicious.

36
00:03:00,26 --> 00:03:03,88
You could smell it you know cooking
in the winter wasn't so successful

37
00:03:04,58 --> 00:03:06,87
that my mother or my sister used to do it.

38
00:03:06,96 --> 00:03:11,12
She used to make it sort of in a
long bun. And that wasn't square.

39
00:03:11,32 --> 00:03:16,29
I wanted square bread and on top
of that i had to help make it.

40
00:03:16,29 --> 00:03:19,57
What would be to get the used.

41
00:03:20,75 --> 00:03:25,74
And in the beginning i somehow made
the yeast out of the stomach of carbs

42
00:03:25,74 --> 00:03:27,00
or something i never did.

43
00:03:28,37 --> 00:03:31,08
I can't even tell you there might
be other people i can tell you

44
00:03:31,08 --> 00:03:31,78
that if you go along

45
00:03:33,92 --> 00:03:37,48
that we might you might they might it would
be usually used about a flower in the

46
00:03:37,48 --> 00:03:44,04
would be about a hundred pound bags
i think of like a corn bag and

47
00:03:44,05 --> 00:03:47,43
that said it. Sorry. Was it
problem keeping the flour.

48
00:03:48,81 --> 00:03:52,67
Well not so much for us because
we did use a lot. Sort of thing.

49
00:03:52,83 --> 00:03:54,34
Not that i can remember. Anyway.

50
00:03:55,03 --> 00:03:56,92
And then that's the state

51
00:03:56,92 --> 00:03:59,65
and then of course it had to be need
you know you turn it over and over.

52
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,80
So they devised a contraption
which was about a creek.

53
00:04:03,88 --> 00:04:07,22
Or two and a half foot square board.

54
00:04:07,24 --> 00:04:11,18
And then on that it had a stick a
text to it with some bolts in the end

55
00:04:11,18 --> 00:04:14,26
and i was the one that had to go up
and down up and down with the stick.

56
00:04:14,33 --> 00:04:19,79
While the others turned bread into it
and so that's the story about braid

57
00:04:19,79 --> 00:04:25,42
and i just feel completely how
awful i felt taking that brave.

58
00:04:25,43 --> 00:04:28,43
And if we ran out.
Sometimes you know a map.

59
00:04:28,70 --> 00:04:30,82
And this is strange because this is

60
00:04:30,82 --> 00:04:35,47
that reminded me the other day my
elder sister would make patty cakes.

61
00:04:36,50 --> 00:04:40,85
So it would was a to home my bread
or patty cakes. How many lies.

62
00:04:41,04 --> 00:04:46,07
How many lies would they would you
make in a session. Well efficient.

63
00:04:46,14 --> 00:04:49,91
Well i think i don't remember but we
used to make it nearly every day.

64
00:04:50,91 --> 00:04:53,76
So it was always fresh bread.

65
00:04:54,48 --> 00:04:58,10
And now i mean you know fresh bread
being thing wouldn't my word.

66
00:04:58,93 --> 00:05:00,45
I'm tired but would you take with it.

67
00:05:02,23 --> 00:05:03,00
Mostly cheese

68
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:06,61
or jam i think you know i think within
the medics i think i didn't know about

69
00:05:06,61 --> 00:05:08,97
peanut butter all but you might nosedive.

70
00:05:09,75 --> 00:05:11,88
I suppose it was around that
we didn't know about it.

71
00:05:13,86 --> 00:05:19,34
And another thing i remember from
that same school was in wartime.

72
00:05:19,63 --> 00:05:22,99
I might be jumping ahead of me but
it doesn't matter in during the war.

73
00:05:23,21 --> 00:05:25,68
This was to go school.
You guys school yes.

74
00:05:26,34 --> 00:05:30,17
I would have been about
13 or close on the 14.

75
00:05:30,18 --> 00:05:34,66
And that will destroy sydney
thing italians destroy him.

76
00:05:34,80 --> 00:05:39,70
Both of them our call only
and everyone was so happy

77
00:05:39,70 --> 00:05:42,93
that the teacher gave
us a half of a holiday.

78
00:05:42,95 --> 00:05:46,22
So home i went and i think i can your home

79
00:05:46,22 --> 00:05:48,12
and i think we've got a half day holiday.

80
00:05:49,79 --> 00:05:53,14
I because the save me saying the book

81
00:05:53,14 --> 00:05:56,79
that i'm now quietly only
where you should have seen.

82
00:05:56,81 --> 00:05:59,47
I said don't you know that
that's an italian ship.

83
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,30
And we're all italians on that
and our countrymen. Thanks.

84
00:06:04,88 --> 00:06:07,23
I didn't how i was a
tell you. No i just did.

85
00:06:07,39 --> 00:06:09,79
Yes it must have been a
bit confusing as a child.

86
00:06:10,16 --> 00:06:12,10
Well it was confusing in a way

87
00:06:12,10 --> 00:06:17,12
that our life didn't change at all because
my brother would naturalised therefore

88
00:06:17,12 --> 00:06:22,78
we had a radio all the time and he
had a gun which. Unnatural lives.

89
00:06:22,83 --> 00:06:28,55
People had to put in. And they
also had to give their idea.

90
00:06:28,57 --> 00:06:32,59
But we had this big i think they
used to call it a dual. Right.

91
00:06:32,70 --> 00:06:34,83
It was a big contraption anyway about.

92
00:06:35,25 --> 00:06:38,14
To have a wide but three feet high

93
00:06:39,73 --> 00:06:45,17
and we would be able to catch the transmissions
from either seen so far as i can

94
00:06:45,17 --> 00:06:48,61
remember they're always trying
to listen to news from italy.

95
00:06:49,10 --> 00:06:51,46
I don't know if they've had any.

96
00:06:51,48 --> 00:06:55,64
Say if he if he wasn't a naturalized as it
illegal for him to have that right here.

97
00:06:55,71 --> 00:06:57,59
Yes they would have taken
it off but now that

98
00:06:57,59 --> 00:07:03,06
and the time during this is during the war
you know it's you know i was about 14

99
00:07:03,06 --> 00:07:04,18
then.

100
00:07:04,90 --> 00:07:08,79
Yes i was there any danger you know

101
00:07:08,79 --> 00:07:12,54
that the men in your family be taken
prisoner of war during those years.

102
00:07:12,85 --> 00:07:17,37
Well i suppose there was
always the danger but.

103
00:07:18,20 --> 00:07:21,54
None of our family when my
father was rather elderly.

104
00:07:21,56 --> 00:07:24,20
And they would have to have some evidence

105
00:07:24,20 --> 00:07:30,43
that i had been in the faceted party in
a plea which none of us were my brother

106
00:07:30,43 --> 00:07:36,75
left when he was 18. So it was no
way he could have been but simon.

107
00:07:37,01 --> 00:07:41,41
I just like to say here that the feelings
for the mum motherland was too strong.

108
00:07:41,93 --> 00:07:43,75
At that time.

109
00:07:43,77 --> 00:07:50,01
And you can understand more they would
want to listen to news and even people

110
00:07:50,01 --> 00:07:53,02
that knew that we had the right ear
and i'd ask did you hear any news.

111
00:07:53,45 --> 00:07:55,87
You know it was one thing

112
00:07:55,87 --> 00:07:58,83
that the australians sort of
found him hard to understand.

113
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,88
But if you think that if you
had been in a strange country

114
00:08:05,01 --> 00:08:11,11
and couldn't speak the language. It would
have been nice to hear your own town.

115
00:08:13,28 --> 00:08:15,50
But of course it was warm and.

116
00:08:15,52 --> 00:08:22,29
There was no you didn't hear your parents
be talking about anyone else being

117
00:08:22,30 --> 00:08:23,92
taken this.

118
00:08:23,93 --> 00:08:27,50
Through their formulae were
others but i just probably need

119
00:08:27,50 --> 00:08:30,00
but i just forget the names now.

120
00:08:31,14 --> 00:08:36,13
And maybe sort of you know and i
wouldn't want to be put in any way.

121
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:38,74
But i remember one one time.

122
00:08:40,35 --> 00:08:44,66
Just to tell you sort of how how hard
things were this is going back a while

123
00:08:44,66 --> 00:08:47,92
when i was about 10. My
mother was very sick.

124
00:08:48,30 --> 00:08:51,97
She had to go to hospital she had
three operations in the one go.

125
00:08:53,32 --> 00:08:55,26
And everyone thought that
she wouldn't make it.

126
00:08:56,07 --> 00:08:57,66
That was the feeling that we had at home.

127
00:08:58,86 --> 00:09:01,95
But i didn't go and say it because i
didn't have a decent drop to put on

128
00:09:03,45 --> 00:09:04,63
and being poor.

129
00:09:04,67 --> 00:09:05,61
But proud

130
00:09:05,61 --> 00:09:11,60
and especially my mother was a very proud
woman she wouldn't want to probably even

131
00:09:11,60 --> 00:09:13,13
see me if i wasn't dressed properly.

132
00:09:13,39 --> 00:09:16,46
But anyway the decision was
made that i didn't go and see

133
00:09:16,46 --> 00:09:19,93
and she didn't like it by the way
i lived not to be nobody to.

134
00:09:20,60 --> 00:09:26,66
What was wrong with her one was the
goldstone one will be in the x

135
00:09:26,66 --> 00:09:28,48
and the other one has come a good form

136
00:09:30,05 --> 00:09:34,34
and out dr. mccabe performed the operation
she'd been to doctors in sydney

137
00:09:34,34 --> 00:09:40,83
and all over the place because she was so
sick and a family had what was wrong and.

138
00:09:41,41 --> 00:09:47,05
She made it and was pretty healthy
after that point with a doctor.

139
00:09:47,07 --> 00:09:53,03
I don't know what he was engaged
to have offices on the corner of.

140
00:09:54,56 --> 00:09:58,77
Ok and mouse with street i think he
was in this and he was in business.

141
00:09:58,98 --> 00:10:01,60
Yes you know he was a. There's
more not a very old up

142
00:10:01,60 --> 00:10:04,33
that i'll manage what he would
have been ideal something on him.

143
00:10:05,47 --> 00:10:09,47
And i remember going in to say my mother.

144
00:10:09,47 --> 00:10:12,68
I'm not like light a time
when she had a bad shoulder.

145
00:10:13,52 --> 00:10:18,65
And she said she said get me up at 3 o'clock
in the morning she said wash mission.

146
00:10:18,74 --> 00:10:21,73
I can get warm again she
said i'm just freezing cold.

147
00:10:22,03 --> 00:10:24,36
All guys do you think they
can do anything about it.

148
00:10:25,29 --> 00:10:30,18
So i made it my business to be there
when dr. mckay come and i said to him.

149
00:10:30,22 --> 00:10:35,53
Doctor i think months said so and
such and he turned to the nurse

150
00:10:35,53 --> 00:10:38,51
and said why do you washer.
That unearthly time.

151
00:10:38,99 --> 00:10:44,80
And she's about doctor she said that's a
routine we wash patients in that time

152
00:10:44,80 --> 00:10:50,69
and he said leave a dirty then and after
that she was washed in the daytime.

153
00:10:51,52 --> 00:10:56,27
So she would have been in the original
base hospital. You know she was in.

154
00:10:58,32 --> 00:11:00,78
Current dangerous think
at the time you know

155
00:11:00,78 --> 00:11:05,04
that was carried out you know current
then and there would also be.

156
00:11:05,06 --> 00:11:10,21
Water away hospital.
Where with a situation.

157
00:11:10,50 --> 00:11:15,03
Are you asking me too much neck area
and i don't know. I think that a fact.

158
00:11:15,03 --> 00:11:17,53
I tried to go past where i
thought the current you know was

159
00:11:17,53 --> 00:11:23,71
and i couldn't find it there was also
the don griles which was originally the

160
00:11:23,71 --> 00:11:28,42
aerosol club which you mother ever in
there may have it was one hospital

161
00:11:28,42 --> 00:11:31,53
but i can't remember going to.

162
00:11:33,52 --> 00:11:36,22
Reno what was it like being the
youngest of such a large family.

163
00:11:38,48 --> 00:11:43,50
Well i didn't i wasn't spoiled to what
you're trying to get out of caring

164
00:11:43,50 --> 00:11:49,17
and i certainly wasn't it wasn't.
Enraged everybody much for anybody.

165
00:11:49,21 --> 00:11:54,36
So nothing nothing me i
mean you can see me.

166
00:11:55,51 --> 00:11:58,12
Sometimes i reckon but i just
grew up going by what up.

167
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,85
Because there just wasn't time sick
when i was young she was very sick

168
00:12:04,85 --> 00:12:09,26
and being the youngest didn't get you
out of doing any chores no no no no my

169
00:12:09,26 --> 00:12:10,81
brother. It was a wonder did that.

170
00:12:11,74 --> 00:12:16,62
He since passed away was killed in
an accident in sydney in the map.

171
00:12:16,64 --> 00:12:21,09
You know he was the one who could get
away with it. I mean i was to stop them.

172
00:12:22,28 --> 00:12:26,32
You know so i mean i didn't
ever call embody me by name.

173
00:12:27,43 --> 00:12:28,47
So i'm used to always get into trouble.

174
00:12:32,11 --> 00:12:34,80
You don't you know decide
but it was a fact.

175
00:12:34,82 --> 00:12:38,20
Anyway so why do you remember
much about your sister.

176
00:12:38,46 --> 00:12:42,66
I know you don't remember about her but do
you know much about you. Sister the nun.

177
00:12:43,83 --> 00:12:45,00
You know i mean very little.

178
00:12:45,25 --> 00:12:50,94
That was told to me she died
when she was 28 in the convent.

179
00:12:51,08 --> 00:12:53,85
What part of the holy where
was she where was she

180
00:12:53,85 --> 00:12:59,72
and i think she was went to rome after she
went into the convent she would be to

181
00:12:59,72 --> 00:13:02,31
bury early age about 17.

182
00:13:03,72 --> 00:13:05,95
And i know my mother had a
big fight a grandfather

183
00:13:05,95 --> 00:13:10,44
and she got an enlarged later on but.

184
00:13:11,84 --> 00:13:18,22
She really never entered into my life and
kind of when did you make your husband.

185
00:13:20,96 --> 00:13:26,46
I mean one of the few dances i went to
rejig there were a lot of bands right.

186
00:13:26,48 --> 00:13:30,52
But i didn't go to many because i
had to be chaperone and my grandma.

187
00:13:30,79 --> 00:13:35,68
Were doing everything but occasionally i
would rather the dance of the jingle.

188
00:13:35,89 --> 00:13:36,90
And i think maybe.

189
00:13:38,38 --> 00:13:45,21
But then you know boys used to call on the
home front row he probably would have

190
00:13:45,21 --> 00:13:51,53
called and hand. Probably would have a
young child there a few young boys around.

191
00:13:52,23 --> 00:13:55,74
And i remember my sister and particularly.

192
00:13:55,76 --> 00:13:59,95
Job because he had a lot of
hair or a lamb and he had a.

193
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,77
Pregame start wars we just play mode

194
00:14:03,66 --> 00:14:06,88
and leave these marks as you
have been back in cama games

195
00:14:06,88 --> 00:14:10,47
but any writing you didn't wear
a lot of hair obsolete remarks.

196
00:14:12,15 --> 00:14:15,39
And so it went on from there
and good name to be oh.

197
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:17,75
It's your parents

198
00:14:17,75 --> 00:14:24,45
and brought with him he was born in
italy to be in place called bina

199
00:14:27,04 --> 00:14:29,70
and he came out here when
he was 18 years old.

200
00:14:29,83 --> 00:14:32,23
How old were you when you met your husband

201
00:14:33,88 --> 00:14:40,11
when i met him i was probably about 16
and then we started going to get them

202
00:14:40,11 --> 00:14:46,24
and i was 17. Did you where you shop around
for years. You couldn't go anywhere.

203
00:14:48,52 --> 00:14:51,17
And i think we didn't go up.

204
00:14:51,20 --> 00:14:56,62
Mary much really because my
brothers wouldn't come to that and

205
00:14:56,63 --> 00:15:01,34
and finally much eternal and i got
the picture and i might come.

206
00:15:02,78 --> 00:15:07,50
But you know what according to done at
my place but hey if you pay me company.

207
00:15:07,65 --> 00:15:11,86
We talk and everyone got discreetly
debate and we started happening 12.

208
00:15:11,91 --> 00:15:15,42
So you were allowed to be in the same
room on your way as yet we were at that

209
00:15:15,42 --> 00:15:18,67
or even australia day you could
run random it in a central.

210
00:15:19,08 --> 00:15:23,21
You didn't have the elderly member there's
a family following you know to just

211
00:15:23,21 --> 00:15:28,56
discredit instance you know now you know
what i mean you knew you didn't have to go

212
00:15:28,56 --> 00:15:29,00
too far.

213
00:15:30,43 --> 00:15:35,61
So what was life like as a young woman
going into a young girl growing into

214
00:15:35,61 --> 00:15:41,71
womanhood. For my part. It
was rather can i say world.

215
00:15:43,59 --> 00:15:45,30
Because we didn't go anywhere.

216
00:15:45,69 --> 00:15:50,38
We didn't do anything that went any
young people my age at all around.

217
00:15:50,66 --> 00:15:55,34
We need my sister got married four years.

218
00:15:55,43 --> 00:15:59,95
That's a 19. So that
really wasn't very much.

219
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,49
Today why did have a family strike you.

220
00:16:02,55 --> 00:16:03,14
Friends

221
00:16:03,14 --> 00:16:08,42
but we didn't really mix very much at all
in the matter of fact i remember one time

222
00:16:08,42 --> 00:16:11,23
i'd made a sort of a friend.

223
00:16:12,28 --> 00:16:14,59
Where we used to buy
grace rated merengue and

224
00:16:15,84 --> 00:16:20,38
and she would have me to go to the
show with and we'd meet at the show.

225
00:16:21,79 --> 00:16:25,90
But for some reason that i
still kind of an led to me

226
00:16:25,90 --> 00:16:28,20
that i have to go around with
my brothers and sisters.

227
00:16:30,04 --> 00:16:32,30
I don't know what they're
going to do describe right

228
00:16:33,06 --> 00:16:37,80
but anyway it was it was a very lonely
several and a great deal of freedom.

229
00:16:37,80 --> 00:16:41,87
I thought as you know there wasn't a great
deal of freedom and there was no one.

230
00:16:42,48 --> 00:16:45,35
With them and the city
that you could talk to

231
00:16:47,15 --> 00:16:50,44
but i loved reading mostly like
reading who was your favorite author.

232
00:16:50,47 --> 00:16:56,10
I don't have any private all to bugger
up a true love story later here is my

233
00:16:56,10 --> 00:16:59,44
brother. Love story books but they used
to hide under the mattress or anywhere

234
00:16:59,44 --> 00:17:04,27
and i guarantee you know the right man
and i didn't find it so that was all

235
00:17:04,27 --> 00:17:08,39
that i read actually hear a clip from
school or take books from the library

236
00:17:08,39 --> 00:17:15,06
and very now you mention
something about a band slide

237
00:17:15,06 --> 00:17:19,30
earlier. Can you remember i came later

238
00:17:20,10 --> 00:17:26,27
that came later after we were
married about five probably started

239
00:17:27,37 --> 00:17:31,35
a few years early demand
if i go by no place and.

240
00:17:32,06 --> 00:17:34,47
Well after we were married
you have to ask me about me.

241
00:17:34,47 --> 00:17:39,60
Wedding after new and i can married we
want to leave a job. Would you can.

242
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:43,85
And i have been an apartment
had planted bananas there

243
00:17:45,24 --> 00:17:48,82
and i got a lease which everyone
had to do that they meant.

244
00:17:50,06 --> 00:17:54,63
The land and i got the least grown
up five years with a 10 year option.

245
00:17:56,57 --> 00:17:59,79
I mean the meantime we got married and.

246
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,92
Five years were up so they went
into the lawyer and said you know

247
00:18:04,92 --> 00:18:07,37
that they wanted to get the option to.

248
00:18:07,88 --> 00:18:11,17
For another 10 years and
then the lawyer told them

249
00:18:11,17 --> 00:18:13,56
but the owners of the land
had not signed the option.

250
00:18:14,40 --> 00:18:19,25
And i had no idea of this but i
thought they had a 15 year lease so

251
00:18:19,25 --> 00:18:25,09
that after five years they had to pull
the plan they get a claim i planned.

252
00:18:25,10 --> 00:18:31,56
The plantation and i really
you know run inside a name

253
00:18:31,56 --> 00:18:34,75
but i am still very bitter about it.

254
00:18:35,69 --> 00:18:40,29
Because here the young man and the views
were starting out working very hard

255
00:18:41,76 --> 00:18:43,16
and i didn't sign that option.

256
00:18:43,36 --> 00:18:47,77
None purpose and i might just go after

257
00:18:47,77 --> 00:18:53,34
that i believe the law was brought
in that they could not put your.

258
00:18:53,73 --> 00:18:57,30
Good property unless they boarded
and gave you some compensation

259
00:18:58,28 --> 00:19:04,64
but we didn't we had to leave and
it was a lot of work and i'm top of

260
00:19:04,64 --> 00:19:07,14
that in the very heart of
the family name to ramp.

261
00:19:07,24 --> 00:19:12,02
How many acres were involved in that we
had many and i guess 10 acres of bananas

262
00:19:12,02 --> 00:19:17,80
or two culpability is no doubt
with the magic being here.

263
00:19:17,98 --> 00:19:20,76
It's not a general bug.

264
00:19:21,78 --> 00:19:26,33
And in the meantime we had
to find somewhere else but

265
00:19:27,50 --> 00:19:31,39
that wasn't very bad was the worst part
but also we have to ship the house.

266
00:19:31,45 --> 00:19:38,41
Now this has had already been shifted
once it belong to the sawmill as she

267
00:19:38,42 --> 00:19:41,70
got and i had been his uncle

268
00:19:41,70 --> 00:19:47,96
and other friends say that if i were in
the house is taken down by the board.

269
00:19:49,22 --> 00:19:52,89
I demolished a dorm where.

270
00:19:52,91 --> 00:19:58,70
Transported they train you know the things
you know they talk and board by board.

271
00:19:59,29 --> 00:20:03,74
Yes. And we built it and rebuilt it
not actually demolish you know that.

272
00:20:04,89 --> 00:20:08,34
Anyway that's what happened. I
took it all down and rebuilt it.

273
00:20:09,34 --> 00:20:10,64
Where we were couldn't make.

274
00:20:10,75 --> 00:20:15,24
So when you were on the original 10 acres
there would be but not developed at all.

275
00:20:15,30 --> 00:20:17,94
There was no no no no no no no.

276
00:20:17,95 --> 00:20:20,44
You know none of the
banana growers had them

277
00:20:20,44 --> 00:20:22,30
and they had to build their own houses and

278
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:26,15
that this would particularly nice
because it belonged to the soil millers

279
00:20:26,15 --> 00:20:30,86
and it was also a line inside in our
feelings which was rather rare in those

280
00:20:30,86 --> 00:20:34,69
behaviors and libya had
painted a very nice

281
00:20:35,66 --> 00:20:41,68
but after about three years i think it was
a nation three years it had to be done

282
00:20:41,68 --> 00:20:45,71
all over again and eventually with it

283
00:20:45,71 --> 00:20:51,16
and least some land i know mr. noble
objective which wasn't very far from where i

284
00:20:51,16 --> 00:20:56,16
was before i was married daughter
actually went to the same school as i did

285
00:20:58,20 --> 00:21:00,95
what was done and when
they were taking it down.

286
00:21:01,12 --> 00:21:04,51
I might there be more in every room so

287
00:21:04,51 --> 00:21:08,44
that the same boards would go in the
same position and i would put up again.

288
00:21:09,71 --> 00:21:11,52
And they did but always with help a friend

289
00:21:12,75 --> 00:21:18,93
and an uncle jack parent who had who
was a big help. So he did you move.

290
00:21:19,63 --> 00:21:26,04
From one land to the next with
a parent or was there a time

291
00:21:26,04 --> 00:21:31,29
that you know we had to land somewhere to
go straight away and we tried we tried

292
00:21:31,29 --> 00:21:38,19
and tried because i think my dad had a few
months for the nana's so we had tried to

293
00:21:38,20 --> 00:21:39,63
find land and that's where we found

294
00:21:39,63 --> 00:21:42,07
that it was very hard because
it was just after the war

295
00:21:43,50 --> 00:21:49,86
and a lot of people still didn't feel
too kindly to return to war to tell you

296
00:21:49,86 --> 00:21:53,99
mr. noble of the peaceful name do you
remember i think it was rain over

297
00:21:53,99 --> 00:21:59,85
and he came from. He was from dubai.
Yes but dubai where we put a grain.

298
00:22:01,43 --> 00:22:06,49
So there was a lovely little stuff that
wasn't in our land but we had rented

299
00:22:06,49 --> 00:22:09,60
that we would have loved
to build a house on.

300
00:22:09,62 --> 00:22:15,44
But he said no he loved us to build it
where we were paying rent for so there was

301
00:22:15,44 --> 00:22:16,40
nothing else we could do

302
00:22:18,09 --> 00:22:24,92
but we put it up there in the meantime we
were living in a tent part of the time

303
00:22:24,92 --> 00:22:28,41
part of the time we started
with libya as an aunty.

304
00:22:30,43 --> 00:22:34,91
So it means really didn't get put up
a grain and we don't have children

305
00:22:34,91 --> 00:22:40,90
and stay here seven you know a little
very hard for a little girl she was two

306
00:22:42,91 --> 00:22:46,26
we did but the house that
got it going painted it.

307
00:22:47,25 --> 00:22:53,61
We planted some bananas.
Yeah but with after.

308
00:22:56,08 --> 00:22:59,00
My husband had come
down from where he was.

309
00:22:59,68 --> 00:23:03,38
We were before and we have to
play a little bit of blame

310
00:23:04,30 --> 00:23:07,42
but then there was more land to
play and i can remember the day

311
00:23:07,42 --> 00:23:09,90
that he started i was the
one that drove the horses

312
00:23:09,90 --> 00:23:14,16
and it was a little bit of a hill and
horses were frisky but hadn't been used.

313
00:23:16,00 --> 00:23:19,12
So i was the one that had to drive them
on the particular violet he wanted

314
00:23:19,12 --> 00:23:23,78
but my daughter to you. Our
daughter had a higher temperature.

315
00:23:23,79 --> 00:23:25,13
I didn't have a moment of it.

316
00:23:25,15 --> 00:23:29,66
It doesn't take a mother doesn't need a
moment to know temperatures so we can run

317
00:23:29,66 --> 00:23:33,49
it. We're going to do if we haven't
had in this land need to be played.

318
00:23:34,93 --> 00:23:36,30
Because you never know
when it's going to rain.

319
00:23:36,51 --> 00:23:40,14
You never know what the weather's
going to do but i'm not around.

320
00:23:40,38 --> 00:23:43,90
Very well and and for.

321
00:23:44,79 --> 00:23:50,33
It's towards the wind and put in the
ground and i've gone sea area every now

322
00:23:50,33 --> 00:23:53,26
and then they have you know going
for you had to help live you know.

323
00:23:53,41 --> 00:23:59,55
So yeah i drove the horses and
he had to play and growing.

324
00:24:01,79 --> 00:24:05,18
Really part because everyone take
pills and you can't handle the player

325
00:24:05,18 --> 00:24:09,46
and the horses he was it's
very hard for one person.

326
00:24:10,02 --> 00:24:13,24
So we planned it and we
got the bananas planted.

327
00:24:14,84 --> 00:24:15,25
And

328
00:24:15,25 --> 00:24:20,57
that would have been about six months
nine months i just forget now writer

329
00:24:21,83 --> 00:24:27,43
that we have cyclone. We used
to have very mixed cyclones and

330
00:24:27,43 --> 00:24:30,87
that is by we haven't seen
any individual anything like

331
00:24:30,87 --> 00:24:35,42
that for a long long time i jes but
we get the side lines from the north

332
00:24:36,88 --> 00:24:40,18
and the wind would blow it would
play havoc with the bananas.

333
00:24:40,69 --> 00:24:45,27
But we sat there with my marrying maps
because the nannies remixed so they couldn't

334
00:24:45,27 --> 00:24:51,31
a lot of damage to them. And it was
early afternoon and we would love.

335
00:24:52,00 --> 00:24:57,30
It was simply having a lot of
rain was pelting down and down

336
00:24:57,30 --> 00:25:00,60
and down towards the river and you
could see your brother. I think.

337
00:25:02,09 --> 00:25:03,87
And there was a family. There is a family.

338
00:25:04,19 --> 00:25:09,02
He would laugh aloud in the house you
know all around he running along coming

339
00:25:09,02 --> 00:25:09,70
but you know.

340
00:25:10,07 --> 00:25:14,40
He couldn't have these cars because you
couldn't get any of the better revival.

341
00:25:15,37 --> 00:25:19,88
But hunch towards the wind
and then we went inside

342
00:25:20,83 --> 00:25:22,56
and we dry we had a cup of coffee. It was.

343
00:25:22,86 --> 00:25:26,77
Labor three o'clock and as
we would making this coffee.

344
00:25:26,83 --> 00:25:32,85
We heard a small thump in the
back of the house and what was

345
00:25:32,85 --> 00:25:37,64
that but we went to the miserly looked out

346
00:25:37,64 --> 00:25:42,04
and we saw some of the landslide
had looked he was about

347
00:25:44,52 --> 00:25:47,28
200 yards up a something
in this club steep hill.

348
00:25:48,89 --> 00:25:50,56
So then with what are we going to do.

349
00:25:50,79 --> 00:25:55,87
Suddenly he said we can't be staying here
he said we'll have to get out so he raced

350
00:25:55,87 --> 00:25:59,77
down under the house and he got the
utility me had a fire utility.

351
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,32
No you've got it out and put it on a ride
and i talked a few things in the bag

352
00:26:06,21 --> 00:26:09,90
and he came back in and me picked
up and shut the doors to me

353
00:26:10,96 --> 00:26:15,69
and just as we were put on the rambam
the biggest landslide came down

354
00:26:16,62 --> 00:26:19,78
and rob just the house.
It just made on it.

355
00:26:21,50 --> 00:26:25,17
And nobody's anything we
just went even thinking

356
00:26:26,06 --> 00:26:29,72
and run in front of me one of the
miranda powers just come up to scratch

357
00:26:29,72 --> 00:26:34,60
and kinda mean i could and
a half eventually settled.

358
00:26:34,62 --> 00:26:39,11
It didn't go right on the ground because
we had a few 40 gallon runs underneath.

359
00:26:39,42 --> 00:26:44,54
So we didn't go right to the
ground but what had been a 10

360
00:26:44,54 --> 00:26:48,76
or 12 stop have we not
stopped down into the mud.

361
00:26:49,91 --> 00:26:54,03
So we got and we just got out would not
be looking fine thing we just went

362
00:26:55,51 --> 00:26:58,38
and i looked back and i saw my
have that i really loved and

363
00:26:58,38 --> 00:27:02,19
that would work so they
were sitting in the mud.

364
00:27:03,65 --> 00:27:08,58
But we read any rain we went over to an
uncle's place put need of millinery farai.

365
00:27:08,82 --> 00:27:11,80
His uncle jack and we
stayed there for the night.

366
00:27:11,90 --> 00:27:17,33
Next morning the cyclone was over.
It's finished. The sun was shining.

367
00:27:18,67 --> 00:27:20,10
So whip up up and we went to law

368
00:27:21,09 --> 00:27:26,14
and we should take the father
of a poor boy to live here

369
00:27:26,14 --> 00:27:30,13
and i think before it happened actually
settled right down the southern side

370
00:27:30,13 --> 00:27:35,04
and the only damage inside was a few
bits of broken couple of modelling lying

371
00:27:35,04 --> 00:27:41,80
around and my wardrobe a problem and
under the bed but had been scratched

372
00:27:41,80 --> 00:27:46,09
or dented anyway. So what to do now.

373
00:27:48,61 --> 00:27:53,81
No good. Jack came again with
the idea of sawing it into.

374
00:27:53,83 --> 00:27:56,55
And he knew somebody at
least to him sent from him

375
00:27:56,55 --> 00:28:01,65
and he knew he had done this before
so this time. Actually saw him too.

376
00:28:01,78 --> 00:28:07,45
I think but the peanut butter is
sorted in two and took it over

377
00:28:07,45 --> 00:28:14,45
and put it on blocks where we have usually
had nodded to me. And once again.

378
00:28:14,76 --> 00:28:18,52
I remember it was winter because
we were living in a tent

379
00:28:19,27 --> 00:28:22,54
and i think members level and going out
and trying in the morning our hands

380
00:28:22,54 --> 00:28:27,81
and the frost on the ground to stay right
in the open because i had to cook for the

381
00:28:27,81 --> 00:28:33,74
men so they had to be a stay there and
we sorted up again in the septic tank

382
00:28:33,74 --> 00:28:35,05
but not.

383
00:28:35,42 --> 00:28:42,22
After all it's raining raining for a long
time so we had never come so used to go

384
00:28:42,22 --> 00:28:43,93
and wash in a little creek

385
00:28:43,93 --> 00:28:49,66
that wasn't very far right we got from this
creek it was all kind of a bit of a you

386
00:28:49,67 --> 00:28:50,95
know i love wedding ring.

387
00:28:50,95 --> 00:28:54,25
I love this time best
i've got there it seems

388
00:28:54,25 --> 00:28:59,03
and the dystopian water on the stimulus
lasted a look for an in a family band.

389
00:29:01,03 --> 00:29:03,67
And so we just write and tell the brain.

390
00:29:05,41 --> 00:29:08,71
There was no buying water in those
days of course you know i know.

391
00:29:08,77 --> 00:29:13,94
Anyway you couldn't face it if you
had he would have thought about it

392
00:29:13,94 --> 00:29:17,10
but decided we have 9000 gallons tank

393
00:29:17,87 --> 00:29:21,75
and the tank had to last
year for everything so that

394
00:29:21,75 --> 00:29:26,30
when it got down to the last time we
used to call the last time it was black.

395
00:29:26,30 --> 00:29:30,45
It was night out about nine of the same as
the roof which would've been about three

396
00:29:30,45 --> 00:29:35,62
feet. It wasn't used for the washing
of bats or anything anymore.

397
00:29:36,09 --> 00:29:38,08
It had to be used just for the kitchen

398
00:29:38,08 --> 00:29:41,54
and had some border had to be
carted with runs somewhere else.

399
00:29:42,99 --> 00:29:47,72
So where would you close. The vault.

400
00:29:47,74 --> 00:29:50,01
Jaeger it wasn't very far away at all.

401
00:29:50,19 --> 00:29:56,10
It was only a couple hundred yards or
something. This little creek when it rose.

402
00:29:57,68 --> 00:29:59,89
But it was in such a position
that we couldn't get to them.

403
00:30:01,72 --> 00:30:05,39
So just move on and.

404
00:30:06,04 --> 00:30:09,43
We went on and on and
were planted in the night

405
00:30:09,43 --> 00:30:16,20
and not long after we had got

406
00:30:16,21 --> 00:30:22,43
the game runs up to bananas was
too low and it got frosted.

407
00:30:22,45 --> 00:30:26,51
So those that work for
nothing in the name.

408
00:30:26,53 --> 00:30:32,83
I'm sure the bananas didn't get but they
would be airing. And it was love job.

409
00:30:33,14 --> 00:30:34,98
To take the bananas in with the slide.

410
00:30:36,31 --> 00:30:39,24
And we have two horses because you
need to force the stop lying.

411
00:30:39,47 --> 00:30:41,03
So one was a required fella

412
00:30:41,03 --> 00:30:45,71
but one by my husband thought he became
the other one lesson. A bit of exercise.

413
00:30:46,14 --> 00:30:47,56
So he put her around the slide.

414
00:30:48,69 --> 00:30:52,57
So i went with the side he was
cutting and putting them on the road

415
00:30:53,47 --> 00:30:59,93
and i was loading. Something that's a
skill that. I don't know. And it took.

416
00:31:01,44 --> 00:31:08,40
And it went through the banana slug going
to pieces in the butt then stop them

417
00:31:08,40 --> 00:31:13,06
at the shed window and they were all
of it in the shape of the mileage

418
00:31:13,06 --> 00:31:17,36
but if any have tried it but
it would be hard to break.

419
00:31:18,89 --> 00:31:25,64
So then we have to go on the fly from
somewhere to get to him it was very hard

420
00:31:28,36 --> 00:31:30,73
in the meantime of course
when we looked georgie boy

421
00:31:31,94 --> 00:31:34,15
and we were all expenses about half a game

422
00:31:34,15 --> 00:31:38,09
and the bubble expensive game to make
a bit of money we planned and beans.

423
00:31:38,67 --> 00:31:42,29
In between the bananas which everybody did
actually because of the nana's running

424
00:31:42,29 --> 00:31:46,50
smells of the brambles already can't
allow it so we planed being there

425
00:31:46,50 --> 00:31:48,05
and get a little bit
of money to carry one.

426
00:31:49,63 --> 00:31:54,83
But many of the time unless we had to
borrow some money to keep going keep going.

427
00:31:55,21 --> 00:31:58,63
And of course when you borrow
you have to pay it back.

428
00:32:01,30 --> 00:32:02,31
That was my militantly.
