1
00:00:01,57 --> 00:00:08,16
Yes. Now you don't need to say that so i'll
start again. Never. If you don't worry

2
00:00:08,16 --> 00:00:10,70
about it. I'm talking to mr.

3
00:00:10,70 --> 00:00:13,87
Jack macrae who worked on the
sydney harbour bridge as

4
00:00:13,87 --> 00:00:20,45
a concrete. Will you tell us about
those years. Mr macrae yes. I

5
00:00:20,45 --> 00:00:26,92
arrived in sydney in april
1927 and immediately i

6
00:00:27,63 --> 00:00:33,56
hit sydney that day and made my way down
to the harbor. And with the intention of

7
00:00:33,56 --> 00:00:40,43
finding out where the harbor
bridge site was. And this was done

8
00:00:40,43 --> 00:00:47,19
by medium of the tram down during the
street. And when i got down to do us

9
00:00:47,19 --> 00:00:49,64
a point there was certainly

10
00:00:49,64 --> 00:00:55,60
a great deal of activity going on there.
One of the first things i did was to

11
00:00:55,60 --> 00:01:02,14
interview the foreman.
Doors print with the

12
00:01:02,14 --> 00:01:08,23
intention of getting employment. Do
you members name do you. Yes it was.

13
00:01:08,48 --> 00:01:15,26
The foreman's name the general foreman
whose correct total it was was

14
00:01:15,26 --> 00:01:22,19
mr harry sinclair. And i asked him for
employment and he said to me. Can you climb

15
00:01:22,19 --> 00:01:28,82
. You know i said yes and
soon after that he said to me

16
00:01:29,65 --> 00:01:34,24
you can start tomorrow morning
and what did you get first

17
00:01:34,24 --> 00:01:40,77
a matter of fact i got the job that
i was on for five years. Packing

18
00:01:40,77 --> 00:01:44,33
concrete exactly what does the job of pack

19
00:01:44,33 --> 00:01:48,80
a cockpit how did you go about
it. Well packing terror is

20
00:01:48,80 --> 00:01:53,61
a piece of steel about five eighths
of an inch diameter with a spade like

21
00:01:53,61 --> 00:01:59,15
a small spade like part on
one end of it and a ring for

22
00:01:59,15 --> 00:02:06,13
a handle on the other and this was to
to agitate concrete and to make sure

23
00:02:06,13 --> 00:02:11,41
that when the when the forms
etc were stripped that

24
00:02:11,41 --> 00:02:15,93
a good finish was obtained so that
takes the place of what is now

25
00:02:15,93 --> 00:02:19,33
a vibrator. Yes that is so
that takes the place of

26
00:02:19,33 --> 00:02:23,54
a vibrate. So you were ramming the concrete
down all the time into their mind does

27
00:02:23,54 --> 00:02:30,15
that's an awful lot of concrete. That is
so you do you member any incidents that

28
00:02:30,15 --> 00:02:34,25
happened while you were working down there.
Did you start with the foundations in

29
00:02:34,25 --> 00:02:41,16
the first place. When i arrived there
you know probable 1927 the pilings were

30
00:02:41,16 --> 00:02:46,91
about twenty five to thirty feet in height
from the ground. So the foundations had

31
00:02:46,91 --> 00:02:50,69
been built had skew backs as they used to
call them have been built and they were

32
00:02:50,69 --> 00:02:56,62
up so far and you end up from there with
them. That is so what about the the

33
00:02:56,63 --> 00:03:02,89
placing of the of the granite how did
they do that with the country. Well each

34
00:03:02,90 --> 00:03:08,85
course of granite was of course
numbered and was placed in position by

35
00:03:09,96 --> 00:03:13,49
a stone mason who was assisted
by a laborer and also

36
00:03:13,49 --> 00:03:20,02
a dogman the. The granite blocks
were hoisted into position by

37
00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:26,87
a seven ton crane on each
pylon and after after the

38
00:03:28,04 --> 00:03:34,90
the the stones granite themselves
were laid the concrete was

39
00:03:34,90 --> 00:03:41,17
filled in behind. And of course behind
that again was the concrete pile in it. So

40
00:03:42,69 --> 00:03:46,36
yes i understand. Well i understand there
at one stage they ran out of stones and

41
00:03:46,36 --> 00:03:52,81
had to carry on with the concreting i don't
remember that. And do you remember any

42
00:03:52,81 --> 00:03:59,64
. Any accidents or any tragic incidents.
Here so can the first accident that i

43
00:03:59,64 --> 00:04:02,97
remember was in nineteen
twenty seven or twenty eight

44
00:04:04,68 --> 00:04:09,29
a chap but the name of tom the key and was
killed on the doors point side between

45
00:04:09,29 --> 00:04:16,12
the pile and the next pier.
Unfortunately here he was

46
00:04:16,12 --> 00:04:16,44
on

47
00:04:16,44 --> 00:04:23,77
a scaffold and the chain
operating this block became

48
00:04:23,77 --> 00:04:30,28
entangled in his leg and and
the scaffolding capsized and

49
00:04:30,28 --> 00:04:36,71
tom was was falling falling to the ground.

50
00:04:38,29 --> 00:04:39,68
I went out to his funeral with

51
00:04:39,68 --> 00:04:46,44
a lot more at botany
cemetery that. Another near

52
00:04:46,44 --> 00:04:53,23
another and near accident was around
about 1930 dogman but the name of percy

53
00:04:53,23 --> 00:04:58,72
young was riding one of these pieces of
granite up very high about 200 feet i

54
00:04:58,72 --> 00:05:05,31
should say off the ground when the
crane driver and the man himself.

55
00:05:06,13 --> 00:05:07,83
Happened to have

56
00:05:07,84 --> 00:05:15,09
a lapse and the. The chain the chain.

57
00:05:15,10 --> 00:05:21,42
I'm sorry i'm getting
on next to the. About

58
00:05:21,42 --> 00:05:28,17
200 feet. The train driver had misread the

59
00:05:29,08 --> 00:05:35,46
the mark on his cable and the the

60
00:05:36,32 --> 00:05:43,10
of the block on the crane was pulled
through the geneva wheel at the top of

61
00:05:43,10 --> 00:05:49,65
the tube and the. Dogman percy young

62
00:05:50,70 --> 00:05:55,46
was left hanging there with his elbow only

63
00:05:55,47 --> 00:05:59,15
a few inches from through being dragged
from being dragged through this journey

64
00:05:59,15 --> 00:06:05,50
where all the piece of granite that he was
standing on crashed to the ground and he

65
00:06:05,50 --> 00:06:11,32
was left there dangling in
mid-air. The driver got such

66
00:06:11,32 --> 00:06:18,14
a shock that he immediately went and gave
in his notice. Do you know what his name

67
00:06:18,14 --> 00:06:23,96
was no i can't remember the crane driver's
name. He was driving the well and the

68
00:06:23,96 --> 00:06:30,89
twenty five ton crane that. The
alarm was raised. Of course and

69
00:06:32,10 --> 00:06:38,07
very very soon riggers came to the rescue
and another train driver came along

70
00:06:39,49 --> 00:06:45,22
and move the train job over to where this
man could be landed in safety. Yes it's

71
00:06:45,22 --> 00:06:50,27
a nasty incident to anything happen to you
any incidents that happened to you. The

72
00:06:50,28 --> 00:06:52,92
only thing that happened to me was i got

73
00:06:52,92 --> 00:06:58,95
a blow on the head. Rivet fell on
my head and. That was around about

74
00:06:58,95 --> 00:07:05,47
1931. And i remember going chap
took me up to sydney hospital and

75
00:07:05,48 --> 00:07:12,29
five stitches were put into my head. There's
no safety helmets in those days. No

76
00:07:12,29 --> 00:07:14,45
everybody wore either

77
00:07:14,46 --> 00:07:21,43
a cap or so soft hat. Yes. Do you remember
any amusing instance when you when

78
00:07:21,43 --> 00:07:28,12
you working on the bridge.
Well one. One when

79
00:07:28,95 --> 00:07:34,50

together and this concrete taking it was

80
00:07:34,50 --> 00:07:40,39

and a chap called jeremy aziz who was

81
00:07:40,39 --> 00:07:46,80

82
00:07:47,56 --> 00:07:51,82

a bubble off my tongue.

lunch at the foundations. Here
so i can remember the lunch

87
00:08:13,46 --> 00:08:19,06

six minutes to twelve and resume

88
00:08:19,06 --> 00:08:25,89

Did your sit down being too tired or did

96
00:09:03,27 --> 00:09:10,20
people used to skylight youngsters used
to skylark to know when in fact the

97
00:09:10,95 --> 00:09:11,33
we had

98
00:09:11,33 --> 00:09:18,79
a change. Room and doors point where you
could sit down and in no days the conditions

99
00:09:18,80 --> 00:09:21,88
were somewhat trimeter for us
far as making tea. There was

100
00:09:21,88 --> 00:09:28,39
a big cup full of boiling water ready
for team making but afterwards as soon

101
00:09:29,24 --> 00:09:35,40
soon as the lunch was eaten genuine
cards were played for money.

102
00:09:36,70 --> 00:09:43,03
Generally small stakes for poker and no
crown anchor of that side oh no no. Crown

103
00:09:43,03 --> 00:09:49,84
and anchor where we were only
only the cards. Yes ever in the

104
00:09:49,84 --> 00:09:55,33
workshop they supply crown anchor if they
only didn't know about. When you're at do

105
00:09:55,33 --> 00:09:58,97
it's point you're the first person i've
interviewed who who knows what. Well what

106
00:09:58,97 --> 00:10:02,49

carpenters workshop. Yes i do remember

109
00:10:13,75 --> 00:10:19,78
also the other carpenters there were about
six in number and they like myself saw

110
00:10:19,78 --> 00:10:25,98
the whole job through. So you started
in in what year was it 1927 i started

111
00:10:27,17 --> 00:10:33,38
that was very early yet. And you finished.
What do you nineteen. Thirty two. Yes.

112
00:10:33,41 --> 00:10:37,16
Thirty two. But you you finished
up before the bridge was finished

113
00:10:38,14 --> 00:10:42,71
a fortnight before. Do you remember
anything else about the working conditions

114
00:10:42,71 --> 00:10:48,22
around those point. Yes i do remember the
working conditions around ground about

115
00:10:48,22 --> 00:10:54,10
doors point. We we had in my case

116
00:10:55,44 --> 00:10:57,96
we were successful in
getting when we got up

117
00:10:57,96 --> 00:11:03,21
a certain height which i think was
over fifty feet. We were successful in

118
00:11:03,21 --> 00:11:08,50
approaching the management and we were
three of us were allowed ten minutes

119
00:11:09,91 --> 00:11:13,35
changing time or cleaning
time and this was

120
00:11:13,35 --> 00:11:20,01
a ten minutes to five ten to minister five
every day. Did you after you finish the

121
00:11:20,01 --> 00:11:25,74
pylon did you go on the deck or not.
No i didn't go on any further work. No

122
00:11:25,74 --> 00:11:31,83
concreting. And that 1932
and you were laid off

123
00:11:32,87 --> 00:11:36,39
. Do you remember the opening of the bridge
or yes i remember the opening very well

124
00:11:36,39 --> 00:11:40,49
. And i was up and york street with my wife
hadn't been married very long and then

125
00:11:41,30 --> 00:11:47,66
and we we were up in new york
street and i was some half

126
00:11:47,66 --> 00:11:53,28
a mile. I suppose from the actual ceremonies
at that. So you know you were you

127
00:11:53,28 --> 00:12:00,04
couldn't get anywhere near the actual
ceremony. Well no i wasn't i would say hours

128
00:12:00,04 --> 00:12:04,57
down the scotch church or somewhere down
the part of york street. Did you walk over

129
00:12:04,57 --> 00:12:09,07
the bridge after it was over. Yeah. Yes i
walked over over the bridge after it was

130
00:12:09,07 --> 00:12:10,02
a month

131
00:12:10,02 --> 00:12:16,16
a great crowd that was there that day and
do you were out of work then yes i was

132
00:12:16,16 --> 00:12:21,04
out of work after after that. Yes. For some
considerable time. Do you get the dole

133
00:12:21,04 --> 00:12:27,63
. Yes i did eventually but you mean
eventually. Oh that would be about six months

134
00:12:27,63 --> 00:12:32,74
after the opening after i became out of
work. Why didn't you get the dole for six

135
00:12:32,74 --> 00:12:34,02
months. Well i had

136
00:12:34,02 --> 00:12:38,51
a little bit of money in the bank and in
those days the state government and the

137
00:12:38,51 --> 00:12:43,23
people that control the social services
made sure that you had to use up all your

138
00:12:43,23 --> 00:12:49,38
own money first before you could be become
an eligible for any assistance. What

139
00:12:49,38 --> 00:12:51,14
about you if you had any assets if you had

140
00:12:51,14 --> 00:12:55,95
a house to what about that. Well i you
know in those days i didn't say in any

141
00:12:55,95 --> 00:13:02,43
properties so but i know very well the
people that did they had to sell their

142
00:13:02,43 --> 00:13:08,73
houses first before they could get anything
or furniture to get in the thing. And

143
00:13:08,73 --> 00:13:12,59
the assistance from the state government
when you got the dole did you get coupons

144
00:13:12,59 --> 00:13:15,75
or was it rations or what it was

145
00:13:15,75 --> 00:13:22,19
a coupon and in this case it amounted
to nine shillings california tonight.

146
00:13:23,82 --> 00:13:27,50
And what about cooking money did you get
anything for the meter. No we didn't get

147
00:13:27,50 --> 00:13:31,93
anything like that. You know some people
reckon that they got five shillings for

148
00:13:31,93 --> 00:13:36,39
the meat i suppose that was married with
children. Ah well that's something that i

149
00:13:36,39 --> 00:13:43,30
don't know really. And how do
you pay the rent. Well i had to

150
00:13:43,30 --> 00:13:47,78
put on some different things that i had
from time to time and that was the way that

151
00:13:47,78 --> 00:13:54,17
i managed to pay the rent of the del
inspector steer. Yes i remember dale and

152
00:13:54,17 --> 00:14:00,73
spectres but i never met any of them
personally and there never had cause to have

153
00:14:00,73 --> 00:14:06,09
a go at you know. Naturally i was

154
00:14:06,09 --> 00:14:11,44
a delicate for that one of the unions at
the bridge and that made me very. Class

155
00:14:11,44 --> 00:14:17,61
conscious and no. Could you tell us about
union meetings to about the unionism on

156
00:14:17,61 --> 00:14:19,21
the bridge. Yes there was

157
00:14:19,99 --> 00:14:26,58
a good union feeling amongst the people
that i mean that i represented and. We

158
00:14:27,41 --> 00:14:29,87
which union was that was
that the w this was the

159
00:14:29,87 --> 00:14:35,18
a stallion worker's union yes. And at that
time of course they weren't affiliated

160
00:14:35,18 --> 00:14:41,50
with the trades and labour council and we
had to that is the other delegates and

161
00:14:41,50 --> 00:14:44,14
myself we had to do
things of our own bout to

162
00:14:44,14 --> 00:14:50,87
a great extent. And at the same
time we. I did have to approach the

163
00:14:50,88 --> 00:14:57,22
management on one occasion when one of
our chaps. Allegedly victimized and

164
00:14:59,36 --> 00:15:06,18
after taking three fellow workers and
also the secretary of the union. We

165
00:15:06,19 --> 00:15:06,79
interviewed mr.

166
00:15:06,79 --> 00:15:13,17
Martin and we were successful in getting
this. Work at reinstated and i had

167
00:15:13,17 --> 00:15:16,88
a very good relationship with mr.

168
00:15:16,88 --> 00:15:23,14
James knew who was the works of the field
manager and often after five o'clock of

169
00:15:23,14 --> 00:15:29,94
a night time he would speak
with me and. He even used to

170
00:15:29,94 --> 00:15:35,76
revise me sometimes how to go about things.
You remember him personally. Do you did

171
00:15:35,76 --> 00:15:39,51
you meet him afterwards. Yes i
had a good relationship with mr.

172
00:15:39,51 --> 00:15:43,68
James muir and i could say that i was

173
00:15:43,68 --> 00:15:48,85
a personal friend of hers. So what with
the relations with him and the union that

174
00:15:48,85 --> 00:15:52,48
they were good with their doormen long and
the and the unions. Yes there was very

175
00:15:52,48 --> 00:15:58,78
little friction from our point of view
and i think the incident that i just

176
00:15:58,78 --> 00:16:03,98
mentioned was about the only serious one
that i had to approach the management

177
00:16:03,98 --> 00:16:09,18
about did you have anything to do with the
negotiations between the government. I

178
00:16:09,18 --> 00:16:10,08
understand that there was

179
00:16:10,08 --> 00:16:13,42
a rise and fall of wages contact so
consequently the government had to pay the

180
00:16:13,42 --> 00:16:17,69
extra if you was increases in pay. And when
the government labor government changed

181
00:16:17,69 --> 00:16:23,79
i remember from the records
that the government went back

182
00:16:24,69 --> 00:16:29,90
on the agreement but it already been made
at one stage. And there were arguments do

183
00:16:29,90 --> 00:16:36,14
you were you involved in that at all. No i
wasn't involved in any negotiations like

184
00:16:36,14 --> 00:16:42,06
that but i do remember the
time that you speak of but

185
00:16:47,08 --> 00:16:50,51
it went down to arbitration in melbourne.
I think yes i believe you're right that

186
00:16:50,51 --> 00:16:55,09
would be the federal arbitration court
of course i looked up the yes the

187
00:16:55,09 --> 00:16:59,69
arbitration court proceedings down in
melbourne in. Bradfield actually spoke on

188
00:16:59,69 --> 00:17:03,77
behalf against the government on behalf
of the men i was rather surprised to see

189
00:17:03,77 --> 00:17:10,37
there's nothing happened to him about
it. Well you were job delicate

190
00:17:11,21 --> 00:17:16,83
. You didn't get that far up in negotiations.
You know of the only time that i ever

191
00:17:16,83 --> 00:17:17,85
. I think

192
00:17:17,85 --> 00:17:24,54
a couple of times i went to this state
conciliation court when we were going. For

193
00:17:24,54 --> 00:17:31,39
increased height money and on two occasions
i think and also one time the dogman

194
00:17:31,39 --> 00:17:35,79
were after increases and i
went up to the state can

195
00:17:40,03 --> 00:17:45,71
do you member jim campbell. Yes i do
remember jim campbell and he also was

196
00:17:45,71 --> 00:17:51,31
a personal friend of mine who came
from liverpool in england and he was

197
00:17:51,31 --> 00:17:58,08
a leading regular there and he was in charge
of about eight to ten riggers. And he

198
00:17:58,09 --> 00:18:04,99
was also of course. In mr james knew
of confidence and off and jim used to

199
00:18:04,99 --> 00:18:07,45
relay information that mr.

200
00:18:07,46 --> 00:18:14,20
Muir made to me. And i can say that i had

201
00:18:14,20 --> 00:18:18,95
a fairly close relationship with
jim campbell. And unfortunately

202
00:18:20,61 --> 00:18:26,39
a few weeks before the bridges opened
he was accidentally killed and

203
00:18:27,36 --> 00:18:32,51
it was very sad to. First
such a fine man and he was

204
00:18:32,51 --> 00:18:39,16
a rugged type of individual himself to
be taken when the reach was just about

205
00:18:39,16 --> 00:18:45,33
due for completion you member what happened.
Yes i remember what happened. He was

206
00:18:45,33 --> 00:18:52,30

down the needles as they were called

207
00:18:52,30 --> 00:18:56,84

top of each pylon that had been used to

208
00:18:56,84 --> 00:19:02,92

209
00:19:02,92 --> 00:19:09,10

210
00:19:09,62 --> 00:19:15,72
Around at the top of the pile and

He intercepted. One of the steel standards
and then eventually for fell to the

00:19:39,54 --> 00:19:45,18
