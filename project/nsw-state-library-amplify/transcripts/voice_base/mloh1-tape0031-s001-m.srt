And now when i didn't know greece i

8
00:00:37,74 --> 00:00:44,69

like you know and you know actually to

9
00:00:44,69 --> 00:00:45,68
go after him. I didn't get

10
00:00:45,68 --> 00:00:50,02
a lot of what they were not so how did
you get the job on the other part of the

11
00:00:50,02 --> 00:00:56,86

is that it's just. Yeah i said economy

13
00:01:03,06 --> 00:01:06,19

every other guys would bring it on the

14
00:01:06,19 --> 00:01:13,04
bridge. So it's actually. Right. And

15
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:17,40
yet we can't give it passed and he said
look we set out and he said i'll take the

16
00:01:17,40 --> 00:01:19,91

for the concrete concrete and put in

22
00:01:50,72 --> 00:01:56,27
there but now for the men it was but no
stone masons. You know in australia in the

23
00:01:56,27 --> 00:02:02,91

when we were reckoned. So that be three
masons and three three labourers with it i

26
00:02:15,28 --> 00:02:20,71
think the labourers was a different
department yes but i think it was

27
00:02:20,71 --> 00:02:27,28
a stormy scotch tell us that there
were two members of the fallen so most

28
00:02:27,28 --> 00:02:32,90

on the on the opening of the have

30
00:02:36,98 --> 00:02:43,29
a ridge on the for the bridge workers might
have come but you know when the bridge

31
00:02:43,29 --> 00:02:46,00
of stop is again and he needs

32
00:02:46,70 --> 00:02:51,88
a little bundle at the funeral. Like

33
00:02:51,89 --> 00:02:58,46
a cross and they think that is buried
over and know them cemeteries. You know

34
00:02:59,26 --> 00:03:05,92

accident. He remembers how

35
00:03:05,92 --> 00:03:12,86
jimmy kimmel die do you. Yes yes i remember
that well you never forget we were

36
00:03:12,86 --> 00:03:17,45
stunned and we were going to work in the
guy ropes and jimmy was saying you know

37
00:03:17,45 --> 00:03:18,12
what you gave

38
00:03:18,12 --> 00:03:25,61
a direction which won it tight. What
was shipped and their power. So this

39
00:03:25,61 --> 00:03:30,82
is the polls that were carrying the staging
for the cleaners the pylon cleaners. As

40
00:03:32,06 --> 00:03:38,31
they pile in cleaners had finished. I'm
not part and we were taking the scarf on

41
00:03:38,31 --> 00:03:44,10
their own and and the outriggers
as well i don't know when

42
00:03:44,11 --> 00:03:49,69
a shift in the power you know we had
just kept it going as well you see

43
00:03:51,31 --> 00:03:56,71
this time he was saying you know
i listen so i mean you go ropes.

44
00:03:57,42 --> 00:04:02,34
Puffer when you come up and
shifted that pole just

45
00:04:02,35 --> 00:04:08,37
a german was struggling to get to the other
side through them up and down and down

46
00:04:09,15 --> 00:04:12,37
and alongside the pilot and
although we don't yet up

47
00:04:12,37 --> 00:04:18,75
a line in the pile and
that he don't think it.

48
00:04:20,85 --> 00:04:22,90
And his head hit the the lighting up

49
00:04:24,52 --> 00:04:29,37
a big part as it hit the lighting on the
way down to it. And yeah yeah yeah that

50
00:04:29,37 --> 00:04:35,49
knee injury was a big big star. You
know and then sleep was a part of

51
00:04:35,49 --> 00:04:41,79
a sleeper but about nine inches apart
that jimmy went right through there right

52
00:04:41,79 --> 00:04:46,81
through to the center of the pile and
down underneath that weren't there but

53
00:04:46,81 --> 00:04:53,20
everybody everybody and his
body was broken and. Then.

54
00:04:54,96 --> 00:05:00,62
The bridge was stop everyone bridge stop.
That route that blood be in and you know

55
00:05:00,62 --> 00:05:05,92
pile and he wanted volunteers to go and
bush and chairs that was what i think was

56
00:05:05,92 --> 00:05:12,33
left was the bush and yes they don't know
and so they're no book and i went over

57
00:05:12,33 --> 00:05:15,83
and bush i shared a room
in a bush and here it was

58
00:05:15,83 --> 00:05:22,11
a government or an apartment where the
blood was either way been there forever.

59
00:05:22,12 --> 00:05:28,16
Was older and think about it. And the

60
00:05:29,53 --> 00:05:34,17
joke like i said the procession of this
funeral that the yet at the funeral. I

61
00:05:34,17 --> 00:05:40,99
suppose we were but oh well over 200 out
of marched past the bridge. I mean i and

62
00:05:41,89 --> 00:05:47,30
passed through the piling it up. I suppose.
And it was led by the pope behind and

63
00:05:47,30 --> 00:05:49,74
he was pretty and he was

64
00:05:49,74 --> 00:05:56,50
a major major i thought that we. He was
older all the time but the pilings you know

65
00:05:57,89 --> 00:06:04,80
about. They went to the northern
cemeteries and that's right. It is i don't

66
00:06:04,80 --> 00:06:09,49
know whether we have done it. Relations out
or not. And this country but it didn't

67
00:06:09,49 --> 00:06:14,16
come from whatever you know do you member
any other accidents while you work you

68
00:06:15,98 --> 00:06:20,71
know the only other activity we had was
wonder why we're old and son issues you

69
00:06:20,71 --> 00:06:27,39
know forever and stop and you know the
thing was when we were daughter and. Just

70
00:06:27,39 --> 00:06:33,76
played and bought your nails and you know.
That's all that thing i could think of

71
00:06:35,39 --> 00:06:39,28
what were you doing before you.
You got on the bridge. I was

72
00:06:39,28 --> 00:06:44,94
a sleeper car in the bush column butting

73
00:06:44,94 --> 00:06:50,83
a political column but you know it's like
dempsey and. I really come down just for

74
00:06:51,61 --> 00:06:58,32
a trip to see that my other
brother. You know. Trust me i did

75
00:06:58,32 --> 00:07:02,27

84
00:07:48,04 --> 00:07:51,82

86
00:07:59,17 --> 00:08:05,38
Told our two brothers she crashed and
you know and i said to the bride i got

87
00:08:05,38 --> 00:08:10,57
a job i said i got the bridge.
I think you were there.

88
00:08:12,66 --> 00:08:14,46
You know she put on your bridge got such

89
00:08:14,46 --> 00:08:19,71
a because you just got
it. You got it. No need

90
00:08:19,71 --> 00:08:25,16
a job in the liberal free weekly are
either job to clean and on the pile and.

91
00:08:26,82 --> 00:08:29,58
When you finish cleaning the pylons were
you laid off or did you get further work.

92
00:08:29,70 --> 00:08:35,80
You know there was so that
everybody was led off i think what

93
00:08:37,06 --> 00:08:41,12
i was and the last ten it was but it
paid off. Well at the last one as

94
00:08:41,12 --> 00:08:47,56
a matter of fact. That before the bridge
was open or after that was before

95
00:08:47,57 --> 00:08:48,14
but

96
00:08:48,14 --> 00:08:54,61
a few days before the bridge or. We
were there on opening day. You get it

97
00:08:55,96 --> 00:09:02,45
right. We're going to see the
rest of the follow and they were

98
00:09:02,45 --> 00:09:09,20
celebrating the law. We didn't take it but
you know. And we we've got the bridge

99
00:09:09,20 --> 00:09:14,11
result that i walked across. I got no part

100
00:09:14,11 --> 00:09:18,69
a lot harder to come across as i said yes
that night. So you know it's such books

101
00:09:18,69 --> 00:09:23,37
as you said there are no i'm just going
to see something my mates and see you for

102
00:09:23,37 --> 00:09:26,14
the absolute but i think we already had

103
00:09:26,14 --> 00:09:32,89
a beat up you know. Nothing and
where did you get any work

104
00:09:32,89 --> 00:09:38,28
after the bridge straight away or not you
know you might have started i wouldn't go

105
00:09:38,28 --> 00:09:41,11
running. Well if you love

106
00:09:41,11 --> 00:09:48,00
a saved up. But i didn't last long
because everyone was there all. Sorry.

107
00:09:49,20 --> 00:09:51,52
Would you call and you get

108
00:09:51,52 --> 00:09:56,87
a cheap rate. You know that's got people
running what it was actually it was at

109
00:09:56,87 --> 00:10:02,49
like customers and some of the rolled up
like i said they couldn't buy you so what

110
00:10:02,49 --> 00:10:02,60
was

111
00:10:02,60 --> 00:10:10,97
a good ask you. Did you get on the
dole then. You know about the fact. I

112
00:10:10,98 --> 00:10:17,54
got job and i saw a hole and
so. I got a job down there as

113
00:10:17,54 --> 00:10:23,53
a man so that. Labor. You know the
labor up to the bottom because

114
00:10:27,54 --> 00:10:30,37
i was there for about twelve months
and that's what well i guess

115
00:10:30,37 --> 00:10:33,81
a beer bottle neck and i went and
told the boss. I think a job was

116
00:10:33,81 --> 00:10:39,65
a bomb maker. He said i said you've got
you've got the trade i said yeah i did say

117
00:10:39,65 --> 00:10:46,28
before you know i'm here but i said.
I lost it when i come up here.

118
00:10:46,46 --> 00:10:48,89
So. I said i might have played out

119
00:10:48,89 --> 00:10:53,48
a loss that when i got it. You know i mean
it wouldn't let me start again. So it's

120
00:10:53,48 --> 00:11:00,02
really 1921 and. So i got

121
00:11:00,88 --> 00:11:05,52
one don't think you know and i told them
the circumstances and of course that

122
00:11:06,29 --> 00:11:12,62
scotchman do not do that
and i do if they ask. Well

123
00:11:13,44 --> 00:11:18,72
where i worked and what we have for who
would support us isn't everything. Told

124
00:11:18,72 --> 00:11:24,71
them. Look we will send you word
give it. It's then i think and

125
00:11:26,15 --> 00:11:31,02
partner. Sent me word and i
could join the union. C.

126
00:11:31,02 --> 00:11:37,84
. So i told i invite and told them i was
and you know and i said. I've got over

127
00:11:37,84 --> 00:11:42,41
a garden and a job i said
i stop here and i get

128
00:11:42,41 --> 00:11:47,38
a job. I was there now holland's hour for

129
00:11:47,38 --> 00:11:54,30
a bit. I suppose they're from. But
free three years. They want to

130
00:11:54,30 --> 00:12:00,55
make their form and i

131
00:12:02,48 --> 00:12:06,99
said no i don't think so. And they're

132
00:12:06,99 --> 00:12:10,88
a brother in my you know he was here and
they had partners here come back for my

133
00:12:10,88 --> 00:12:17,58
one part and i told them i'd take them
off the furnace and they would say.

134
00:12:17,60 --> 00:12:23,53
You know i guess you could go under siege
garden and garden. I don't know you never

135
00:12:23,53 --> 00:12:27,79
remember. Well i'd like
you to tell us about god

136
00:12:31,53 --> 00:12:37,70
. That has the pride and she
had any funny stuff. You got

137
00:12:37,70 --> 00:12:38,91
a job. No war is

138
00:12:38,91 --> 00:12:44,73
a better best thing ever. You don't. Yeah.
You remember garden yourself do you.

139
00:12:44,79 --> 00:12:51,64
Yeah you know. He done
time he revealed and i

140
00:12:53,74 --> 00:12:53,83
was

141
00:12:53,83 --> 00:13:00,85
a good man. Yes i think you know
someone better like me because i wish

142
00:13:00,85 --> 00:13:07,34
to be too strong and i think
you know. Well there was

143
00:13:07,34 --> 00:13:12,18
a spurious rumour on the bridge and i'd
like you to lay it if you can. It was said

144
00:13:12,18 --> 00:13:15,68
freely around on the bridge that if there
was any trouble there was likely to be

145
00:13:15,68 --> 00:13:20,10
a strike or anything any lawrenson is the
flow and director of construction would

146
00:13:20,10 --> 00:13:25,49
run down to garden and get trying to get
him to fix it go. Well i wouldn't know

147
00:13:25,49 --> 00:13:32,16
about that like you know. But i think the
joke was. Don't think everything you know

148
00:13:32,16 --> 00:13:33,07
directly was

149
00:13:33,07 --> 00:13:39,05
a straight job that it be easier if i
want to know whether he was running.

150
00:13:40,32 --> 00:13:45,57
Because anyone could go in and get by
over and going to tell the public anger i

151
00:13:45,57 --> 00:13:48,23
guess because everyone
was just falling for

152
00:13:48,23 --> 00:13:54,40
a chance to get his bearings he was
straight myself but some of the engineers i

153
00:13:54,40 --> 00:14:01,40
reckon that he was the engineer. Well i
said what they were saying you know it was

154
00:14:01,40 --> 00:14:05,23
they said to me it was freely rumored
that he was in earnest pocket

155
00:14:09,71 --> 00:14:11,24
. But again that's

156
00:14:11,24 --> 00:14:14,66
a rumor you know they wouldn't say he was
they would say that you know the world is

157
00:14:14,66 --> 00:14:18,63
going around so i just just since you
since you know you think it's out of the

158
00:14:18,63 --> 00:14:25,59
question. Well you know. I don't know if
he's his life. You know i don't think

159
00:14:25,59 --> 00:14:30,08
it would be. I think if you get name right
where you get the same rumors what's

160
