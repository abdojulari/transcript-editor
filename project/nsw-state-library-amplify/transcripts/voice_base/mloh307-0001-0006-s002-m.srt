1
00:00:13,2 --> 00:00:14,1
This is side B.

2
00:00:14,1 --> 00:00:17,92
At Station six the tape continues in a few seconds

3
00:00:17,92 --> 00:00:35,34
and divide into for cation he was talking about the poverty of Bombay. You see my mother's father came from India.

4
00:00:36,9 --> 00:00:45,06
But he came from Darjeeling which was further in than in the north.

5
00:00:46,5 --> 00:00:57,75
That's the most something about there in Bombay in spite of this extreme poverty and. Distress. I was very distressed.

6
00:00:57,92 --> 00:01:09,4
I still felt you know were. That I belonged there. It was quite extraordinary. What can you say a bit more about.

7
00:01:12,16 --> 00:01:15,96
Was the time when I was very young I was twenty twenty one.

8
00:01:17,51 --> 00:01:26,33
And let my hair grow not bandit and people often thought that I was.

9
00:01:27,49 --> 00:01:38,67
Some thought a bad mother of a family that we never treasured it as we did our fathers for some bloody reason. But.

10
00:01:39,84 --> 00:01:50,85
I think we should have had to it's hard to describe the feeling I had when I was.

11
00:01:50,87 --> 00:02:05,04
I just thought it was my land to let alone. Well we had food there and the welcome was overwhelming.

12
00:02:06,33 --> 00:02:15,83
And I was very impressed with the trade you. You know who were with us. I would think long till I got Paddy.

13
00:02:17,35 --> 00:02:20,23
Some more prominent Labor party members in fact

14
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:36,56
and I was greatly moved by their tremendous understanding of the situation there. Plus the compassion. And.

15
00:02:38,37 --> 00:02:55,95
I found the members of the trade union in that delegation. Gave us great worth. This beautiful spirit.

16
00:02:55,97 --> 00:03:01,39
Beautiful People and well things I must do is make contact with them.

17
00:03:01,55 --> 00:03:05,5
There is one of the members of the trade union wrote to me recently.

18
00:03:07,31 --> 00:03:11,77
He's in Western Australia I'll look him up when I go. Anyhow.

19
00:03:12,2 --> 00:03:21,28
So we have had to get on with it back to the went up through work force the Suez Canal.

20
00:03:23,27 --> 00:03:34,49
It's port Port I hadn't missed it. Thanks. And we went ashore there. Went ashore at the other end.

21
00:03:36,14 --> 00:03:42,19
Anyhow it's sufficient that I say that because when I'm probably if ever I write the book I will check it out.

22
00:03:46,44 --> 00:03:54,78
If I want it now we're going through the Suez. I thought that was beautiful. I thought it was lovely.

23
00:04:00,89 --> 00:04:10,1
I thought it was just beautiful. And coming out in the morning and seeing really the banks with the date tree.

24
00:04:11,12 --> 00:04:22,23
This is so different somehow. And I have to remember to describe that in considerable detail. Because I left it.

25
00:04:22,25 --> 00:04:35,66
Just left. And we came out of it. And then the boat move rapidly. And we're on to you.

26
00:04:37,32 --> 00:04:41,67
I just want to say that as we were crossing the ocean from.

27
00:04:42,45 --> 00:04:51,23
To Naples one of delegates were sitting on the rail of the Packers a ship where many of the Main St

28
00:04:52,87 --> 00:05:09,61
and he was lost into the sea. Was lost. It was very sad terrible the boat. Searched for the body. Couldn't be found.

29
00:05:11,83 --> 00:05:21,67
So we went out and early one morning in the distance. Christophe was marked for serious.

30
00:05:22,56 --> 00:05:33,57
And I will always see the knife and and cruelly. I thought I don't want to see anything after.

31
00:05:34,8 --> 00:05:40,58
I just want to say that when I went back to Naples about a spray of Atlanta ten years ago with windy.

32
00:05:41,78 --> 00:05:55,71
You couldn't see anything so polluted so polluted but the by so beautiful. We were.

33
00:05:58,37 --> 00:06:08,67
And then we were told to leave ship there. And we would go by but we would just in our hotel.

34
00:06:08,68 --> 00:06:16,05
Then we would go back past. Up to Rome. Everyone thought this was great and I will never forget.

35
00:06:16,14 --> 00:06:22,28
Margaret Margaret Walker The costumes were not all finished when we had to get on the ship in Sydney.

36
00:06:22,75 --> 00:06:27,65
So learn be how old. Margaret Payne Margaret just said to John look I'll have to take the sewing machine.

37
00:06:28,21 --> 00:06:35,07
And the materials and so we had great sewing. And got the costumes.

38
00:06:35,09 --> 00:06:39,56
But I always remember sitting in the bus waiting for the last person to leave the boat

39
00:06:39,56 --> 00:06:45,08
and who should have been a moment when Margaret when John Kerry in the Singer sewing machine.

40
00:06:46,72 --> 00:06:52,85
So we got into the past and we were taken to our hotel. Now.

41
00:06:54,08 --> 00:07:04,6
Naples to me was just a city I felt where I could live and I could and I. And the warmth of the people.

42
00:07:06,52 --> 00:07:23,65
Just is so wonderful and I went out into the street. And felt so. I didn't feel strange at that time.

43
00:07:24,18 --> 00:07:30,73
It really was an exceptionally poor country. It was living on the Marshall Plan.

44
00:07:30,75 --> 00:07:41,23
Taking this pic eighty out of that came from the United States. And things were awfully.

45
00:07:41,25 --> 00:07:46,51
And one of the things that I had I found in one of the streets

46
00:07:46,51 --> 00:07:52,39
and I thought it was a little shop that sold Italian blouses and cardigans and pullovers

47
00:07:53,13 --> 00:08:02,83
and they were pure pullovers and cardigans So what do I do. I mean usually by a yellow pullover and cardigan.

48
00:08:04,5 --> 00:08:10,59
I had taken money to do this kind of thing because I had a friend who'd been there. And had bought her.

49
00:08:12,2 --> 00:08:16,87
Thank you so I thought out take the money and. And I did.

50
00:08:18,03 --> 00:08:21,78
And what I would go into the shops the telly and women would come

51
00:08:21,78 --> 00:08:25,38
and look in my face because they'd never seen a black face before.

52
00:08:26,7 --> 00:08:41,98
And they would touch my cheek and they all laugh and I put their arms around me. Just.

53
00:08:42,78 --> 00:08:57,15
And then to go and see the ruins of Pompei. And I pinched off and I thought. Am I really frightened.

54
00:08:57,18 --> 00:09:04,44
Am I this person who came from Mobile umbrella. Or promote no.

55
00:09:04,45 --> 00:09:11,46
Never in Hawaii streams into thinking he would leave the shores of Australia.

56
00:09:11,48 --> 00:09:20,2
And here are you walking through the ruins of pump. And pump I said many things to me.

57
00:09:22,15 --> 00:09:30,53
And it told me yourself the great culture that must surely have been there. That was buried.

58
00:09:31,38 --> 00:09:41,53
And I sat there and looked at that wonderful mount in the distance blue and deep blue. And they probably.

59
00:09:43,75 --> 00:09:57,31
Just one of my. Italy did great things. So after quite some time some young. Million. Italian men.

60
00:09:57,91 --> 00:10:02,41
Came and said that they would now be in charge of us they were working for peace.

61
00:10:03,62 --> 00:10:10,58
And they would have screwed us in the past up to. And you know.

62
00:10:10,68 --> 00:10:16,57
I was full of never a question when you just went it was a different situation in the world.

63
00:10:16,59 --> 00:10:31,98
And there was tremendous trust with this and I too much people just wanted to leave. The bus a big beautiful big story.

64
00:10:32,61 --> 00:10:41,49
And we were housed in pinch you're all about it you know. And there were very rich.

65
00:10:42,00 --> 00:10:46,64
Romans who were involved in the work for peace to abolish.

66
00:10:47,33 --> 00:10:59,01
And to make sure that the fastest were thrown out of the country and. They would talk about the war to the Australians.

67
00:11:00,46 --> 00:11:09,17
And tell the Australians what it was like when the now two jack boots walked the beautiful streets over.

68
00:11:09,95 --> 00:11:23,52
And they talked about Italian fastest. Who joined up with German Nazis and murdered their. And it was different.

69
00:11:23,75 --> 00:11:27,31
I mean you read about things but when it comes as it were from the horse's mouth.

70
00:11:29,04 --> 00:11:40,17
It's well it said to me to look there you dropped. You have to put every atom of energy. Into working to eliminate war.

71
00:11:41,66 --> 00:11:51,07
That's what it said to me and said it was to be with these young people and they were all the people.

72
00:11:51,88 --> 00:11:59,95
Who went into the streets and would say to me. This is where my brother were shot. This is where my father were shot.

73
00:12:01,32 --> 00:12:14,65
By the Germans by the Italian. And I went to St Pete. And are so well in the attic.

74
00:12:15,91 --> 00:12:19,4
Worth billions and billions of dollars

75
00:12:19,4 --> 00:12:25,16
and the problems of the Italian people could have been solved overnight if they'd sell some of their junk

76
00:12:27,14 --> 00:12:38,07
and I walked to the very pinnacle of the tumor saying to go. The dome of St Peter's.

77
00:12:38,73 --> 00:12:48,88
And the steps were so worn it was like putting my feet into holes of concrete and I would look at some of the day

78
00:12:48,88 --> 00:12:54,47
and I thought well things I did when I could when I had the strength.

79
00:12:56,67 --> 00:13:01,54
And there was one request and we were there in the summer. That we should.

80
00:13:02,19 --> 00:13:11,7
Cover our heads with a scarf and the main couldn't wear shorts. And that was OK. No but it was respect.

81
00:13:13,4 --> 00:13:23,93
So I spent a few days coming and going to the Vatican. I knew that they hadn't raised and.

82
00:13:26,41 --> 00:13:32,97
To help the Jews in any way I looked at the world.

83
00:13:32,99 --> 00:13:47,6
Literally and had told us that the Vatican could have done much to keep the Nazis out of Italy and I didn't.

84
00:13:47,62 --> 00:13:58,19
So then I said after we had a great and they are mean we saw a lot. And being. Going along the happy and worry.

85
00:13:58,61 --> 00:14:07,12
Well I think when I said child at Sunday school. I was told about a peer peer and where was that poor all over.

86
00:14:07,15 --> 00:14:12,98
Whoever it was who went along. And here are poor. It was.

87
00:14:13,79 --> 00:14:16,14
And I don't know if other people felt the why I did

88
00:14:16,14 --> 00:14:25,91
but I felt so fortunate that I could actually walk there put my feet down on the way

89
00:14:27,92 --> 00:14:31,93
and then finally they said well now we're going to do you know.

90
00:14:31,94 --> 00:14:40,59
So we're hoping the passes again you know I mean the bloody fast these narrow roads man with one hand on the horn one

91
00:14:40,59 --> 00:14:50,85
on the steering wheel. You know but finally we got to. In general at that time had a communist Council.

92
00:14:52,21 --> 00:15:00,56
And they worked very very closely with the Christians and with the Social Democrats

93
00:15:02,46 --> 00:15:17,07
and they were all into tech looked after us. But you see. The Cold War I would say was almost at its peak. And.

94
00:15:17,08 --> 00:15:25,25
The police were watching us because they knew we were going into East Berlin. Now at that time.

95
00:15:25,26 --> 00:15:35,4
Many had already made it illegal. For Australians to travel into the Eastern Bloc and the name as well.

96
00:15:36,24 --> 00:15:37,5
So we carried a passport.

97
00:15:37,92 --> 00:15:43,14
That said our passport was not valid for the Eastern Bloc

98
00:15:43,14 --> 00:15:54,74
and listed all the countries Czechoslovakia Hungary remaining the Soviet Union. And then also China and Vietnam.

99
00:15:54,76 --> 00:16:02,34
So I could say that because it just reminds me that it wasn't an easy thing to be traveling into the Eastern Bloc

100
00:16:02,34 --> 00:16:15,96
and we. Into East Berlin. In. You know how we were taken over the great doc. Yeah it's great.

101
00:16:16,19 --> 00:16:32,55
Doc works around the trade unionists and. Then one day he apparently told the leaders of application. Look we tell you.

102
00:16:32,57 --> 00:16:40,47
Just movement is still active and many are in the police force. We have to get you out of the you know.

103
00:16:42,12 --> 00:16:54,48
Where you will just take you so once again we got into buses and we waited outside.

104
00:16:56,05 --> 00:17:12,88
What the narrow country roads which were plastered with slogans and Logan's would read what's the word for word

105
00:17:22,83 --> 00:17:39,04
and the French word any. Bread and. All along the narrow roads. So not much wider than.

106
00:17:40,15 --> 00:17:49,85
The all stars were covered with this white. People who were hosting you could.

107
00:17:49,87 --> 00:18:03,79
Suspect that you were under threat that there was some real danger. Most certainly. And so we got in the past.

108
00:18:04,62 --> 00:18:10,41
We drove past and finally the bus stop and we had to take I'm lucky day.

109
00:18:11,56 --> 00:18:20,69
And I said Now I will help you all to get to the top of this mountain. And it was called Mt Kaga later.

110
00:18:20,71 --> 00:18:25,93
And nothing could go up there except a flying fox you know Fox.

111
00:18:25,95 --> 00:18:33,64
And so they sent our stuff up by flying fox and that was my first trip.

112
00:18:34,98 --> 00:18:43,31
And many trips that I made since then I never took more than one suitcase and my handbag.

113
00:18:43,33 --> 00:18:47,17
A little pack for the plane you know but that was it.

114
00:18:47,18 --> 00:18:53,6
It always has been that way ever since and I was so grateful that I just had this one bag.

115
00:18:53,62 --> 00:18:57,01
And then we had to climb this mountain. So ninety one.

116
00:18:59,94 --> 00:19:09,98
But they humor kept us going through all of all people who are young and strong. In finding we got the top.

117
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:18,37
And they were whole lot of teams. And.

118
00:19:18,39 --> 00:19:32,1
And then he told us that over a very simple me you know off soup with a little bone in it. Beef and the soup head spin.

119
00:19:32,12 --> 00:19:40,75
Each not very much. And pester. And rolls and I baked the rolls some more and brought them here.

120
00:19:41,39 --> 00:19:51,46
Very little food in Italy very little and they told us that that was the case for the telly and party movement.

121
00:19:52,23 --> 00:20:04,74
That I had used it and. At night. The young. Partisans who were. Would talk to us about being patters in the war.

122
00:20:06,14 --> 00:20:15,98
Against mostly me and Hitler. And the leader. There was a man by the name of Frank a young man. And he said.

123
00:20:17,69 --> 00:20:33,35
How are his father was also in the Patterson movement and the fastest quote a group of party. Partisans dig a trench.

124
00:20:33,37 --> 00:20:42,54
And they instilled them all up and shot them. And his father feigned. Survived.

125
00:20:43,12 --> 00:20:47,65
And he was there in the came looking after the water supply and what have you.

126
00:20:50,57 --> 00:20:55,43
There was very little food and bad luck in my tale

127
00:20:55,43 --> 00:21:04,01
and there were the people from the Latin American countries so they'd sing or dance and sing.

128
00:21:04,19 --> 00:21:12,22
When they'd met but it was a great opportunity for rehearsing and dances and so on.

129
00:21:12,24 --> 00:21:18,81
And that was carried out every night. Then one day.

130
00:21:19,33 --> 00:21:27,02
One of the leaders of the tell you new movement came up and said well the police now know you're here.

131
00:21:28,54 --> 00:21:29,77
And we have to get you out.

132
00:21:31,7 --> 00:21:39,1
And the most important group was a man who could dance group because they were organized they had something to present

133
00:21:39,1 --> 00:21:50,21
a struggle. And it was said they would get the highest priority. So together with my fellow dances.

134
00:21:50,69 --> 00:21:59,4
We were taken down from the mountain. And a little brass came and picked us up and took us to Milan.

135
00:22:00,19 --> 00:22:10,38
And in Milan we were put on trial. And when a sentence you Rick. Asked my question. I just.

136
00:22:12,35 --> 00:22:23,06
We got out of the train greeted nans who took us to what have they pinch.

137
00:22:23,08 --> 00:22:31,94
I could not fully what was put on the breakfast table across someone's piles of jam and butter and cream

138
00:22:33,29 --> 00:22:43,57
and the milk would come in large jugs coffee. You could drink gallons of it if you wanted to Switzerland.

139
00:22:43,59 --> 00:22:52,73
So we stayed in Zurich for quite a while and I thought it was beautiful. Of everything in the street.

140
00:22:54,88 --> 00:23:01,34
And someone came and said Well it's time now.

141
00:23:02,48 --> 00:23:10,09
We want to be there for the opening we'll be held up in Austria for a long time. But we'll go up to Austria now.

142
00:23:10,53 --> 00:23:18,02
And they were very worried about sending the dance group by train because in into broke.

143
00:23:18,51 --> 00:23:23,36
There were the Russian soldiers but also the American soldiers

144
00:23:24,58 --> 00:23:31,96
and the Americans were there to make sure nobody crossed the border in fact because in Austria was under four powers.

145
00:23:33,57 --> 00:23:44,85
And. It was very dicey extremely dicey. But I was with the group so they said no we're going to send you home by plane.

146
00:23:45,89 --> 00:23:53,76
And we were sent in an old French plane that rattled and I only prayed that it would get over the Great.

147
00:23:55,1 --> 00:23:59,21
Graft Lochner with her safely because the snow was.

148
00:23:59,22 --> 00:24:12,32
And all of you know snow covered mountains here and we got over and he landed in Vienna and they were made. Austrians.

149
00:24:12,34 --> 00:24:20,46
And I had a small army too of peace because they had to intervene and they knew about

150
00:24:21,63 --> 00:24:31,89
and those who resisted the Nazis were reorganizing again those who were murdered are might. And so they took us on.

151
00:24:31,91 --> 00:24:39,47
And they said look just for a night we have to put you in rather uncomfortable but fortunately.

152
00:24:39,49 --> 00:24:42,13
We'll put you in a school which we still have.

153
00:24:42,53 --> 00:24:48,74
And the school was next to our market the market had been bombed out and part of the school had been bombed.

154
00:24:49,15 --> 00:24:53,71
But we were housed in the school and then they'd take us into the market for breakfast

155
00:24:55,24 --> 00:25:02,35
and they would be just lovely hot milk coffee and. And Abaddon. And after a couple of days they say.

156
00:25:02,87 --> 00:25:14,38
We have to hide you look in and they took us to a place outside of the. Well I called Spark.

157
00:25:15,32 --> 00:25:25,73
And there was nothing but a stream of water. And some very primitive little tidbits that we were to sleep in.

158
00:25:26,88 --> 00:25:33,1
We left the bulk of that was being cared for in the school which just took a raft close

159
00:25:33,1 --> 00:25:40,3
but we were up there for a whole fortnight actually sleeping under the stars and.

160
00:25:40,32 --> 00:25:58,82
And I'll tell you who was they had to break. A lot. And he was hiding. He was afraid. He was also there.

161
00:25:58,84 --> 00:26:16,65
And he observed. What have you. And. And so. Maybe we just had family. Didn't know how to live.

162
00:26:18,57 --> 00:26:26,24
And there was a local pub to have a road on the edge of the Danube and it was owned by a woman.

163
00:26:28,12 --> 00:26:37,81
And pubs in the country they were pretty rough believe you me but we'd go down there and we buy our lunch there.

164
00:26:38,34 --> 00:26:39,85
And it was very.

165
00:26:40,55 --> 00:26:48,72
You know she would make these huge blocks of bread there but more like a damp than a bread

166
00:26:49,42 --> 00:26:53,07
and you could have a bowel of beef soup.

167
00:26:53,09 --> 00:27:00,13
And you sat at these long tables but there was plenty off and she used to put barley and rice in.

168
00:27:00,84 --> 00:27:13,13
And so we we had more food there than we had over in Italy and these great big miners and what he's needed.

169
00:27:14,19 --> 00:27:23,96
And she used to make the most wonderful cakes. So she would do the cakes down in the basement.

170
00:27:23,97 --> 00:27:28,76
And down in the basement she kept all her very precious.

171
00:27:28,78 --> 00:27:39,13
Like yours to use to look yours to flavor the cakes and one night we were there and she invited us down.

172
00:27:39,32 --> 00:27:43,59
That was raping the Aboriginal prison travelling with us and myself

173
00:27:44,6 --> 00:27:52,08
and Ray by then had become very poorly with daughter. I'm sure he'd taken the daughter after he came out.

174
00:27:52,54 --> 00:27:58,75
So the daughter said Come Dance days when Mum's cake. And by this time.

175
00:27:58,85 --> 00:28:04,25
Ray and I have got a favorite German we know what cake is if we did and much else

176
00:28:04,25 --> 00:28:10,58
and I had done a fair bit of German before I left with Paul. So we were able to communicate with this woman and.

177
00:28:10,68 --> 00:28:18,05
Daughter and we sat at a great big table downstairs and they gave us a little bit of apricot le Cure and a cake.

178
00:28:18,11 --> 00:28:29,06
Each and then the mother fell asleep she was exhausted and her and Ray set there and I ate eggs. So I said to write a.

179
00:28:30,41 --> 00:28:33,33
You should lay some money and eat it.

180
00:28:33,54 --> 00:28:44,47
Of course but things like this were happening there was no such thing as a shower. So you use the stream which ran.

181
00:28:44,86 --> 00:28:48,9
Which the camp was around and you'd go there to the stream

182
00:28:48,9 --> 00:28:53,37
but you'd have to make sure that you were like at the very top of the stream.

183
00:28:53,55 --> 00:29:02,47
Because if you're down on the bottom you could reach shore sake someone would be at the top looking down arm.

184
00:29:02,49 --> 00:29:06,58
So we bathed in the strain and we washed in the stream.

185
00:29:07,8 --> 00:29:13,28
And I had to pinch myself to believe that I was going on to the city of Berlin

186
00:29:14,32 --> 00:29:29,68
and here I am off in a stream in Austria and washing my clothes that are going to the local pub to you or so.

187
00:29:29,7 --> 00:29:34,71
The local policeman. Became extremely helpful.

188
00:29:35,64 --> 00:29:42,06
And it was interesting you know I've had a gutful of the nutsy these people who were full

189
00:29:42,91 --> 00:29:53,06
and he couldn't get on his bike and go and ring up for the organizers and it was just lovely. Then one day he.

190
00:29:54,62 --> 00:29:59,76
The leader of one of the youth came and said You have to get an extra tomorrow.

191
00:30:00,14 --> 00:30:09,27
To battle in so we packed up with back to the school. But that day turned into three or four days.

192
00:30:10,68 --> 00:30:15,54
And I was able to see more of it here and there and to experience.

193
00:30:16,08 --> 00:30:29,6
Coffee in a coffee shop and it was as I had read about it and you could see it would interrupt.

194
00:30:30,4 --> 00:30:38,51
The atmosphere with many of course. But there was the man who smoked his cigar in a pipe.

195
00:30:38,52 --> 00:30:46,06
Who ended and I could walk the streets and I bought it in there and.

196
00:30:46,34 --> 00:31:01,03
To go with my golden pullovers from Italy and I was so pleased because it's took me. Well in London.

197
00:31:01,05 --> 00:31:12,83
And I went and looked at the Opera House which had not been restored and the badly. I felt quite at peace there.

198
00:31:12,85 --> 00:31:22,71
Go out at night and we'd see the British marching in the streets. The Americans all the soldiers who'd. The Russians.

199
00:31:23,44 --> 00:31:35,69
And finally they said well it's time to get the train. So we all packed off to the west Bahnhof I'll stop.
