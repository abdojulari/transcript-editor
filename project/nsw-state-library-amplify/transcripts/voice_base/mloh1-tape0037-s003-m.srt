1
00:00:05,98 --> 00:00:12,25
I'm speaking to mr peach who were work
to the city hope bridge. Public works

2
00:00:12,25 --> 00:00:19,09
approaches. This is tape too we were
just talking about the metropolitan

3
00:00:19,10 --> 00:00:25,25
rowing construction and hyde park.
Yes i can well recall the huge holes

4
00:00:26,24 --> 00:00:32,28
that were dug in hyde park. Both northern
and southern meaning and again over and

5
00:00:32,28 --> 00:00:38,50
when you park for women sation. Mostly
by day labor and with very little

6
00:00:38,50 --> 00:00:45,03
mechanical of very little
mechanical help. I can well recall.

7
00:00:46,37 --> 00:00:49,06
Particularly on the hyde park side or

8
00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:55,86
a dry the horses dry yes we used to
carry away this has been excavated

9
00:00:56,73 --> 00:01:01,49
. From the station and it would
go down. It was taken down

10
00:01:04,27 --> 00:01:09,23
live or straight to the bottom of the little
falls freed and dreams of the head of

11
00:01:09,23 --> 00:01:14,41
darling harbour and now
provides us the the good siding

12
00:01:14,41 --> 00:01:20,25
a space for the good side at darley home
so good. Do you remember on the north side

13
00:01:20,25 --> 00:01:26,48
as well that the ceremonies they had
starting the bridge on the north side and no

14
00:01:26,48 --> 00:01:32,85
sydney station. No i did i could i was
on the some sign my point was this that

15
00:01:32,85 --> 00:01:38,47
dr bradfield was being i suppose with with
his ministers approval in fact ministers

16
00:01:38,47 --> 00:01:41,44
. Connived shall we say he didn't have

17
00:01:42,35 --> 00:01:46,31
a contract or any surety that the
bridge would be started in yet they had

18
00:01:46,31 --> 00:01:51,93
a public ceremony whereby the bridge was
started before the contract had been let

19
00:01:51,93 --> 00:01:58,71
go. I don't recall anything on
that at all. No this butler was

20
00:01:58,71 --> 00:02:02,01
there as well i didn't see anybody else
from the office did you know her yet.

21
00:02:03,20 --> 00:02:09,13
Talked about your secretary.
She was rather one of my

22
00:02:09,87 --> 00:02:13,74
strata down there but she was quite

23
00:02:13,74 --> 00:02:20,48
a lot. She was right. Your brother butler
sister. Yes tried to make the sister and

24
00:02:21,46 --> 00:02:25,62
she had charge of the typing and what it
now. We know was the typing bureau and

25
00:02:25,62 --> 00:02:30,93
wanted to try chris and an office on the
other side of talked about hurdles. My

26
00:02:30,93 --> 00:02:33,13
name my nose. Yes

27
00:02:33,14 --> 00:02:37,20
a lot of people have questioned her
position but in actual fact she was this

28
00:02:37,20 --> 00:02:41,93
confidential secretary wasn't she. Yes
yes. She mattox you and i were seized with

29
00:02:41,93 --> 00:02:48,47
one of the groups when jeanette
who went across i did not. He

30
00:02:48,91 --> 00:02:50,02
was overseas with

31
00:02:50,02 --> 00:02:56,27
a group of engineers from his
staff to examine. Possible

32
00:02:57,42 --> 00:03:00,48
tenderers for the construction of

33
00:03:00,49 --> 00:03:07,42
a harbor bridge and. Was
still back in sydney

34
00:03:07,42 --> 00:03:13,89
and has in documentaries was
she became aware. Now that's

35
00:03:13,89 --> 00:03:18,27
a good way to put together she
became aware that there was

36
00:03:18,27 --> 00:03:24,56
a moon when i went on the idea of
calling dr bradfield and his staff

37
00:03:25,45 --> 00:03:26,79
and putting

38
00:03:27,85 --> 00:03:34,83
a stop to any further work on
the. On the development of the

39
00:03:34,83 --> 00:03:40,88
bridge itself. They were going to send
him the cable on tell him she were

40
00:03:40,88 --> 00:03:47,83
fortunately knew exactly where dr
bradfield was that time so completely

41
00:03:47,83 --> 00:03:51,07
horrible ition. She said dr.

42
00:03:51,07 --> 00:03:55,44
Brent feel the cable and suggesting he
should be somewhere else for that particular

43
00:03:55,44 --> 00:04:01,93
style i never caught up with him. I
wondered i documented if you see. Because

44
00:04:02,79 --> 00:04:06,98
i don't know what i did the research. I
knew something that happened because he

45
00:04:06,98 --> 00:04:12,20
said he had not received the cable
and i thought well he's not

46
00:04:12,20 --> 00:04:17,39
a man to lie and he said he didn't receive
the cable that he didn't receive the

47
00:04:17,39 --> 00:04:20,41
cable but i was awfully
sure that there was

48
00:04:20,41 --> 00:04:27,40
a nelson trick in here somewhere and you
just. Just filled it in for. What happened

49
00:04:27,40 --> 00:04:33,63
was the government changed of course and
it was indeed they were indeed thinking of

50
00:04:33,63 --> 00:04:37,54
dropping the bridge and the reason for
this because the government came in was

51
00:04:37,54 --> 00:04:39,81
a coalition with a country
party wasn't called

52
00:04:39,81 --> 00:04:44,15
a country party then it was the country
party and they particularly broke and was

53
00:04:44,15 --> 00:04:48,36
leader leading the party at that time and
they wanted the bridge dropped and it was

54
00:04:48,36 --> 00:04:53,52
it was touch and go. Indeed it's very
interesting. He went at it. He didn't get.

55
00:04:55,99 --> 00:05:01,63
No that's resonating. I wondered well how
that was worked. She was she she paid

56
00:05:01,63 --> 00:05:07,69
a key position. She is to advise him what
was going on but that wasn't the point of

57
00:05:08,51 --> 00:05:11,55
her job but the reason i understand it was
some jealousy of her position did you

58
00:05:11,55 --> 00:05:16,19
ever hear that i was i understand there
was some jealousy of her position did you

59
00:05:16,19 --> 00:05:21,38
ever hear anything about them. No i don't
think so. I don't know the jealousy would

60
00:05:23,48 --> 00:05:24,66
. She was there

61
00:05:24,66 --> 00:05:30,59
a long time before the british actually
started. Yes i was aware of that and of

62
00:05:30,59 --> 00:05:34,76
course when the bridge actually started
she left and went and got married she

63
00:05:34,76 --> 00:05:40,18
married and went to queensland and another
secretary took over but it was she who

64
00:05:40,19 --> 00:05:44,94
was the current provided the confidential
link. While he was overseas and only she

65
00:05:44,94 --> 00:05:49,25
knew everything that the tenderest because
he sent his report back and incidentally

66
00:05:49,25 --> 00:05:50,13
out. I can't find

67
00:05:50,13 --> 00:05:56,38
a copy of this report. Every
meeting that he had. He

68
00:05:56,39 --> 00:05:57,90
risk got

69
00:05:57,90 --> 00:06:04,46
a transcript typed out of the meeting was
taken shorthand of the transcripts were

70
00:06:04,46 --> 00:06:09,10
typed out and they were sent back two copies
in two different lots of mail in case

71
00:06:09,10 --> 00:06:13,23
anything happened and the one person who
provided that link at the other end was

72
00:06:13,23 --> 00:06:18,35
miss butler and she had all the information
and he had all the information on all

73
00:06:18,35 --> 00:06:22,43
the proper proposals of the tenderers so
that he knew exactly what their tenders

74
00:06:22,43 --> 00:06:25,63
were going to be before he got them. But

75
00:06:25,63 --> 00:06:31,51
a so only he and she and the personal
staff i believed stuckey mr stuckey and

76
00:06:31,51 --> 00:06:35,09
a couple of others would know. Did you know
any of the confidential arrangements of

77
00:06:35,09 --> 00:06:40,85
the likelihood of the tenders. Now i'd
know i don't think i did but i've got

78
00:06:40,85 --> 00:06:47,23
a copy of that report. Is what i was aware
the point was that she was confidential

79
00:06:47,23 --> 00:06:50,67
in that respect that she kept that instantly
i can't find either of the copies they

80
00:06:50,67 --> 00:06:55,08
were to definitely definitely two copies
of this book which was for the minister's

81
00:06:55,08 --> 00:07:01,05
eyes only. But here was two copies and i
can't find either the copies i know there

82
00:07:01,05 --> 00:07:06,11
are and i've heard that there are and
but i can't find them. You'd have

83
00:07:06,11 --> 00:07:10,19
a look at this one that i got to.
Well that feels really it was a quite

84
00:07:10,19 --> 00:07:16,09
a long while after i got that i get tired
i think it. Don't quite or in what it was

85
00:07:16,09 --> 00:07:22,91
when here afterwards. Now there is has
fascinating. Do you remember any other sort

86
00:07:22,91 --> 00:07:29,66
of inside stories are there in the office
there. Not inside stories. I remember

87
00:07:29,66 --> 00:07:34,96
the night i took raised.
We were we were. There.

88
00:07:36,62 --> 00:07:43,47
He from time to time as the ridge was
proceeding he used to take well he would

89
00:07:43,47 --> 00:07:48,43
arrange for parties taken
over the bridge. Dr.

90
00:07:48,43 --> 00:07:51,45
Redfield would arrange doc
about feel with a room. Yes

91
00:07:51,45 --> 00:07:58,37
a doctor about and it
to celia raines more or

92
00:07:58,37 --> 00:08:05,26
less unofficially but and he relied
very lively on his staff to provide

93
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,81
the people who could to company who is
around on the show were told what was going

94
00:08:10,81 --> 00:08:17,69
on and one afternoon. I've
been asked. I think it can

95
00:08:17,70 --> 00:08:23,29
you. What are you doing tonight. How. I
said well and i think bruce and i got some

96
00:08:23,29 --> 00:08:28,06
iranians really and they said well look he
said do you think is an each answer tour

97
00:08:29,58 --> 00:08:34,98
coming as he was some professor or might
have been and chancellor of one of the

98
00:08:34,98 --> 00:08:39,15
american universities here some pretty
is somebody or some considerable

99
00:08:39,15 --> 00:08:44,79
significance and i said well
look our going out with

100
00:08:44,79 --> 00:08:48,90
a rosy fix. He said all of our bringing
rose. I said you think it we all right.

101
00:08:49,01 --> 00:08:54,05
Usages i have to talk to break. Just come
in all that will be right. So fair enough

102
00:08:54,05 --> 00:08:59,87
. Rows and i met the party. Somewhere over
the north sydney you know. Well rosalynn

103
00:08:59,87 --> 00:09:05,86
she was. Well i arrived pretty
you know very effective

104
00:09:05,86 --> 00:09:12,79
a very hearty laugh. And the
party got off somewhere about

105
00:09:12,79 --> 00:09:18,04
half way across the bridge of the right
level. Somebody in mark they couldn't see

106
00:09:19,15 --> 00:09:26,02
the guest of honor. Must remember i saw her
back she was back with this chancellor

107
00:09:27,27 --> 00:09:28,83
and then again he peels

108
00:09:28,83 --> 00:09:32,87
a laugh from the other side of the room.
He's right and commandeered the prince.

109
00:09:33,51 --> 00:09:34,96
Visited dr.

110
00:09:34,96 --> 00:09:39,94
Bradfield of all staff.
This. He recalls he was

111
00:09:39,94 --> 00:09:46,43
a v.i.p. But there was very embarrassed
particularly the following day. Nothing was

112
00:09:46,43 --> 00:09:51,78
said. There's like goodwin

113
00:09:53,96 --> 00:09:54,52
. Quite

114
00:09:54,52 --> 00:10:00,18
a regular thing. A lot of people who are
interested in people of consequence. Oh i

115
00:10:01,94 --> 00:10:04,81
remember the governor-general
and lieutenant governor. I have

116
00:10:04,81 --> 00:10:09,02
a picture of them on top of the arch.
They were they went up just after it was

117
00:10:09,02 --> 00:10:14,40
joined you know i know i don't recall and
but i remember gary that was his name

118
00:10:16,31 --> 00:10:20,72
. Sir. Somebody yeah i think he must have
been the guy. He was i think he was the.

119
00:10:21,39 --> 00:10:28,08
The. The governor-general at that time was

120
00:10:28,08 --> 00:10:34,85
stunned of an lots donovan stonehaven. Yes.
That ought to be the governor-general i

121
00:10:34,85 --> 00:10:35,39
remember seeing

122
00:10:35,39 --> 00:10:42,77
a photograph on had he was very
well an english players and. I have

123
00:10:42,77 --> 00:10:46,38
a feeling that might have been his time
there were so william cullen he was the

124
00:10:46,38 --> 00:10:50,42
local deputy deputy
governor of course there's

125
00:10:50,42 --> 00:10:54,09
a state governor but of course bradfield
would know him very well because he was

126
00:10:54,09 --> 00:10:57,76
there also the chancellor of sydney university
at one stage. They were on the scene

127
00:10:57,76 --> 00:10:59,71
and he was on the senate who did you have

128
00:10:59,71 --> 00:11:04,82
a university education at all it did you
do you like quiet myself i don't know. For

129
00:11:04,82 --> 00:11:09,71
some after be able to stay long enough
to go to graduate. Most of dr bradfield

130
00:11:09,71 --> 00:11:15,09
staff were all. We're all graduates and
yet you yet you served your time. So to

131
00:11:15,09 --> 00:11:20,69
speak. Yes i suppose you put it that way
so he wasn't i was under the impression

132
00:11:20,69 --> 00:11:25,47
that he sort of deliberately picked everybody
who has graduates and if your odd man

133
00:11:25,47 --> 00:11:32,32
out. I can ask well he picked
you as well yes in fact

134
00:11:32,32 --> 00:11:32,67
to do

135
00:11:32,67 --> 00:11:39,04
a personal job to all i can say is this and
this is not for the record but when the

136
00:11:39,04 --> 00:11:45,87
national. Sydney harbor bridge
staff was selected. For the.

137
00:11:46,53 --> 00:11:53,32
There was gordon stuckey.
Bill ice myself and roger

138
00:11:53,32 --> 00:12:00,10
but we were there for original probably
work stuff all right. Avoidable.

139
00:12:00,27 --> 00:12:07,26
Stuff and those i suppose we were
frankly. Oh yes i. He was he

140
00:12:07,27 --> 00:12:13,96
was never in the office. There was
frankly roper there were several but

141
00:12:15,21 --> 00:12:20,03
we all went to the war didn't say yes yes
it was light horsemen. What he didn't

142
00:12:20,03 --> 00:12:25,84
know that he was like no he died
so yeah. Somebody tell you.

143
00:12:27,87 --> 00:12:30,58
I haven't have now when they trying
to record it immediately died

144
00:12:30,58 --> 00:12:34,65
a little while ago but he wrote
some some things about dr.

145
00:12:34,65 --> 00:12:41,55
Bradfield for his daughter mary and she
has them. There were some interesting

146
00:12:41,55 --> 00:12:47,83
little vignettes which he wrote
for her. Miss mary bradfield and

147
00:12:47,83 --> 00:12:54,61
frankly she feels wife were
friends. Was that it. You

148
00:12:54,62 --> 00:13:00,70
didn't know him very much. As an officer
queensland's and what not. Not personally

149
00:13:00,70 --> 00:13:05,25
very much. Very well i would come in contact
with the only because he was outside.

150
00:13:05,57 --> 00:13:11,81
We were inside most of the time. And what.
What about you were separate your branch

151
00:13:11,81 --> 00:13:18,78
was your design of the approaches.
Yeah yeah i was really pushed

152
00:13:18,79 --> 00:13:23,37
into that because i knew something about
the right way. Location system or so far

153
00:13:23,37 --> 00:13:29,80
as he was concerned. And so you weren't
involved with the checking or the design of

154
00:13:29,80 --> 00:13:34,87
the main bridge. No no that's
principally studies. And he had

155
00:13:34,87 --> 00:13:39,37
a team with him as well. Oh yes yes. Where
did they work in relation to where your

156
00:13:39,37 --> 00:13:44,80
team was you know we had we had practically
had most of the third floor in the

157
00:13:44,80 --> 00:13:49,32
works department where we just went to one
of the one of the officers there. Where

158
00:13:49,32 --> 00:13:52,39
did you live when you worked in
the workbook. You know. After

159
00:13:52,39 --> 00:13:58,94
a long hard road here and you went to
work on the ferry naturally. Yes yes. You

160
00:13:58,95 --> 00:14:02,21
member of the life around sydney in those
days. What did you do for recreation.

161
00:14:07,21 --> 00:14:09,25
I saw tennis as you might see

162
00:14:09,25 --> 00:14:14,09
a time in those days as travelling on
work and study. What hours of work you do

163
00:14:14,09 --> 00:14:20,24
have though what hours of work. Did
you have oh i think we started

164
00:14:21,36 --> 00:14:23,95
about nine of the morning
till half past four and now

165
00:14:23,95 --> 00:14:30,42
a lunch. How many days five
days. This is. This is

166
00:14:31,86 --> 00:14:38,81
officially but working work
time was pretty flexible as

167
00:14:38,81 --> 00:14:44,54
days. And if you had to work late you didn't
get paid an extra for it not. Oh no no

168
00:14:44,54 --> 00:14:50,77
no. I know that's why i
got that somehow assembly

169
00:14:52,57 --> 00:14:53,26
. Yes

170
00:14:53,26 --> 00:14:56,79
a doctor redfield well of course he was
working on schemes which he didn't really

171
00:14:56,79 --> 00:15:00,77
turn into money either. He was doing it
for the for the thing he was doing it

172
00:15:00,77 --> 00:15:07,52
through his interests but the other
ones that i was most aware of was the.

173
00:15:08,62 --> 00:15:15,61
Only the milling transport
right or facilities is on

174
00:15:15,61 --> 00:15:20,89
the law side of the highway here.
The story bridge and the us and

175
00:15:22,47 --> 00:15:28,45
turning back of the irrigation of the
worst since western plains. That

176
00:15:29,47 --> 00:15:35,27
i have come across a man who worked
in the same sort of thing for dr.

177
00:15:35,27 --> 00:15:41,35
Bradfield when he was working on the story
bridge in queensland. And he is name was

178
00:15:41,35 --> 00:15:46,66
snowden bill snowden
snowden. Enter it. He was

179
00:15:46,66 --> 00:15:51,78
a young engineer and he worked in the drawing
office for on the design of the story

180
00:15:51,78 --> 00:15:56,26
bridge in brisbane and he did the
approaches and he worked directly with dr

181
00:15:56,26 --> 00:16:01,67
bradfield and dr bradfield also got him
to do other jobs and he went out and took

182
00:16:01,67 --> 00:16:08,16
the levels for the inland water scheme.
Did he know i doubt now that actually he

183
00:16:08,16 --> 00:16:13,73
said that one day when he'd been
working for dr bradfield on the st.

184
00:16:13,73 --> 00:16:14,09
Lucie

185
00:16:14,09 --> 00:16:21,15
a university and they were university
of queensland site. Plans which. He

186
00:16:21,15 --> 00:16:21,40
spent

187
00:16:21,40 --> 00:16:28,64
a bit of time on as an extra amount
of. A period of time and then one

188
00:16:28,64 --> 00:16:33,60
day. Dr bradfield produced a small
map. He said which was probably

189
00:16:33,60 --> 00:16:37,61
a shilling or two sixpenny map
of queensland on which was drawn

190
00:16:38,71 --> 00:16:45,57
a number of schemes. And he said
to phil snowden. I want you

191
00:16:45,57 --> 00:16:50,23
to take some levels on this and that's how
it started for him due to meredyth think

192
00:16:50,23 --> 00:16:56,41
about that map of orlando. He went out
on foot and horseback and train and

193
00:16:57,12 --> 00:17:03,17
every method and he took the levels for
those by know he was employed by dr.

194
00:17:03,17 --> 00:17:07,69
Bradfield he was paid for it. You know i
wasn't he was given time off from the

195
00:17:07,69 --> 00:17:11,25
bridge. You know he don't have the approach
as you say the bridge was already well

196
00:17:11,25 --> 00:17:18,03
underway and his job was mainly done and
he the design office and here he asked

197
00:17:18,03 --> 00:17:22,03
dr. Redfield asked for mr.

198
00:17:22,03 --> 00:17:25,45
Holt who suggests old
if he could use him for

199
00:17:25,45 --> 00:17:31,16
a while and so he was second to talk about
field doctor brett you're paid into that

200
00:17:31,16 --> 00:17:37,12
. Well that's called some mine when we had
been transferred to mine. Rose and gone

201
00:17:37,12 --> 00:17:43,93
out of order. I wasn't
terribly happy about my

202
00:17:43,94 --> 00:17:44,50
nose for

203
00:17:44,50 --> 00:17:49,93
a level that they weren't very nice people
to work or not engineering was in right

204
00:17:49,93 --> 00:17:56,86
and. I was looking around to

205
00:17:56,86 --> 00:18:02,26
get a job if i could somewhere other
than where we were and dr banfield wrote

206
00:18:02,26 --> 00:18:06,11
a long letter pry offering me

207
00:18:06,98 --> 00:18:12,93
a job up and britain with him to work
on the bridge bridge. And at that time.

208
00:18:13,36 --> 00:18:19,01
Depression was as worst. Nobody
had a job if you had a job your

209
00:18:19,01 --> 00:18:22,42
a terribly lucky. We were expecting

210
00:18:22,42 --> 00:18:29,36
a family here. And i was very taken with
the idea but i thought gosh almighty. If i

211
00:18:29,36 --> 00:18:32,95
go up there and i get a job for a week for

212
00:18:32,95 --> 00:18:39,52
a year or two and then finishes
cypress. I might well be without

213
00:18:39,52 --> 00:18:46,46
a job. It was sort of situation i was
looking forward to. So i unfortunately

214
00:18:47,72 --> 00:18:53,57
wrote to dr and told him that i just couldn't
do it gave him the reasons why. Well

215
00:18:54,36 --> 00:18:56,85
i think that was the last time i had

216
00:18:56,86 --> 00:19:02,29
a direct contract because i
don't know where when dr.

217
00:19:02,29 --> 00:19:08,98
Redfield i and i don't know why it was
that he passed away. And i know whether

218
00:19:08,98 --> 00:19:13,16
it's fairly obvious he went on there.
He was on the brisbane bridge and then

219
00:19:13,16 --> 00:19:17,30
afterwards he was he was very very keen
on the on the inland water scheme and he

220
00:19:17,30 --> 00:19:22,96
started to put all his energies into that
but he didn't have the resources and the

221
00:19:22,97 --> 00:19:28,80
queensland premier turned him down money
wise and i know where it is i don't even

222
00:19:28,80 --> 00:19:35,78
look all. Knowing anything about
him die or whether he was

223
00:19:35,78 --> 00:19:40,16
sick or whether it happened suddenly what
he did just finishing liars away in the.

224
00:19:40,62 --> 00:19:43,78
In in those days you don't get

225
00:19:43,78 --> 00:19:50,53
a lot of contact with people like them.
I never knew she'd. Build lush was he

226
00:19:51,80 --> 00:19:57,94
so i don't know anyone you know. Yes well
that's but that's what he just became ill

227
00:19:57,94 --> 00:20:01,63
. The family say that it was the continuous
travelling up and down to brisbane on

228
00:20:01,63 --> 00:20:05,05
the trains and cold and what have you in
general. Cause he was over seventy already

229
00:20:05,92 --> 00:20:12,23
. And he was still working flat out and
you know although james holt. Sir james

230
00:20:12,23 --> 00:20:17,54
holt later he was in charge of the job as
far as than bradfield was overall there

231
00:20:17,55 --> 00:20:22,07
and he didn't really have i suppose that
awful lot to do but he couldn't sort of

232
00:20:22,07 --> 00:20:28,45
rest he had to go on as far as he was
concerned that was all small it was although

233
00:20:28,45 --> 00:20:29,51
it was all

234
00:20:29,51 --> 00:20:33,25
a sort of preparation for the big one. The
big one was the inland water scheme it

235
00:20:33,25 --> 00:20:37,86
was the irrigation and population. Of the
centre of australia. That was the big one

236
00:20:37,86 --> 00:20:44,60
for him he'd spent all these years.
Yes. On the bridges but that wasn't

237
00:20:44,60 --> 00:20:49,72
a big one and one of dr.

238
00:20:49,72 --> 00:20:56,65
Bradfield staff. Carol. Right carol. Got

239
00:20:56,66 --> 00:21:02,19
exactly the same position
in the south wales. As.

240
00:21:03,83 --> 00:21:10,18
James hold. Yes. We're doing and
in queensland he was director of

241
00:21:11,47 --> 00:21:13,54
public works he was
very well liked. He was

242
00:21:13,54 --> 00:21:18,56
a very very competent engineer. I don't
know never recognize i don't think i ever

243
00:21:18,56 --> 00:21:23,81
did but he was i was a very close friend
of mine is she a good deal if you use

244
00:21:23,81 --> 00:21:30,44
a long sentence together. But these are
past now but when he died but it was right

245
00:21:30,44 --> 00:21:37,29
he was the only man on the staff
the time. The the. With the

246
00:21:37,29 --> 00:21:43,69
moves the main roads and all everything
else that was going on the historic red for

247
00:21:43,69 --> 00:21:46,19
the staff are starting
to disintegrate getting

248
00:21:46,19 --> 00:21:52,14
a little bit. I'm so dissatisfied no
what and rose high up because we've been

249
00:21:52,14 --> 00:21:58,77
married. We were being sent to the city
to the country. She and i got married and

250
00:21:59,92 --> 00:22:04,51
a week or ten days notice it was just
like that. I rang rose i'm going to be

251
00:22:04,51 --> 00:22:08,34
married friday. I said we've got because
i got to go to i got a i've got

252
00:22:08,34 --> 00:22:14,76
a front up down and. Next monday week. And
there was as usual consolation but it

253
00:22:14,76 --> 00:22:21,56
was alright. And right carol. Came on
soros and i hope all that's right now

254
00:22:21,56 --> 00:22:22,58
for their i think

255
00:22:22,58 --> 00:22:28,58
a really person from the whole of dr bradfield
staff or his previous staff that my

256
00:22:28,58 --> 00:22:32,96
that trip. He was one of the resident
engineers for the public works approach is

257
00:22:32,96 --> 00:22:37,01
always he actually supervising the approaches
on the north was he who is that right

258
00:22:38,05 --> 00:22:42,12
now. He was approaching he was one of the
engineers on the approach he he did the

259
00:22:42,12 --> 00:22:44,05
southern approach and arrive

260
00:22:44,05 --> 00:22:47,49
a bit rival to the north side
was he supervising or already

261
00:22:47,49 --> 00:22:53,68
a resident engineer or. I don't know
how you as i think you probably use

262
00:22:54,53 --> 00:22:55,22
classified as

263
00:22:55,22 --> 00:23:00,66
a supervising engineer but whether he did
or didn't live on the job he lived. You

264
00:23:00,67 --> 00:23:05,52
know it. You know and talk
about feel was particular was

265
00:23:05,52 --> 00:23:10,52
a meticulous about the separation of
jobs wasn't easy. You see on the harbour

266
00:23:10,52 --> 00:23:13,63
bridge contracts there was the contract as
was responsible for the building of the

267
00:23:13,63 --> 00:23:18,08
bridge they were also made responsible for
the design and that's where the argument

268
00:23:18,09 --> 00:23:21,93
comes about right. They were made
responsible for the design. Dr.

269
00:23:21,93 --> 00:23:27,03
Bethany all said that it was the he didn't
mean that he said he'd go to bed feels

270
00:23:27,03 --> 00:23:30,11
that he didn't mean that they had to be
responsible for the design it was his

271
00:23:30,11 --> 00:23:35,12
design. They had to be responsible for
the sufficiency of his days of his red

272
00:23:35,12 --> 00:23:39,44
fields design but they
said bowen that's a that's

273
00:23:39,44 --> 00:23:45,34
a whole other design but the point
was this that bradfield was was

274
00:23:46,55 --> 00:23:52,04
particular that they would have responsibility
for superintending their job and

275
00:23:52,04 --> 00:23:55,86
then there would be two resident engineers
one for the steel work and one for the

276
00:23:55,86 --> 00:24:01,35
substructure that's frankly i feel for the
steel work and and roger butler for the

277
00:24:01,35 --> 00:24:04,64
for the substructure for the bridge and
then on the approach is there would be

278
00:24:04,64 --> 00:24:08,65
design engineer for the for the
approaches that was a list

279
00:24:08,65 --> 00:24:13,19
a lush and then there would be two
supervising engineers who would actually

280
00:24:13,19 --> 00:24:20,19
supervise the job of of the pro choose doing
the approaches and then there would be

281
00:24:20,19 --> 00:24:24,34
two resident engineers also for the
approaches one for each side who are

282
00:24:24,34 --> 00:24:29,02
responsible for supervising them. And that
would be separate and that is that that

283
00:24:29,02 --> 00:24:32,14
is the thing that he did. Now which was
mr carroll was he was it was he was

284
00:24:32,14 --> 00:24:36,86
supervising when i was either. The
resident engineer over him who was i think

285
00:24:36,86 --> 00:24:43,82
engineer i would imagine. You were about
to say something and i cut you off.

286
00:24:43,92 --> 00:24:50,14
I'm sorry about the design business. Who
designed what sort of thing is regarding

287
00:24:50,14 --> 00:24:52,76
the bridge. When did i say that

288
00:24:52,76 --> 00:24:58,78
a minute ago i was i got your train of
thought going on and i spoke about you spoke

289
00:24:58,78 --> 00:25:04,57
about the. The start of the
work on north side. Was that

290
00:25:05,77 --> 00:25:12,35
prior to all the the building of the city
railway or after it was well after the

291
00:25:12,35 --> 00:25:18,66
city. I was well on the way when what i'd
done. I did the design for those time

292
00:25:18,66 --> 00:25:24,11
also on the track where retaining walls all
that sort of thing before that started

293
00:25:24,11 --> 00:25:30,76
and roper would be in charge of that work
at sydney. I mean we used to cross and

294
00:25:30,76 --> 00:25:36,88
see him from time to time. Where roper
wasn't in charge of the work in no sydney in

295
00:25:36,88 --> 00:25:39,64
the railway end of things. K

296
00:25:39,64 --> 00:25:45,51
a phrase that was key phrase. Yes. I think
it was the actual during the period of

297
00:25:45,51 --> 00:25:51,69
the construction of the bridge. Because
i know this separation of branches was

298
00:25:51,69 --> 00:25:53,35
carried out carried out to

299
00:25:53,35 --> 00:25:56,94
a certain extent you know keith fraser
who was the son of james frey's of the

300
00:25:56,94 --> 00:26:00,45
railway commission at that time and
later case fraser himself became really

301
00:26:00,45 --> 00:26:06,12
commissioner. I heard that there were some
antipathy between keyes fraser and dr

302
00:26:06,12 --> 00:26:06,90
bradfield from

303
00:26:06,90 --> 00:26:10,45
a number of people later. Do you ever hear
anything of this. No i don't and i don't

304
00:26:10,45 --> 00:26:14,99
remember anything else that it could happen
when i wouldn't know about it. I also

305
00:26:14,99 --> 00:26:19,54
heard that there were some antipathy
between a deejay forced who also became

306
00:26:20,25 --> 00:26:24,06
a railway commissioner who was under
bradfield in the metropolitan area

307
00:26:24,06 --> 00:26:29,11
construction foster that of them and of
course was before he was in the time of

308
00:26:29,11 --> 00:26:35,62
leger and before boyd came to the the top
of the metropolitan really construction

309
00:26:35,62 --> 00:26:42,01
branch. There was in the designing
principle designing engineer was a was

310
00:26:42,02 --> 00:26:47,43
a teacher foster. And ledger was under him
and then was boyd and who was under and

311
00:26:47,43 --> 00:26:54,37
there was somebody else under him. Who
that could be i have it on record. But

312
00:26:54,37 --> 00:26:58,34
you have my not even name of
that site. I was still only

313
00:26:58,34 --> 00:27:03,28
a cadet with the railway
department when i was with undid

314
00:27:04,15 --> 00:27:10,06
a boy in the royal office. Do you remember
the propeller sorry. Do you remember the

315
00:27:10,06 --> 00:27:16,39
prepare for asian of any plans for the
railways. There was before the public works

316
00:27:16,39 --> 00:27:16,96
committee went

317
00:27:16,96 --> 00:27:23,82
a number of proposals for railways.
Gordon to narrabeen and also

318
00:27:23,82 --> 00:27:29,83
the railway to epping and all and on the
other side of the railway to east hills.

319
00:27:30,09 --> 00:27:36,69
Now i don't know they were prepared
under poit i don't know whether he was

320
00:27:36,69 --> 00:27:42,82
solely on the bridge end of things that i
was interested in finished we all know

321
00:27:42,82 --> 00:27:48,24
remained somewhere from memory problems we
had dodgy all these you know how the the

322
00:27:49,04 --> 00:27:52,68
headlands run down what are you going to
do. Did you go through them or do you get

323
00:27:52,68 --> 00:27:59,58
around them or over them. Is what
you would have taken over the plan

324
00:27:59,58 --> 00:28:03,62
that went right down to most men in two
branches wouldn't you wish. They were there

325
00:28:03,62 --> 00:28:08,65
in ginal plan if the city railway in the
northern suburbs was one to two branches

326
00:28:08,65 --> 00:28:13,38
one to go down to muslims and their one
to go down the manly. No no. The the one

327
00:28:13,38 --> 00:28:18,84
that i did was the ones that run like ran
along the city road. And then came down

328
00:28:18,84 --> 00:28:22,72
into manly into the army
only over and there was

329
00:28:22,72 --> 00:28:28,88
a station under the roughly where
we grandstand now. I mean we are.

330
00:28:31,24 --> 00:28:36,75
I think we i think we took advantage of the
slow ground that came right. Cool park

331
00:28:36,75 --> 00:28:42,85
down through books while back down again
and then northward from there. Yes i've

332
00:28:42,85 --> 00:28:46,90
seen that one too. Yes and the other one i
was talking about i didn't know whether

333
00:28:46,90 --> 00:28:49,97
you know think about it. And later you
don't is the earlier proposal which dated

334
00:28:49,97 --> 00:28:55,49
right back to nineteen ninety thirteen
nowhere and now i don't know.

335
00:28:57,32 --> 00:29:00,71
Oh no. In fact he dates even further back
than that because in one thousand nine.

336
00:29:01,17 --> 00:29:05,66
When there was a another
royal commission then under

337
00:29:05,67 --> 00:29:11,33
a melbourne engineer named curnow. He
proposed tunnels in all directions and the

338
00:29:11,33 --> 00:29:15,39
railway commissioners had plans for going
down to manly in all sorts of places you

339
00:29:15,39 --> 00:29:20,81
know i don't remember what i'd only get
short pants. You know it was before

340
00:29:20,81 --> 00:29:24,87
bradfield period even well no he was still
working on the designs but he got no

341
00:29:24,87 --> 00:29:31,85
credit for them. Tell me again.
Re the city railway sorry

342
00:29:31,85 --> 00:29:33,84
to harp on the police clearly you know

343
00:29:33,84 --> 00:29:38,08
a lot more about the city railway. Do you
remember the problems of which you have

344
00:29:38,08 --> 00:29:44,54
it down on the railway looking at the
construction construction of the city. I know

345
00:29:44,54 --> 00:29:51,48
we'd left. I'd left by then but it
as it is now is very similar to

346
00:29:51,48 --> 00:29:56,64
what it was intended to be well when i
was there. Do you remember those in the

347
00:29:56,64 --> 00:30:03,34
inner city line which was to cut round. I
knew about it and it was built after and

348
00:30:03,35 --> 00:30:07,58
joined in with the one that i know
would. That's more recent history you

349
00:30:13,47 --> 00:30:15,57
know but the plans. I've got

350
00:30:15,57 --> 00:30:20,92
a number of railway plans which were
during the bradfield there which must have

351
00:30:20,92 --> 00:30:26,91
been during your area and the later one
in one thousand twenty six. Which shows.

352
00:30:28,38 --> 00:30:32,67
The straight up the hill one you know when
he when they ditched the one in forty

353
00:30:32,67 --> 00:30:35,37
for the one in thirty gauge and they went
straight up in the hill. Instead of going

354
00:30:35,37 --> 00:30:38,05
in a loop. They also included

355
00:30:38,05 --> 00:30:43,75
a inner city loop which cuts down and
part of it was actually made to remember.

356
00:30:45,08 --> 00:30:51,36
It was some. Design where you
know where the rail i see

357
00:30:52,24 --> 00:30:58,68
what is going east across across circular
quay and then it ducks in under that

358
00:30:58,68 --> 00:31:03,51
headland that goes down towards under under
the conservatorium there was something

359
00:31:03,51 --> 00:31:09,99
to do with the idea of branching off
inside that. From the inside. Now

360
00:31:11,06 --> 00:31:14,70
the tunnel was built. It's it or the take
off. Is there still it was you. It was

361
00:31:14,70 --> 00:31:19,78
proposed to be used as macarthur's headquarters
bunker during the second world war

362
00:31:19,78 --> 00:31:24,56
. It was never actually used it's still
there. Exactly as it was i wasn't aware of

363
00:31:24,56 --> 00:31:31,39
that they do what i mean that was used
during the war was very low as we

364
00:31:31,40 --> 00:31:36,23
needed station at the very very low levels
when the national emergency services had

365
00:31:36,23 --> 00:31:40,37
their headquarters. I was while
i was on the i was on i was

366
00:31:40,37 --> 00:31:46,37
a departmental representative on that
conference. It was actually done. Do you know

367
00:31:46,37 --> 00:31:50,45
any of the staff there who were in
that in that everybody i know was

368
00:31:50,45 --> 00:31:50,89
a bloke called

369
00:31:50,89 --> 00:31:57,06
a ranger. And i can show you the pass that
he signed to give me access to the place

370
00:31:57,06 --> 00:32:01,19
my harry. Well i was listening
to a programme on the radio

371
00:32:01,19 --> 00:32:06,44
a little while ago and broadband i think
it was on the baby sea radio. And somebody

372
00:32:06,44 --> 00:32:11,47
was being interviewed and it was due this
right. It was judith wright the author

373
00:32:11,47 --> 00:32:17,56
and poet. And she was on the staff of this
emergency section and apparently during

374
00:32:17,56 --> 00:32:23,79
the during the days when the. Attack
by the midget submarines on sydney.
