1
00:00:01,23 --> 00:00:01,76
A play.

2
00:00:01,94 --> 00:00:03,98
Why why viewers very smart

5
00:00:23,12 --> 00:00:31,88
And the nurse delivered you and that person it. Is all in the middle.

6
00:00:32,86 --> 00:00:40,4
I have two or elder brothers and two younger brothers. Two sisters.

7

Some years ago camps are Unfortunately ours were seven in the family. He's.

8
00:00:54,15 --> 00:01:08,28
Which is the way of anything walking the walk. So there's more of them to perish. Where are worth what I was doing.

9
00:01:10,54 --> 00:01:27,12
I think I just lacked everything I love going out. Short of saying things. And point what I'm saying. Already.

10
00:01:27,81 --> 00:01:49,17
Because I just love. Everything more a lark. Now. And you can remember where he's going to go for. One round. Stop.

23
00:04:27,67 --> 00:04:41,92
In the African Americans. Thank you. That's how it all began. You know they were shining in their pocket of the. Lord.

24
00:04:42,32 --> 00:05:02,48
Which. You very much. So. Well I don't think I thought of that march. I don't think. So religion. Entered such degree.

25
00:05:02,98 --> 00:05:12,55
What I knew I would. Anyway. Is there an official big community. So I think. You know. That fell into place.

26
00:05:13,07 --> 00:05:25,38
I think I'm just for dramatic and life which say to you. And of course we're all born here.

27
00:05:25,51 --> 00:05:37,37
The rest of us who want to go on and doing a lot of. Far from here. That don't seem very new problem.

28
00:05:38,68 --> 00:05:50,11
We or us haven't half hours. Well. Or as. Didn't seem to me or anything.

29
00:05:50,36 --> 00:06:33,1
Because nothing about as dangerous much easier anyway. We thank you thank you. When. You know something about. Race.

30
00:06:42,15 --> 00:07:04,15
So. Yes. How can the Indigo. Three. Which they didn't have will certainly be. When I think I'll join the fix cause.

31
00:07:06,18 --> 00:07:31,19
You know our so. I was always interested in. The people. I know are. Now I didn't like.

32
00:07:31,75 --> 00:07:44,1
I just like going to our friends. Well I just love being there. So if I didn't have to learn. Them.

33
00:07:55,78 --> 00:08:04,58
It took a very odd sort of barrier of there with all our What in particular. But I do it because of the earth. But.

34
00:08:07,42 --> 00:08:15,45
Now I just think. I think I like sharing all of that and not remember what I did with this there are.

35
00:08:18,92 --> 00:08:35,73
Felix which was we Rick Perry. That was like. That was a little bit later. But. So. Yes I didas America fair here.

36
00:08:37,22 --> 00:08:52,67
And again by a bit of very smart. Or have we know we're still there where we were. Knew that they lived up on the Hill.

37
00:08:54,84 --> 00:08:59,14
They were here for out those farmers younger you know. What not that they were for.

38
00:08:59,38 --> 00:09:07,59
You know they're about five friends of the younger one of them. But we aren't seeing it for serious.

39
00:09:08,46 --> 00:09:21,16
And we've barely Rob. I couldn't have been more them over there because I was there. And it was my son. So I am.

00:09:22,9 --> 00:09:26,58
A guy I work actively aren't proud of my for my uncle.

41
00:09:27,44 --> 00:09:33,46
And the other while of how much he had fun with to have fun but we didn't.

42
00:09:33,54 --> 00:09:38,04
There was anything wrong here on the top of his very desire to do

43
00:09:38,04 --> 00:09:47,07
or what his sources are saying you kept secrets of it until it was the largest thought it was a natural thing to do you.

44
00:09:47,3 --> 00:09:54,74
I didn't know I was meant to sort this stuff coming out of you. And so isn't this exciting.

45
00:09:55,81 --> 00:10:08,39
You're very aware that our years. Oh years. I will remove the film that we have on our live shots of this one.

46
00:10:10,09 --> 00:10:17,04
And because you do it for us exciting and for some of your life you know it was so fun. The whole.

47
00:10:17,52 --> 00:10:30,19
The sky the journey of the special. Video. Story. Sexual experience the way. You.

48
00:10:31,8 --> 00:10:38,88
Come out of sex or so will be relevant but it can work with you know. All the way.

49
00:10:39,43 --> 00:10:48,46
Here But that's not saying much to us very. Well. When I was cruel our powers.

50
00:10:49,27 --> 00:10:58,75
About oral so this was a little bit about science about the science. It was all happening from a you know.

51
00:10:59,12 --> 00:11:12,58
I just talked to a whole group want to go there where I live give them some one description of my mother's work for.

52
00:11:14,24 --> 00:11:15,2
Things like that.

53
00:11:15,46 --> 00:11:22,39
I mean I would give them a three way Apple I could have them but something about a very large very very friendly

54
00:11:22,39 --> 00:11:35,06
and sort of. You and I were over there. We have them now. And we're driving them and out of the Civil War to get them.

55
00:11:35,08 --> 00:11:45,49
I just want some to be our friends so. I didn't walk about I want them very much French and I like them. And. I prefer.

56
00:11:47,05 --> 00:11:54,54
Really really go for it. How Yes I just saw facts that you and I did locally and where you're the person.

57
00:11:55,51 --> 00:12:04,32
I visit them or my you and are. We were. And there are so and one was how. The repairs.

58
00:12:05,42 --> 00:12:10,37
But that didn't end the current affair that didn't worry me a whole lot of a lot of.

59
00:12:13,8 --> 00:12:20,43
What I hear now you're dying to really have prayer is your life you get to school with friends and.

60
00:12:21,95 --> 00:12:31,58
They never ever mind. Providing Raman live. I have very few theories. From my friend. Chris.

61
00:12:33,41 --> 00:12:39,17
And in fact i didn't matter where they were if I lack the most of the matter WHAT they were.

62
00:12:39,7 --> 00:12:51,23
I didn't know what religion people were if you're really here. Yes or they were fearful of.

63
00:12:52,34 --> 00:12:57,38
The power of the says I'm real you know in the real world.

64
00:12:57,44 --> 00:13:03,98
Yes when I do an occasion very successful they are very successful.

65
00:13:04,52 --> 00:13:11,6
A family and I knew of his wife long before America.

66
00:13:12,19 --> 00:13:29,03
Long before him and I have to say here but when you sit there with I actually like you lots of good. We hear you. Eric.

67
00:13:30,23 --> 00:13:37,95
Very well die because of this you say you. And I were close right. You say there are five.

68
00:13:38,36 --> 00:13:51,16
Young boys or something close and I think because our houses that are closer. Where the one they've been.

69
00:13:52,88 --> 00:14:13,19
And the other one the relative. STRANGER. If I said the wrong way. Or you do. Feel guilty for a year or two or three.

70
00:14:15,22 --> 00:14:24,44
I do or mars of am. Yes. I think I might have many more to us. I thought if a man will give.

71
00:14:25,19 --> 00:14:45,41
Out surfing here for telling. Him for free. Have I made it through the first. But I face was my brother. Who may.

72
00:14:46,55 --> 00:15:03,58
I have five brother and yes. The man next to me. And. I used to sort of say where you carry the emotion.

73
00:15:03,62 --> 00:15:16,67
Oh I'm going round to see this man mind. I don't know how to go through working for each other with Marcos you know.

74
00:15:19,09 --> 00:15:23,92
Why you do and they said he shares a book some things I expect him to stick.

75
00:15:25,11 --> 00:15:33,89
Remember very well because we go away and he'd take us in oneness of time and.

76
00:15:34,6 --> 00:15:41,44
We'd never never discuss from my brother about first what he did.

77
00:15:42,35 --> 00:15:48,94
But I hate the way he would care for a child but that he was sharing a full of wonderful full.

78
00:15:49,6 --> 00:16:00,61
And it was fun as I was saying if we never discuss. A half. When we were. Here we are going to.

79
00:16:00,78 --> 00:16:09,55
It was a very exciting it was fairy fairy exciting to have this. So you have you have come back from.

80
00:16:11,3 --> 00:16:21,53
Them with a wonderful story. Well yeah Psylocke very well to go. But the environment that's out of this is.

81
00:16:22,4 --> 00:16:25,69
For the for my wife for all about the whole issue

82
00:16:25,69 --> 00:16:32,82
or from the first three that I thought House can't apply I have a copy of the globe out and I think we'll go there.

83
00:16:32,94 --> 00:16:41,02
What do you think there's anything wrong with Prince Philip. I just think it just happened.

84
00:16:41,11 --> 00:16:50,48
I think naturally but how did you start your career. Your way or look I think it happens so.

85
00:16:52,42 --> 00:16:56,74
If I didn't watch that happen. I've gone out of the room.

86
00:16:57,11 --> 00:17:05,58
It was pretty awful made through one of the few of them Hey that you've gone through it.

87
00:17:05,72 --> 00:17:08,03
Yes but then he stopped to talk to me

88
00:17:08,03 --> 00:17:16,7
but I didn't say for stop by the prophet more the longer a girl with nothing on for a year off an arm for eighteen

89
00:17:16,7 --> 00:17:24,47
months perhaps. You know. Three. Oh yes our years who didn't let me go.

90
00:17:24,58 --> 00:17:30,34
Now I was mistreated I lived with no one not even one.

91
00:17:31,17 --> 00:17:38,47
Because he didn't appear from a box that he was very current but he didn't the feel. But I.E.

92
00:17:38,47 --> 00:17:46,48
The fear of them what he was doing. We lived through your mind expanding out my understanding of.

93
00:17:47,28 --> 00:17:58,21
Having both one after that I have a very quick prayer for the other boys and so if you want to hear. And I think.

94
00:18:01,77 --> 00:18:03,96
If my driver anything over trash.

95
00:18:05,22 --> 00:18:13,04
I think he was scared he would have more drama about the weather than I was ties that you know that i hold of me

96
00:18:13,04 --> 00:18:21,41
and that these things. The boy is the future. Do you really. I just thought he'd lark to found out that.

97
00:18:24,17 --> 00:18:25,07
I was really a troll.

98
00:18:25,49 --> 00:18:29,06
If I defied the law because of what love was

99
00:18:30,18 --> 00:18:39,96
but to push back there for our looking back Mary report of what he was doing if he was very careful with the forty

100
00:18:41,8 --> 00:18:52,06
eight years he was about here. There were three. They've been there. Who Hello.

101
00:18:52,34 --> 00:18:59,45
All are no but there to my sisters and my my child of a well you know if I were of sixty

102
00:18:59,45 --> 00:19:08,33
or fifty are that they were out in May of my head. Right here and very frightened by if they were gentle and.

103
00:19:09,72 --> 00:19:13,78
And I have the comfort there are you want to say my brother to your back shortly.

104
00:19:14,48 --> 00:19:14,74
Yes

105
00:19:15,03 --> 00:19:21,95
when I go on Long Beach in the very way he will show you the full philosophic capsule avers day at the Imperial Palace.

106
00:19:22,16 --> 00:19:27,83
I'm here and I am merrier for the rakyat from the Fed put it to matter of fact.

107
00:19:27,83 --> 00:19:31,65
Go here also gentleman lies about a group you found.

108
00:19:31,85 --> 00:19:34,99
I don't know what he really is no no no nothing like that

109
00:19:34,99 --> 00:19:39,71
and I bet that the men from here it is just one of those things that happen.

110
00:19:40,43 --> 00:19:43,48
And I didn't think it was significant wrong doing.

111
00:19:43,49 --> 00:19:51,4
If you from your review you and I because I thought this was something of the wrong person from longs for me.

112
00:19:51,59 --> 00:20:02,21
This is my little thing. Because of course I did not know that he was doing it for my brother. I only saw this.

113
00:20:04,71 --> 00:20:09,27
But I thought for this day you have to leave the last of me doing out there you know.

114
00:20:10,48 --> 00:20:16,81
Best he said just above the full time but I didn't.

115
00:20:18,28 --> 00:20:29,57
I never worried about I was very selfish for a while over here so they're here start to figure this belongs to my young

116
00:20:29,57 --> 00:20:38,93
birds or something out of my secret with some of this. If you figure for the money so long as you move a little.

117
00:20:40,31 --> 00:20:48,17
In our work because. Well either way you never discuss Postal thing.

118
00:20:48,9 --> 00:20:53,08
You go with my mouth and from where I work you do a chorus of

119
00:20:53,08 --> 00:21:01,55
or something to them for something wrong to me I felt my my not sacred. But I do know you'll now go for it.

120
00:21:03,2 --> 00:21:10,26
Now girl because I enjoyed it. Except a little in the mid nineties they see it as many. You see people here anyway.

121
00:21:10,27 --> 00:21:17,98
Rather wild life out there guilty I would love them back there. For more don't you know it but you know.

122
00:21:18,47 --> 00:21:30,73
Five of them are filthy. Because I enjoyed it. How did you actually get sixty five. So there was no line.

123
00:21:30,8 --> 00:21:41,57
Facts are my ideas come from there ever ever were never discussed. Never discussed and from a big family.

124
00:21:41,89 --> 00:21:53,24
Of them I said think of this so often for men to care for all the free world.

125
00:21:55,64 --> 00:22:00,6
So school school who it was a whole crew for.

126
00:22:01,43 --> 00:22:09,77
I think it all happened naturally when you put your car wash you back for one hour now.

127
00:22:09,77 --> 00:22:13,31
I thought I was special about then I was a marketable forth

128
00:22:13,31 --> 00:22:25,05
and we never used to work cooperatively with us from fear of the word I meant that you were never swore you know.

129
00:22:25,1 --> 00:22:33,15
What do you think about just having a best president this time having sex.

130
00:22:33,47 --> 00:22:42,78
That you would want to go to all year just to do work or you wouldn't say getting off because getting our lives.

131
00:22:42,79 --> 00:22:53,77
Much later. Much like. A fracture and a marriage just so you know all of the.

132
00:22:54,79 --> 00:23:07,68
Very little kids talk about my I have a nice season with a you. Right. But the road. Now or Never.

133
00:23:07,82 --> 00:23:15,05
You know like it will. Find and the arc here where I come from.

134
00:23:15,45 --> 00:23:19,01
I wasn't terribly of that sort of thing I want to be for us.

135
00:23:19,1 --> 00:23:28,18
Are selfish and I just went about my business and the critics were. Right. It was kind of.

136
00:23:28,56 --> 00:23:40,49
The one you mention the rule if you get to where I just sort of a mob this is big three. And.

137
00:23:41,12 --> 00:23:48,11
Just growing with all these figures are it proceeded from a for a while before so much real that it was all very nice

138
00:23:48,11 --> 00:23:55,18
going to magically a really good big deal to make this beautiful faces. Yes I would take some.

139
00:23:55,8 --> 00:24:06,18
If you were waiting for your call. But what there were. Yes I still think if after this. You write the three.

140
00:24:07,85 --> 00:24:26,33
In the middle of somebody's back yards away. The middle of the. Cohesiveness of. The room you will.

141
00:24:28,48 --> 00:24:46,29
I suppose if it is a theory that you will go in your one way or the. Or I think. The mouth of. All of our years will.

142
00:24:47,24 --> 00:24:57,85
Home already knowing. Another something quite have the comfort of my own little. Say that for my own. Almost sacred.

143
00:24:58,71 --> 00:25:04,65
For my fish and I feel so far from the river.

144
00:25:05,91 --> 00:25:14,84
Right there with you from the same way of life that will live there but what you're doing here.

145
00:25:14,9 --> 00:25:23,83
Dr Yes And you know now back to the ever since the turn off of Earth where I was you and I

146
00:25:23,83 --> 00:25:29,66

179
00:30:01,86 --> 00:30:14,43
It's a question of the legs of the fallen by working fall from the bush. Far away all of that didn't make me.

183
00:30:59,97 --> 00:31:13,22
And my father was a bit of a false if he was going to talk really about. You first his house from his house.

184
00:31:13,52 --> 00:31:37,86
You from the mouth. How much money was not coming out of the rooms I think all. One. But everybody about my mouth.

Apart from everybody. For the rest of us NASCAR. If you're very cool cool cool what you think of it.

186
00:31:55,54 --> 00:32:00,53
I think that was just a matter of course very regular you know getting on with their lives and.

187
00:32:01,16 --> 00:32:11,6
Crock of shit over here. I was mad about I went right. I was very shitty for work and I have a killer set.

188
00:32:12,58 --> 00:32:17,22
I want to go over and over and over but I was never man about.

189
00:32:23,46 --> 00:32:31,72
If you haven't got it all and I think we did it because you went to primary school.

190
00:32:33,37 --> 00:32:46,45
And then from Prime Minister with six or so. Then you work out your wish. For you to go. With you very very little.

191
00:32:47,21 --> 00:32:55,15
And I was there. And I was I'm so you are. I'm not sure when you're.

192
00:32:55,55 --> 00:33:10,13
OK at school even though you have a tree a longer one can reverse to go do it you know I hate this very well you are

193
00:33:10,13 --> 00:33:15,88
just hated still getting large here or there and I didn't. My friends of anybody.

194
00:33:15,88 --> 00:33:26,19
I didn't think there were others out there were very high just so I went to school because I had to go to school.

195
00:33:26,38 --> 00:33:37,51
If I could get I'm sure it will all work. And I know we didn't know where you or you go.

196
00:33:37,61 --> 00:33:45,37
So you know that we feel lonely.

197
00:33:45,59 --> 00:34:00,31
But only after we didn't have the right group those who really care most about you will have your OK because you have

198
00:34:00,31 --> 00:34:08,99
to do. Thank you. I mean are you from are swimming pretty far from a great source of workmen a big deal by doing good.

199
00:34:09,16 --> 00:34:14,22
Do you really think recently. This is really a gray.

200
00:34:14,4 --> 00:34:21,24
Well that's right and wrong when I was in the Army and I never got out of the well I never got out.

201
00:34:22,39 --> 00:34:33,2
Good luck to have a good clue to get back in the car getting ready to do one of the around those two it was working

202
00:34:33,2 --> 00:34:42,34
fine in the field with a bunch of practical. It's nice. Thank you for all. If you do if you like.

203
00:34:42,39 --> 00:34:52,48
We say the focus was outside the school which is. Great. If you go so high I think just being at home.

204
00:34:53,05 --> 00:35:02,38
Crowds of sisters. Going out. For a good question because we've got a lot of that.

205
00:35:02,59 --> 00:35:10,97
What it takes for picnics he'd take us. Dry you know and I first have to we're going to go through Florida.

206
00:35:11,95 --> 00:35:16,2
Case from our place.

207
00:35:16,79 --> 00:35:18,72
We've got a few Wicked Witch Fire way

208
00:35:18,72 --> 00:35:25,66
and I remember it very back is a boarding house little coffee one time people were going off here.

209
00:35:28,22 --> 00:35:35,28
They were laughing and I think a courthouse on the veranda with a good will carry you through it. Yes.

210
00:35:35,93 --> 00:35:47,43
And away some question. Should we bring. Here special saying you know it's all about. It's very difficult.

211
00:35:48,76 --> 00:35:54,19
You get here but you are my father where we are preparing

212
00:35:54,19 --> 00:36:06,25

213
00:36:08,29 --> 00:36:18,34
Even years now. We just go up there for the day and have you learned very very fair play.

214
00:36:20,41 --> 00:36:28,27
Of those so please grow your writing. So there's your view of your theory.

215
00:36:29,29 --> 00:36:38,87
Far after all that you are going to if you're a good little kid will you feel of power. Yes or that we will every day.

216
00:36:39,23 --> 00:36:51,13
I wonder if you really know what. Well we all have different frames usually having it all the time.

217
00:36:51,2 --> 00:37:02,61
And actually in the process. This will make up for my family when we can go elsewhere.

218
00:37:03,38 --> 00:37:15,23
After all without saying your crush is a problem. Where my sis is a year so absolutely right. What it is but yeah.

219
00:37:16,05 --> 00:37:32,95
Here's. The rules we're very you know how. We have a way with our. Where are they all are over ninety dollars a year.

220

221
00:37:42,84 --> 00:37:58,93
Well we have now are going to hear much about right here. And. A fair fight. We just have to really get along.

222
00:38:02,08 --> 00:38:11,5
In the locus of the room to go. Isn't her school. For you. When it first. This is very much as far as the go.

223
00:38:12,3 --> 00:38:22,7
Oh yes because friends. Who normally sit and laugh with me or you know certainly do it for a short.

224
00:38:23,81 --> 00:38:27,94
Call went by and then half way at the moment.

225
00:38:29,98 --> 00:38:36,97
You walk in the road will go I feel like well before that we had we been in Bellevue.

226
00:38:37,02 --> 00:38:42,59
You know their feelings for you and there was a smaller house but the first sunk A levels

227
00:38:42,59 --> 00:38:56,07
and we rolled out for years before it was just a river. And that was for our mouse and luckily our. I'm out of the car.

228
00:38:57,62 --> 00:39:04,41
And so have the truckers house with the road and.

229
00:39:05,72 --> 00:39:11,77
People there but when you're young you don't care where you are you're just over there you go you go along

230
00:39:11,77 --> 00:39:18,38
and you're thinking this where I'm going to do what I did not do it. You just fifteen. If you're a long year.

231
00:39:18,61 --> 00:39:28,43
I dare say. When are you at your school. You were you were. Before I was outta here and you know all.

232
00:39:29,41 --> 00:39:40,41
And I had friends who want to go. Well that one of those things happened. You know. There was a clue to grow.

233
00:39:40,52 --> 00:39:50,76
You know how was the start for about after hours about. The hours of. Six thirty.

234
00:39:52,81 --> 00:40:02,44
Now are there certain to say we were just don't wake up our. Get fresh. Yes. If you think about it.

235
00:40:06,92 --> 00:40:17,24
Are now arguing for money they have to have thought it was crap and that. If you lack something.

236
00:40:17,36 --> 00:40:22,71
There's nothing wrong with that to say if you die or clock in sync or there's something wrong. Having fun.

237
00:40:24,07 --> 00:40:36,8
But I liked it and he was very nice. I remember. One other theory that he was a well.

238
00:40:38,76 --> 00:40:48,47
And I have been just see here you were in the fashion business for good with scalar problem.

239
00:40:48,95 --> 00:40:58,37
Do you think I have do you very practical or or I have to go down to them

240
00:40:58,37 --> 00:41:04,86
and get some from you all for one know who the better jobs are here

241
00:41:04,86 --> 00:41:14,64
or there were where I don't have to have a system most days in market place. Or a part time work.

242
00:41:14,7 --> 00:41:23,9
I have it nice or so for you there.

243
00:41:24,00 --> 00:41:36,78
Buy me a box and say well I'm here to have a guy there are some very nice to have to share you with us.

244
00:41:36,91 --> 00:41:47,93
Do you ever track to people with those you know they're all going to hook it all and have about a ten.

245
00:41:48,73 --> 00:42:03,51
There were in your group. Yes but I didn't know I just moved so obvious I didn't think there is a bigger car. You know.

246
00:42:04,03 --> 00:42:12,9
And yes they are very busy. But that if I didn't look at it every day I was there. And I watch out for them.

247
00:42:14,13 --> 00:42:21,96
Are you the woman that if you have dinner with your mother go on. So we're very very not horses so there is no sound.

248
00:42:22,64 --> 00:42:32,17
And you will never buy them. All and it was a very. Well I'm going to do.

249
00:42:34,74 --> 00:42:45,12
If you don't say what I wish I knew immediately. So it was sixty sixty. I didn't want it I screw with my choice.

250
00:42:46,05 --> 00:42:53,44
You know my account of what I mean to the year from probably how. All of a sort of you would you buy me things.

251
00:42:54,32 --> 00:43:04,67
And things are going to pay for my house. Now so we work really really really really you have to have a profession.

252
00:43:07,15 --> 00:43:20,17
If you will but if you go. If you. Where all are very severe. But if you go you know where you are all.

253
00:43:20,69 --> 00:43:32,16
Are working in just a few of their fashion apparently to pick up a whole thing of the sort of our beautiful son we were.

254
00:43:33,29 --> 00:43:44,57
I think I learnt the horrors. But I think it was really easy it was starting out fairly to. I saw her. Yes.

255
00:43:45,74 --> 00:44:00,52
Yes yes I did locker room. We wound up working with our long long hours of hours. There are a long road how jocose we.

256
00:44:00,78 --> 00:44:08,45
And I always have to go away. Hot round messages and say hello.

257
00:44:09,17 --> 00:44:18,14
Do other things and help around the room to the other you will. It's amazing. If it's a new one when you can watch.

258
00:44:18,68 --> 00:44:28,41
Part of the march with. The full mark. And if you like it if you lack of sync seem to get that far and.

259
00:44:28,49 --> 00:44:37,53
One of them ever remember. Some particular stood for because you are a good. Girl.

260
00:44:38,33 --> 00:44:44,55
Here you are the good girl the girl the more you know we do it because you know you.

261
00:44:45,49 --> 00:44:54,39
Certainly we're going to we're going. Now I have to buy some because we already have.

262
00:44:54,5 --> 00:45:02,98
Captain did that I never go there. I might have a. Walk through or in queue to do it.

263
00:45:03,08 --> 00:45:09,57
With some growth what was previously. I think reasonably Yes I didn't really want to look like.

264
00:45:09,87 --> 00:45:25,72
What I think the commercial value in. The rule of the rule. Whatever short of a. Time for the rose.

265
00:45:26,16 --> 00:45:39,37
Listener and you heard it here so far. Of working with your love the most universal approach. I have are the house.

266
00:45:40,42 --> 00:45:52,53
About the house. That you're probably going to favorite place I go to work early. The thing.

267
00:45:52,96 --> 00:46:13,38
The Windows Phone because I feel this is all yet. Complete with. Well. OK. But for long. So if you are in the home.

268
00:46:13,76 --> 00:46:21,2
And know that ours is trying to have health care for whatever care cringe. You have to know.

269
00:46:22,46 --> 00:46:32,59
Somebody really never show which was good and I you just social welfare for the service are far

270
00:46:32,62 --> 00:46:36,52
and if I met some of the guys that Bush could benefit me I'd give it back.

271
00:46:37,25 --> 00:46:45,3
I would just go to do you have one who is really more agree with you here.

272
00:46:47,53 --> 00:46:52,14
But if we didn't care then we where we took our welfare all out to school now.

273
00:46:52,23 --> 00:47:05,42
On the ground for free when your throat was over and. In our pocket I have it right here. So you know we have a right.

274
00:47:05,46 --> 00:47:23,16
We may talk about the pay roll. We have in fact earlier you are now in my mouth where you were never on. That list.

275
00:47:23,2 --> 00:47:29,93
You were going over there and I was feeling lonely. When it took me a pitiful four hours to get you to look out for me.

276
00:47:30,02 --> 00:47:45,36
All right. I will be with you all. I have to do our network of long time. Well. When I asked for a psycho. At the time.

277
00:47:45,6 --> 00:47:53,42
Good I knew I had it good will surely say who it was I you there when I should hear myself.

278
00:47:54,82 --> 00:48:09,95
Have a member of the rivers with regular flu. Not really. You have a much bigger the use of power. You know.

279
00:48:10,19 --> 00:48:19,52
In fact about that. I'm upset. And I have a car. In the strike three you like the car.

280
00:48:20,01 --> 00:48:29,31
So if you thought you were talking about this or that it's like oh you know you should run for it

281
00:48:29,31 --> 00:48:37,37
and he would do us your. Yes I don't know if you. So I was very friendly with John Williams. For you.

282
00:48:37,44 --> 00:48:49,64
If you're going to do it if you can. It depends a good book on where you must carry and how much more you.

283
00:48:50,11 --> 00:48:58,6
Room for years and he I had a lovely house. Have a market where the hell's happened.

284
00:48:59,04 --> 00:49:07,67
And we have this out there and I have a tennis court. So are ours about something like this and I was right.

285
00:49:07,73 --> 00:49:19,6
And I are right about. That. He was shaking. And it was. And she goes home.

286
00:49:20,38 --> 00:49:33,73
You know me I'm sure you'll check your withdrawal. He was a bit of about how his father was the problem here and I.

287
00:49:33,74 --> 00:49:36,09
