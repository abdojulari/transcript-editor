1
00:00:03,29 --> 00:00:12,81
You know you might feel no need to mention on the radio when you are a little bit

2
00:00:12,81 --> 00:00:31,34
and you say oh I was told I just gave you a story of my give me do you go.

3
00:00:31,34 --> 00:00:34,96
She told me he's sorry what do you think Michael said

4
00:00:34,96 --> 00:00:46,05
but they will argue with you about you really contributing to the loan.

5
00:00:46,06 --> 00:00:57,19
Doing something they enjoy that he will be for me this being your home right here in this recession to get the word

6
00:00:57,19 --> 00:01:07,76
lightly on your right side go straight.

7
00:01:07,77 --> 00:01:22,52
We'll look at this like you see that it isn't said much here in the situation here because I mean it's a good thing to

8
00:01:22,52 --> 00:01:26,44
say Are you crazy. And it was actually pretty funny.

9
00:01:26,57 --> 00:01:29,07
What one of the things are slowly

10
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:42,28
but with a train here is that if you will strike straight down the songs I mean if you make the train cars pretty a

11
00:01:42,28 --> 00:01:54,59
little bit more or less true here that's really really really what it said but I truly believe. Oh yes.

12
00:01:55,01 --> 00:02:11,53
Or maybe yes yes and it was in the right. Especially if your brother was not here.

13
00:02:14,33 --> 00:02:39,95
So they didn't want their picture but with all your mind that there is just over my shoulder with his shoulder.

14
00:02:39,95 --> 00:02:42,1
Yes I see this.

15
00:02:42,15 --> 00:03:05,06
This is this guy here she had a great write up to get you know he was a pleasure to work with the way you live

16
00:03:05,06 --> 00:03:25,14
but I see what Larry here about six years.

17
00:03:25,24 --> 00:03:48,61
Oh he would write about this right now in front of the little boy you're old enough to hear it was really ready to go.

18
00:03:48,7 --> 00:04:02,05
I mean you can still feel like going well if he was all the way here.

19
00:04:02,41 --> 00:04:30,51
Get a hold of this boy if one knew he was if he was real life Jimmy Jimmy Carter that you know I'm sure he would do the

20
00:04:30,51 --> 00:04:44,21
plate races that you'll see that I'm sure the place for me will be specially if we get the yellow bottles

21
00:04:44,21 --> 00:05:03,39
and yes OK Do you know this he was absolutely. He was a good looking. Well I mean I don't like to hear you.

22
00:05:04,04 --> 00:05:25,1
Even though you're with us. I'm just hearing some of the oh yes. You wouldn't be able to really leverage. Yeah right.

23
00:05:25,31 --> 00:06:22,4
He was saying you're right the city where from. Oh yes. Did you come to Sydney to get yourself here. That's right.

24
00:06:22,89 --> 00:06:34,49
Well I think we'd better make sure it was really very fulfilling it's really very well where they are getting the good

25
00:06:37,97 --> 00:06:42,77
life. Dr Elizabeth tested. GEORGE NEGUS Yeah exactly.

26
00:06:43,12 --> 00:06:50,45
Are you enjoying much this week we're sorry you didn't get here just like you did to get anyone else.

27
00:06:50,5 --> 00:06:52,59
Yeah you lose your brain

28
00:06:52,59 --> 00:06:58,12
when you feel you want to be really really I mean one of the people we're just getting people who feel relaxed.

29
00:06:58,37 --> 00:07:05,83
That's right here along here. What is your problem.

30
00:07:05,99 --> 00:07:22,66
Here's a program visual Well look I guess if you just see what the heroes look like here look at the Joan right

31
00:07:22,66 --> 00:07:33,38
or the close up of the right. It's just really this is a boy story we're very curious.

32
00:07:33,39 --> 00:07:38,75
I just let it show that he was not how it was this is the record we do.

33
00:07:38,79 --> 00:07:48,64
Really really well run says he did this it was Riley was writing tells the victim to because it would be just a really

34
00:07:48,64 --> 00:07:59,21
really good script but he was used to talking to be entertaining and he would cross talk to feel right.

35
00:07:59,22 --> 00:08:01,83
And he must've felt really ridiculous.

36
00:08:02,22 --> 00:08:10,05
And it was a tale of zero eight zero nine just on that night and they put it into a dramatic fall because he could.

37
00:08:10,05 --> 00:08:16,31
I'm judging by the think that if you make me illiterate believe it or of the drug. Yeah you know me. Oh no.

38
00:08:16,34 --> 00:08:25,01
And it can't be a little old right in here a lot of people can fool some of the really nice living ten meters behind

39
00:08:25,01 --> 00:08:29,75
the man right here but honestly this is a ton of it was thrilling

40
00:08:29,75 --> 00:08:39,73
and I love it a little bit like a little boy here I know I mean because it might This is for me it was bad for you

41
00:08:39,73 --> 00:08:44,57
and good night from Hollywood this riles on this shelf that you write.
