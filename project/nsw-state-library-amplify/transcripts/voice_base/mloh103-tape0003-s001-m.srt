1
00:00:12,11 --> 00:00:14,47
Yes.

2
00:00:15,74 --> 00:00:22,54
So in 1974 i was living in your
ella in the us new england plateau.

3
00:00:23,05 --> 00:00:26,59
And lots of people travelling from.

4
00:00:26,61 --> 00:00:30,56
From nimbin to sydney
would go by the back road

5
00:00:30,56 --> 00:00:34,35
and stay at our place overnight so i
was to get lots of news about what was

6
00:00:34,35 --> 00:00:39,45
happening in them and the setting up
a ton of bull and it was part of me

7
00:00:40,21 --> 00:00:43,06
that wanted to go back and
feel the promise that we made

8
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:46,17
that the public meeting
we said that said that.

9
00:00:47,62 --> 00:00:50,89
That name and the queerest vessel would
bring young people back to the town

10
00:00:50,89 --> 00:00:54,36
and repopulate the area and revitalize it.

11
00:00:54,54 --> 00:00:59,22
And it's turned into a slogan
by the architecture students

12
00:00:59,22 --> 00:01:04,22
that we would recycle member and
we would recycle a town. And.

13
00:01:04,24 --> 00:01:06,83
I could see it was happening and slowly.

14
00:01:08,30 --> 00:01:11,34
So i wanted to go along and five it up so.

15
00:01:12,78 --> 00:01:19,45
We got an invitation from a group called
the educational smorgasbord which was

16
00:01:19,45 --> 00:01:22,75
going to base the balance
and there's a gordon lang

17
00:01:22,75 --> 00:01:26,24
that retired primary school teacher got
some money from the schools commission at

18
00:01:26,24 --> 00:01:31,05
that stage to develop community
learning and we had some expertise at

19
00:01:31,05 --> 00:01:33,92
that from the the festival
the learning exchange

20
00:01:33,92 --> 00:01:35,98
that happened at the festival
we had a model for doing that.

21
00:01:37,22 --> 00:01:41,80
So rather than take its job as an individual
i formed a partnership with a couple

22
00:01:41,80 --> 00:01:44,98
of people including in chance.

23
00:01:46,23 --> 00:01:50,51
Who was the site manager at the festival
the guy most responsible for the physical.

24
00:01:50,91 --> 00:01:56,76
Works on the festival. We formed a company
called the reality construction company.

25
00:01:57,54 --> 00:02:02,31
And our job was to go and. You
know. Turn myths into reality.

26
00:02:02,79 --> 00:02:07,09
We're going to create this new
community new futures in nimbin

27
00:02:08,66 --> 00:02:12,67
and we're all about flash and
flair and doing it with style

28
00:02:12,67 --> 00:02:15,51
and sort of a feeling

29
00:02:15,51 --> 00:02:22,11
that nimbin would come a
bit too gumboot you know

30
00:02:22,81 --> 00:02:25,43
sort of lost in the mud
because i mean limits say

31
00:02:25,43 --> 00:02:27,69
that the people who found it tangible

32
00:02:28,46 --> 00:02:30,23
and did so under the most
horrendous conditions

33
00:02:30,23 --> 00:02:36,45
that 50 people living in a single house you
know in the heaviest rains for you know

34
00:02:36,45 --> 00:02:37,63
sort of 20 years.

35
00:02:39,41 --> 00:02:40,14
It was desperate times

36
00:02:40,14 --> 00:02:44,09
and no money no money to do any
development work to buy the tools

37
00:02:44,09 --> 00:02:50,23
and materials you know like and lots of
madness and lots of mad people coming in.

38
00:02:50,23 --> 00:02:52,45
Plugging in and wanting help
and it was kind of stuff.

39
00:02:52,57 --> 00:02:58,87
Also cites you know this strange mixture
of pioneers and parasites and sites

40
00:02:58,88 --> 00:03:04,64
and paranoid. You know like weird
stuff. The vision it collected.

41
00:03:05,69 --> 00:03:07,11
So we came back to nimbin

42
00:03:07,11 --> 00:03:11,60
and first we sort of caressed
into nimbin lethargy people.

43
00:03:12,52 --> 00:03:15,35
And the company was working
kind of blew apart.

44
00:03:15,76 --> 00:03:18,14
The reality construction company
never actually got the name

45
00:03:18,14 --> 00:03:22,25
and blew apart in lennox ed gordon
lang wouldn't let us set up in them

46
00:03:22,25 --> 00:03:26,31
and because he didn't want to be
polluted by the aquarius dream.

47
00:03:26,50 --> 00:03:29,57
We want to get occasional smorgasbord
to be seen as kind of straight.

48
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:33,90
It was kind of ironic the only people
interested in these new ideas were the

49
00:03:33,90 --> 00:03:37,50
hippies of course but so it was.

50
00:03:37,52 --> 00:03:41,27
We did a couple of good things including
tour the yellow brick road shows.

51
00:03:41,46 --> 00:03:45,59
Nigel triffitt sort of
fear an education piece.

52
00:03:46,80 --> 00:03:49,17
Anyway would blow apart and
i ended up living in them

53
00:03:49,17 --> 00:03:53,15
and again working with my partner.

54
00:03:53,17 --> 00:03:58,68
On community development and what what
became obvious to us immediately was that.

55
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,49
What we'd taken for granted.

56
00:04:01,87 --> 00:04:06,02
While organizing the quest queries
festival had been forgotten.

57
00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:07,29
People for example didn't know

58
00:04:07,29 --> 00:04:11,14
that you could hire the hall to have a
public meeting you know there's so much

59
00:04:11,14 --> 00:04:14,31
antagonism a grown up between the people
who stayed after the festival on the

60
00:04:14,31 --> 00:04:17,80
townspeople at the festival
the community services

61
00:04:17,80 --> 00:04:23,84
that were seen things being withheld
and not available to people so.

62
00:04:23,86 --> 00:04:30,29
We realised that building this community
was going to be grassroots work and.

63
00:04:30,31 --> 00:04:35,28
And the beginning of it was like just
learning how to have meetings again learning

64
00:04:35,28 --> 00:04:36,82
how to have community meetings.

65
00:04:37,82 --> 00:04:39,95
One of the legacies of the
queerest festival was

66
00:04:39,95 --> 00:04:45,24
that the festival had acquired
property in the main street of nimbin.

67
00:04:46,10 --> 00:04:49,32
I mention the rs sell whole have
been purchased by the festival and

68
00:04:49,32 --> 00:04:51,96
that was sold after the festival
to a group of people who said

69
00:04:51,96 --> 00:04:53,48
that they were going to stay behind

70
00:04:53,48 --> 00:04:56,96
and you know some of them were
already owning property and

71
00:04:57,76 --> 00:05:01,60
that the building would be there for
community function and we ensured

72
00:05:01,60 --> 00:05:06,38
that there was a sufficient spread of
owners that can never be sold. Right.

73
00:05:06,41 --> 00:05:08,29
No one everyone had to agree to sell it

74
00:05:08,29 --> 00:05:14,19
and there's no way these people would
ever agree the rainbow cafe the lease

75
00:05:14,19 --> 00:05:18,56
and the rainbow cafe was extended and taken
up by the tangible force cooperative

76
00:05:19,27 --> 00:05:20,03
and.

77
00:05:20,05 --> 00:05:25,44
My partner had purchased the tomato sauce
battery which was an old general store in

78
00:05:25,44 --> 00:05:26,10
the main street

79
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:31,08
and these people these buildings were
all of a level for community business

80
00:05:31,81 --> 00:05:35,26
particularly for the new settlers.

81
00:05:35,28 --> 00:05:38,00
This contrast of what was
happening over at main arm

82
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:41,33
and mullumbimby where the people had
settled in the hills in the main valley

83
00:05:41,33 --> 00:05:45,95
and around there and had no presence
to speak of in the town name

84
00:05:45,96 --> 00:05:50,13
and always always had a shopfront
present for the new settlers now

85
00:05:50,14 --> 00:05:55,64
and this was an advantage for the early
community development organisation because

86
00:05:55,64 --> 00:05:59,80
we had a central place to
organise services from the.

87
00:06:00,84 --> 00:06:05,80
The the media factory which is what we
call the aerosol hole became a healing

88
00:06:05,80 --> 00:06:08,05
center and swear. Carol.

89
00:06:08,47 --> 00:06:14,97
Norman stannard in the first acupuncture
practice on the north coast massages was

90
00:06:14,97 --> 00:06:17,21
offered there and herbal treatments

91
00:06:17,21 --> 00:06:21,71
and also it became the centre for
organising the birth and beyond group.

92
00:06:22,87 --> 00:06:25,17
The home birthing unit that came later.

93
00:06:26,94 --> 00:06:31,03
Well we sat in the back of the media factory
in had the first meetings of what was

94
00:06:31,03 --> 00:06:34,66
to become the home builders
association because they came aware

95
00:06:34,66 --> 00:06:40,71
that the zoning the lands owning was not
what people wanted people want to divide

96
00:06:40,71 --> 00:06:43,24
land and allow other people
to build houses on it.

97
00:06:45,45 --> 00:06:47,77
So there was lots of land
available very cheaply

98
00:06:48,48 --> 00:06:52,63
but the zoning required you can only
build one house behind hectares.

99
00:06:52,93 --> 00:06:58,68
Now people are already building their
houses by 74 on these properties

100
00:06:58,68 --> 00:06:59,53
and are illegal.

101
00:07:00,49 --> 00:07:03,70
So the home builders association was
formed to negotiate with the council about

102
00:07:03,70 --> 00:07:07,55
changing the zoning and.

103
00:07:07,57 --> 00:07:12,34
The first meeting so this home builders
association were about learning how to have

104
00:07:12,34 --> 00:07:15,90
meetings and this was critical
because what had happened was

105
00:07:15,90 --> 00:07:18,21
that everyone had a piece of the dream

106
00:07:18,96 --> 00:07:23,83
that had been seeded by the aquarius
festival but no forum for it.

107
00:07:23,90 --> 00:07:25,36
So when the forum was created.

108
00:07:25,47 --> 00:07:28,42
Everyone came more or less
vomited their frustration

109
00:07:28,42 --> 00:07:32,88
and their dream onto the meeting there was
lots of talk but no listening. Right.

110
00:07:33,95 --> 00:07:38,05
So we had to work very hard at
establishing ways of having meetings

111
00:07:38,05 --> 00:07:40,41
and basically the format
of sitting in a circle.

112
00:07:40,45 --> 00:07:46,04
I have introductions everyone spoke went
round the circle everyone spoke introduced

113
00:07:46,04 --> 00:07:47,72
themselves and said what
they were at the meeting for

114
00:07:48,44 --> 00:07:50,48
and then we would set the
agenda from what had come up

115
00:07:51,24 --> 00:07:56,45
and then we would talk
right. And just require.

116
00:07:56,47 --> 00:07:59,73
Some moderation as a whole argument
that structure was a possible.

117
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:01,78
The chairman i can stuff quickly.

118
00:08:02,17 --> 00:08:03,70
You know sharing it round

119
00:08:03,70 --> 00:08:07,23
but basically there was someone who
said you're speaking too much.

120
00:08:07,27 --> 00:08:10,44
We got you and said i think someone
took responsibility for the meeting.

121
00:08:12,65 --> 00:08:14,25
Now having established the rules

122
00:08:14,25 --> 00:08:20,56
and having established the process of
listening to people we moved very quickly.

123
00:08:20,58 --> 00:08:25,74
And the home builders association was an
enormously successful negotiating body.

124
00:08:25,89 --> 00:08:27,47
We got membership.

125
00:08:27,83 --> 00:08:28,87
All over the place i mean

126
00:08:29,71 --> 00:08:33,58
but one of the stories about the home
builders association like all good voluntary

127
00:08:33,58 --> 00:08:37,53
associations we needed some money to spend
so we said we'd have to have a benefit

128
00:08:37,53 --> 00:08:41,53
concert. We had the benefit concert
we realised there are no musicians.

129
00:08:41,80 --> 00:08:45,72
You know chris introduced not to
musicians together into the area

130
00:08:45,72 --> 00:08:47,09
but they weren't playing together.

131
00:08:47,67 --> 00:08:51,80
So we only had a couple of people
singing songs will get us you know

132
00:08:52,65 --> 00:08:54,66
but it's still a good thing but out of

133
00:08:54,66 --> 00:08:58,69
that result we've got to do something about
the music and this is also a priority.

134
00:08:59,93 --> 00:09:06,28
So i was we were approached by a group
who want to set up a folk club in

135
00:09:06,28 --> 00:09:09,53
tomato sauce and we said wacko this
is just what we've been waiting for.

136
00:09:09,55 --> 00:09:12,79
So we you know my partner and i threw
our support behind the folklore

137
00:09:13,80 --> 00:09:17,67
and the folk club. Took off like
a rocket always people came out

138
00:09:17,67 --> 00:09:19,65
and started playing the music together.

139
00:09:19,67 --> 00:09:23,08
And listening to each other and forming
new combinations and we hurting

140
00:09:23,08 --> 00:09:28,46
and practicing and bringing new
songs to the to the. Folk club.

141
00:09:28,54 --> 00:09:32,49
Suddenly there was a flowering
of music in them and.

142
00:09:33,53 --> 00:09:33,63
So

143
00:09:33,64 --> 00:09:38,15
when we came to do the next benefit homebuilt
association which was only like three

144
00:09:38,15 --> 00:09:39,06
months down the track.

145
00:09:39,11 --> 00:09:43,03
We had five different combinations of
musicians fighting for the states you know

146
00:09:43,03 --> 00:09:45,26
this is all voluntary we have
people saying ok we want to fly.

147
00:09:45,28 --> 00:09:49,71
We've rehearsed this for the
home builders association.

148
00:09:49,72 --> 00:09:53,35
So that was the kind of organisation
was going on at the time and the name

149
00:09:53,35 --> 00:09:56,08
and news were started up the
name news was sort of a romeo.

150
00:09:57,84 --> 00:10:04,06
To cap staple publication. When
we introduced rules which were.

151
00:10:04,08 --> 00:10:05,75
No censorship.

152
00:10:05,77 --> 00:10:09,96
You could say what you like but you
had to put your name on it at home.

153
00:10:10,10 --> 00:10:13,08
What you wrote arguing that.

154
00:10:13,10 --> 00:10:14,74
That village was so small

155
00:10:14,74 --> 00:10:19,34
that you know people would get immediate
feedback they sound outrageous from the

156
00:10:19,34 --> 00:10:20,63
people they'd offended. We could afford

157
00:10:20,63 --> 00:10:24,99
and since it had no capital we didn't we
weren't obligated by the defamation laws

158
00:10:24,99 --> 00:10:27,62
or anything like that. You
know no one was at risk.

159
00:10:28,80 --> 00:10:29,84
All the individuals be at risk

160
00:10:29,84 --> 00:10:32,76
but certainly not the
publication of assets of zero

161
00:10:33,91 --> 00:10:39,63
and the name in news was the most fascinating
publication i had seen at the time i

162
00:10:39,63 --> 00:10:43,92
had been the editor of student publications
we get the strangest you know mad

163
00:10:43,92 --> 00:10:47,22
reynolds and sort of birth notices

164
00:10:47,22 --> 00:10:50,94
that people calling their
self mango sunshine.

165
00:10:50,99 --> 00:10:55,55
Mango sunshine and things like this with
the most delightful news. But appearing.

166
00:10:57,12 --> 00:10:59,84
And always incredibly immediate
and this used to come out weekly

167
00:10:59,84 --> 00:11:05,06
and i was enormously bonding thing so the
homos association had in effect had its

168
00:11:05,06 --> 00:11:06,42
own news organ

169
00:11:06,42 --> 00:11:09,77
that got out to all the people building
about what was happening with the

170
00:11:09,77 --> 00:11:14,47
negotiations which started with the council
not my own feeling was as soon as we

171
00:11:14,47 --> 00:11:17,15
had established a negotiation
with the council.

172
00:11:17,22 --> 00:11:19,31
We were certainly going to win right.

173
00:11:19,41 --> 00:11:22,43
So soon as we'd certainly negotiate and
home builders put out to everyone.

174
00:11:22,51 --> 00:11:23,26
Start building.

175
00:11:23,49 --> 00:11:27,64
You know we would like crazy because
everything built will be approved.

176
00:11:28,87 --> 00:11:31,57
When the new zoning comes in at
least that will mean that much.

177
00:11:33,12 --> 00:11:35,83
So this this rapidly led to confrontation.

178
00:11:35,88 --> 00:11:40,15
When the council became which was by this
time a little more city council became

179
00:11:40,15 --> 00:11:45,60
aware of how extensive the illegal building
was was it was happening in the hills

180
00:11:45,60 --> 00:11:50,69
they wanted to put the brakes on
and get pull out the bulldozers.

181
00:11:52,19 --> 00:11:56,50
Well at this time. Things
began to move very quickly.

182
00:11:57,35 --> 00:11:59,73
It was felt like a golden period this.

183
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,20
In to be like nothing we could do that
wasn't magical we had balls we had so close.

184
00:12:05,23 --> 00:12:10,88
We had concerts slim dusty came to town.
Walking the main street of dreams and.

185
00:12:11,68 --> 00:12:15,20
I think you know your
slim dusty. Yeah here.

186
00:12:15,38 --> 00:12:20,65
The media you know we're playing at casino.
You know in the air same time with me.

187
00:12:20,71 --> 00:12:25,13
Dropper. We we had a letter
just before the festival.

188
00:12:26,04 --> 00:12:29,86
We were invited to play at the festival
there was a lovely letter from maybe you

189
00:12:29,86 --> 00:12:35,71
know vital part of my partner. Sure.

190
00:12:35,79 --> 00:12:39,76
Noah sure do want to come to dinner come
and meet violet who would like that

191
00:12:39,76 --> 00:12:41,78
and you know slim seen

192
00:12:41,78 --> 00:12:45,35
that enjoyment just lovely people travelling
country towns of our lives just love

193
00:12:45,35 --> 00:12:48,99
this so they came up with their
band and had dinner with us

194
00:12:48,99 --> 00:12:51,72
and we say we want to you know
you've got a night off tomorrow

195
00:12:51,72 --> 00:12:54,20
and i wanted to come to a
concert in the name and hope

196
00:12:54,20 --> 00:12:58,03
that played in the name on whole one time
around with the folk like this guest of

197
00:12:58,03 --> 00:13:03,34
the folk club. So it's a 24 hours to
organize this concert featuring slim dusty

198
00:13:03,34 --> 00:13:05,24
and the best of the first love

199
00:13:05,24 --> 00:13:09,88
and it was a most amazing concert like
the fact everyone's in fact like we will

200
00:13:09,88 --> 00:13:12,04
form. We're just shining that night

201
00:13:12,04 --> 00:13:16,67
and all the townspeople turned out
to see their star slim dusty and.

202
00:13:16,69 --> 00:13:21,05
Slim dusty performed it
was just get a magic.

203
00:13:21,07 --> 00:13:24,91
Those nights and we had naming ceremonies

204
00:13:25,75 --> 00:13:28,20
and healing first to
all this kind of stuff

205
00:13:28,20 --> 00:13:32,34
and for me the the principle of community
organization which i was doing

206
00:13:32,34 --> 00:13:36,56
and sharing with lots of other people
was creating events where people could

207
00:13:36,56 --> 00:13:38,79
experience the joy of community

208
00:13:40,45 --> 00:13:44,54
that what they believed in was affirmed
in the experience of joy together

209
00:13:44,54 --> 00:13:49,61
scheduling. So a night at the folk
club. I remember crying at the songs.

210
00:13:49,68 --> 00:13:51,25
There were some.

211
00:13:51,27 --> 00:13:56,13
It was both the quality of the music in
the voice but also in the sentiments

212
00:13:56,13 --> 00:13:57,43
that people were seeing to each other.

213
00:14:00,84 --> 00:14:07,24
We grew very quickly very tight
as a community and established.

214
00:14:08,61 --> 00:14:13,39
Like i say the norms for the
community the expectation is

215
00:14:13,39 --> 00:14:15,25
that the extraordinary
things happened in yemen

216
00:14:16,26 --> 00:14:19,12
and there are lots of debates about
between vegetarians and movies

217
00:14:19,12 --> 00:14:22,23
and all these kind of stuff
but as if the dreams

218
00:14:22,23 --> 00:14:26,76
that have been seeded by the aquarius
festival began to take form.

219
00:14:27,40 --> 00:14:28,60
In community

220
00:14:29,63 --> 00:14:34,05
and there were sufficient concentration
of people to carry these values into

221
00:14:34,05 --> 00:14:35,68
everyday life and make them realities.

222
00:14:36,76 --> 00:14:39,39
So that for example referring back
to the birth of their own group.

223
00:14:39,43 --> 00:14:43,54
It would only matter of time before
people started having babies families

224
00:14:43,54 --> 00:14:44,38
developing there

225
00:14:45,20 --> 00:14:51,92
and the healings centre was called upon
to help with the birth things. And carol.

226
00:14:52,68 --> 00:14:58,44
Carol's more psychics and you know a
medical medically trained people person.

227
00:14:58,47 --> 00:15:03,22
But see entered into this in the healing
training for acupuncture in good faith.

228
00:15:03,76 --> 00:15:06,36
And goodwill and with lots
of support from people.

229
00:15:07,76 --> 00:15:09,35
Built up this person beyond movement

230
00:15:09,35 --> 00:15:12,87
and birth became a
spiritual experience such

231
00:15:12,88 --> 00:15:18,30
that people preferred to have home births
than go to the lismore base hospital in

232
00:15:18,30 --> 00:15:23,99
the labour ward. Now there outcries of
course from the doctors and calls of fear

233
00:15:23,99 --> 00:15:26,91
and all this kind of stuff
but the end result was

234
00:15:26,91 --> 00:15:29,59
that the labour ward in
lismore changed right.

235
00:15:29,74 --> 00:15:36,10
They made their birthing process is much
more humane much more people centred in a

236
00:15:36,10 --> 00:15:38,01
baby centered.

237
00:15:38,79 --> 00:15:39,83
Than had previously been

238
00:15:40,94 --> 00:15:44,79
and the principles of spiritual midwifery
which been introduced through the new

239
00:15:44,79 --> 00:15:49,32
settlers in then became integrated
in hospital practice in lismore.

240
00:15:49,34 --> 00:15:52,92
So it's like there needs to be a concentration
of people who are willing to have a

241
00:15:52,92 --> 00:15:55,70
home that's wanted this service
and once it was established

242
00:15:55,70 --> 00:16:01,48
and influenced lots of other people as
well. And in. Attitudes towards treece.

243
00:16:03,43 --> 00:16:05,59
The area were settled
by white people first.

244
00:16:06,56 --> 00:16:12,19
North first was people came to this area
to cut down trees the sea to get us into

245
00:16:12,20 --> 00:16:17,20
the primeval forest and first took the cedar
and then it was divided for selection.

246
00:16:18,66 --> 00:16:20,00
The blocks the land was sold down south

247
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:23,15
and one the conditions was the people
come up here and clear their land.

248
00:16:25,16 --> 00:16:29,42
To create farms. So very
quickly an extensive.

249
00:16:30,41 --> 00:16:31,17
Rainforest

250
00:16:31,18 --> 00:16:37,47
that went from the coast to 40 kilometres
inland its normal size including the

251
00:16:37,47 --> 00:16:42,59
tweed valley right down to the
richmond was almost wiped out

252
00:16:43,81 --> 00:16:47,90
and set up for dairy farms.

253
00:16:48,79 --> 00:16:51,64
The new settlers coming to the area had a
completely different attitude to trees

254
00:16:51,64 --> 00:16:54,62
they've been influenced by the
ecology movement things like that.

255
00:16:54,69 --> 00:16:55,11
So even

256
00:16:55,11 --> 00:16:58,01
when we're preparing for the first we
were proposed by people from the borders

257
00:16:58,01 --> 00:17:02,36
ranges saying are you aware what's
happening at the ranges the border ranges.

258
00:17:02,38 --> 00:17:03,99
While the remnants of the big scrub.

259
00:17:04,16 --> 00:17:09,52
And 974 people are aware of the logging
practices were happening on the night cap

260
00:17:09,52 --> 00:17:14,44
range just behind nimbin where the loggers
were just leaving it so the curtain of

261
00:17:14,44 --> 00:17:18,47
trees by the road and almost
clear felling the property.

262
00:17:18,73 --> 00:17:24,52
But the hillsides under supervision of
the forestry commission which was at the

263
00:17:24,52 --> 00:17:29,15
time calling it selective logging which was
take anything of value dropped the lot

264
00:17:31,23 --> 00:17:34,09
when we were first approached about this
with a sense of frustration what can we do

265
00:17:34,09 --> 00:17:35,78
we're organising a festival

266
00:17:35,78 --> 00:17:40,61
and we don't have the wherewithal to
organize a protest at the same time.

267
00:17:42,19 --> 00:17:48,02
But by 1976 like there was a community
concern about what was happening with the

268
00:17:48,02 --> 00:17:50,71
logging and.

269
00:17:50,73 --> 00:17:54,61
And it erupted at the battle of
training creek and the situation was

270
00:17:54,61 --> 00:17:59,66
that the new settlers had
moved into the area.

271
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,45
When the creaks when the
cricket runs into the china.

272
00:18:02,88 --> 00:18:05,81
And it's like two valleys
across from going.

273
00:18:06,33 --> 00:18:10,83
East and going west start going east
from nimbin it's like two valleys across

274
00:18:12,32 --> 00:18:13,91
and it only went one road up the creek

275
00:18:13,91 --> 00:18:20,39
and at the end of the creek was a 50
hectare forest which was enclosed by rock

276
00:18:20,39 --> 00:18:24,68
walls on the other side so
that part of the reason

277
00:18:24,68 --> 00:18:26,97
that it had such old trees in it was that.

278
00:18:27,57 --> 00:18:32,54
Previous technology was in inaccessible
and the brush box wasn't valued for

279
00:18:32,54 --> 00:18:34,56
that much but now the first
commissioner decided

280
00:18:34,56 --> 00:18:37,50
that boris had to go to look
at a log for its brush box

281
00:18:38,56 --> 00:18:41,35
and the residents complained
about the destruction the forest

282
00:18:41,35 --> 00:18:44,59
and they also pointed out that they didn't
want these logging trucks on the road.

283
00:18:44,63 --> 00:18:45,26
There's only one road

284
00:18:47,03 --> 00:18:49,34
and they were in it in negotiations
of the forest commission

285
00:18:49,34 --> 00:18:53,89
and they came to the silt the first commission
said. The first of their following.

286
00:18:54,13 --> 00:18:56,27
We hear concerns but we don't care

287
00:18:56,27 --> 00:19:01,35
and replied the lismore city council was
to put up signs aimed at the residents.

288
00:19:01,37 --> 00:19:07,21
Beware of logging trucks not no signs aimed
at the low interrupts they take care.

289
00:19:07,28 --> 00:19:10,18
But they care for you've chosen
to live here and you'll suffer.

290
00:19:10,79 --> 00:19:13,24
You don't take notice
of a log or interrupt.

291
00:19:13,40 --> 00:19:16,88
So it was like a slap in the face and
all the negotiations came to nothing.

292
00:19:18,35 --> 00:19:22,98
So the people who were negotiating
that decided protest was called for

293
00:19:22,98 --> 00:19:27,02
and they approached me and
other people for assistance.

294
00:19:27,31 --> 00:19:33,78
Transforming a committee
meeting into a public protest.

295
00:19:33,80 --> 00:19:37,26
Now i i joined the protest
at that stage and i.

296
00:19:37,63 --> 00:19:41,11
I didn't ever want to become involved in
any more committees i have been committed

297
00:19:41,11 --> 00:19:42,36
up to my years along.

298
00:19:42,53 --> 00:19:43,33
I was moving

299
00:19:44,09 --> 00:19:48,49
and i i went along for the role i want to
play with like shaman i wanted to just

300
00:19:48,49 --> 00:19:50,61
work on the energy.

301
00:19:50,63 --> 00:19:53,99
That help would hold a group of people
together who certainly first of all draw a

302
00:19:53,99 --> 00:19:59,90
crowd and we created a bit of
theatre which was performed at the.

303
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,65
The china market using big images and
music to tell the story of the protest

304
00:20:05,39 --> 00:20:08,66
and to announce the people there would
be a meeting at the first following

305
00:20:08,66 --> 00:20:11,92
wednesday and.

306
00:20:11,94 --> 00:20:15,74
The bit of theatre was very
graphic begin each is.

307
00:20:15,76 --> 00:20:20,63
Dancing around and kind of mystical.

308
00:20:20,65 --> 00:20:21,98
Big crowds

309
00:20:21,98 --> 00:20:28,70
and so a dollar man was kind of stuff
so sign ominous signs moving in

310
00:20:29,85 --> 00:20:33,37
and the following wednesday
we had a meeting at the site

311
00:20:33,37 --> 00:20:37,03
and the leaders of the festival.

312
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:45,24
How do you turn this into a unified group
of people are going to work together and.

313
00:20:45,25 --> 00:20:49,16
Kids the impulse of committee people
is to stand up from the crowd

314
00:20:49,16 --> 00:20:50,21
and talk at them you know.

315
00:20:50,75 --> 00:20:53,62
And i'm saying well there's
other ways to do it

316
00:20:53,62 --> 00:20:57,21
and one of the things they do is to
complete the circle get people to see in a

317
00:20:57,21 --> 00:20:59,17
circle because if we can
get a circle happening.

318
00:20:59,28 --> 00:21:01,75
We've got the ground where
real communication can happen.

319
00:21:03,22 --> 00:21:08,62
And so with a bit of music and assistance
from friends we completed the circle

320
00:21:09,47 --> 00:21:13,34
and it went from being a disparate people
not knowing whether they should be there

321
00:21:13,34 --> 00:21:17,11
or whether they were present to a group
of people sitting down planning a protest

322
00:21:18,17 --> 00:21:20,25
and trusting each other has
everything the basic trust.

323
00:21:21,71 --> 00:21:28,10
So it was that circles tribal circles
became sort of a fundamental ingredient to.

324
00:21:28,12 --> 00:21:33,35
The forest protests that
happened on wednesday

325
00:21:34,54 --> 00:21:35,65
and the following monday.

326
00:21:35,88 --> 00:21:41,11
It was a council meeting in lismore where
the body farmers very farmers one of the

327
00:21:41,11 --> 00:21:42,89
early communities that had announced

328
00:21:42,89 --> 00:21:47,37
that it was going to build regardless
you know which it was doing the morally

329
00:21:47,37 --> 00:21:47,98
correct thing.

330
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:52,95
It was providing low cost accommodation
to house people so they can raise their

331
00:21:52,95 --> 00:21:55,97
family and no law in the land
should prevent people from doing

332
00:21:55,97 --> 00:21:59,49
that so they took it
totally moral stand and.

333
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:02,82
Let the council know what they were doing
they were working with the home builders

334
00:22:02,82 --> 00:22:02,94
association

335
00:22:02,94 --> 00:22:08,46
and they were determined to be the pivot
you know the case test case they'd

336
00:22:08,46 --> 00:22:09,87
incorporated themselves as a church

337
00:22:09,87 --> 00:22:15,60
and ready to fight as an ethical community
doing what was right in the times

338
00:22:16,69 --> 00:22:20,55
and the council considered
their case that night

339
00:22:20,55 --> 00:22:25,12
and these national party councils got up
and said things like breaking the law.

340
00:22:26,60 --> 00:22:29,59
I advocate that we knock down
the houses as soon as possible

341
00:22:30,46 --> 00:22:34,02
and in the gallery of the body farmers
with their babies line out you know it was

342
00:22:34,02 --> 00:22:40,10
like a classic you know in this like peasant
class this is the new poor you know

343
00:22:40,10 --> 00:22:42,78
totally ethical and clearly clear
about what they want to do.

344
00:22:44,92 --> 00:22:49,76
Against this where these rantings of these
ageing community leaders who had no

345
00:22:49,76 --> 00:22:52,40
regard no compassion
whatsoever for the people.

346
00:22:53,53 --> 00:22:57,59
So for me it was obvious that
the battle for the forest

347
00:22:57,59 --> 00:23:01,97
and the battle for the houses were one
of the same if we lost the trees we'd

348
00:23:01,97 --> 00:23:05,36
certainly lose the houses because i just
bulldoze houses in the same way they

349
00:23:05,36 --> 00:23:09,80
bulldoze the trees. So the name
in news. Put that message out.

350
00:23:10,10 --> 00:23:16,40
You know to everyone. This was it. This
was crunch time and on the wednesday.

351
00:23:16,42 --> 00:23:16,81
After

352
00:23:16,81 --> 00:23:20,98
that meeting the bulldozers arrived at
the forest they came down by back road.

353
00:23:21,52 --> 00:23:25,61
The telephone tree worked and
we you know within an hour.

354
00:23:25,75 --> 00:23:30,70
We had about 100 people gathered
at the forest and the images

355
00:23:30,70 --> 00:23:36,87
that would have been used in the play were
brought to bear and took great pride in.

356
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:41,74
Putting the dollar man image on top of
the bulldozer and it became the icon

357
00:23:41,74 --> 00:23:45,88
that sydney morning herald used to and
that sort of daily report of this protest

358
00:23:46,87 --> 00:23:50,69
and we stopped the bulldoze it was only
a matter of time you know more police

359
00:23:50,69 --> 00:23:52,15
and more reinforcements were coming

360
00:23:52,94 --> 00:23:57,51
and it was a big showdown
the minister for forests.

361
00:23:57,53 --> 00:23:59,93
Was totally against the
hippies he was for.

362
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,20
Griffiths any roadies local newspaper
there is going to do a scene.

363
00:24:04,24 --> 00:24:06,56
We printed that article you know more

364
00:24:06,56 --> 00:24:09,18
or less saying they just
rabble rousing hippies

365
00:24:09,18 --> 00:24:13,48
and we're not entirely noticed other we
printed that report in the name a news.

366
00:24:14,21 --> 00:24:17,44
What would happen instead further.

367
00:24:17,46 --> 00:24:22,14
Raise the ire of the people
and created this community.

368
00:24:22,95 --> 00:24:25,31
Now we brought all our
cultural resources to bear on

369
00:24:25,31 --> 00:24:28,93
that protest the musicians
from the folk love came

370
00:24:28,93 --> 00:24:32,41
and wrote anthems first to sing.

371
00:24:33,00 --> 00:24:38,53
The healers were there to help people all
the communication skills we developed in

372
00:24:38,53 --> 00:24:41,28
the home builders association
replied the coming to agreement

373
00:24:42,51 --> 00:24:45,44
and the community was strong
and i remember the day

374
00:24:45,44 --> 00:24:47,73
that the police reinforcements arrived

375
00:24:47,73 --> 00:24:53,66
and they had people from as far as
newcastle rusted on duty to do the show

376
00:24:53,66 --> 00:24:56,96
and they came along they were psyched up
the police were aggressive they really got

377
00:24:56,96 --> 00:25:02,82
to roll us you know and we were we had
a circle at the camp that morning

378
00:25:02,82 --> 00:25:04,21
and.

379
00:25:05,60 --> 00:25:07,21
We had been lots of discussions

380
00:25:07,21 --> 00:25:10,68
that basically we had been unable
to agree what we were going to do.

381
00:25:12,09 --> 00:25:16,81
There was lots of tension lots of fear
in the circle and no clear direction

382
00:25:18,19 --> 00:25:23,16
and we stood together holding in a circle
holding class arms into intertwined

383
00:25:23,16 --> 00:25:25,92
and i'm took off.

384
00:25:26,69 --> 00:25:32,19
And it's always so supply i'm so strong
you feel the spirit lifting us up.

385
00:25:34,60 --> 00:25:37,04
That i know mine. My knees buckled.

386
00:25:37,21 --> 00:25:41,71
I just couldn't stand tears
streaming down my stream.

387
00:25:42,54 --> 00:25:44,89
But one thing was obvious
that we were in the spirit

388
00:25:46,39 --> 00:25:49,52
that some strong in the
spirit we would be together

389
00:25:49,52 --> 00:25:54,75
and we would defend the forest and
we would win it was clear and.

390
00:25:54,77 --> 00:26:00,14
So we yielded before the police. Back.

391
00:26:02,14 --> 00:26:04,28
They they just barged through
they pushed through our lines.

392
00:26:05,10 --> 00:26:06,94
They pushed away the obstacles
and the bulldozers.

393
00:26:07,47 --> 00:26:12,92
Plowed with the forest bearing a road to
take the logs out. But we stayed there.

394
00:26:14,71 --> 00:26:15,68
And then it became obvious

395
00:26:15,68 --> 00:26:19,62
that our perseverance was going to win
the battle the longer we stay there was

396
00:26:19,62 --> 00:26:22,16
costing the police. Heaps.

397
00:26:22,17 --> 00:26:25,90
In the state government they were paying
the police overtime there putting them up

398
00:26:25,90 --> 00:26:30,03
and motels was going to stuff whereas we
were living in a home country this was the

399
00:26:30,03 --> 00:26:31,36
battle of them being through right.

400
00:26:31,50 --> 00:26:35,54
They were the invading
force we owned the hills

401
00:26:36,34 --> 00:26:38,78
and so people would bring us
supplies there bring us food.

402
00:26:39,47 --> 00:26:45,30
We had a camp kitchen co-operative cooking
stuff was the aquarius festival over

403
00:26:45,30 --> 00:26:48,74
again. Right. We were singing and enjoying
ourselves and dancing and talking

404
00:26:48,74 --> 00:26:52,45
and sitting around campfires
we were very good at this.

405
00:26:52,82 --> 00:26:57,08
So for four weeks we maintain
this presence in the forest

406
00:26:57,08 --> 00:27:02,14
and pressure on the logging operations
and as time went by we became stronger

407
00:27:02,14 --> 00:27:05,57
and stronger as time went
by the police became weaker

408
00:27:05,57 --> 00:27:10,24
and weaker as a defence force for the
loggers because every day they talk to

409
00:27:10,24 --> 00:27:12,65
hippies most battles are
sitting around doing nothing.

410
00:27:12,91 --> 00:27:15,88
So the police are sitting in the forest
saying this is a really nice forest isn't

411
00:27:15,88 --> 00:27:20,53
it. And they be so well massaged and.

412
00:27:20,54 --> 00:27:24,69
And so in the end it was like the police
wouldn't allow the logging trucks to go

413
00:27:24,69 --> 00:27:26,49
out without.

414
00:27:26,51 --> 00:27:30,61
Armed guards right without
a convoy of police cars

415
00:27:30,61 --> 00:27:33,38
and policemen which took a
long time to organise so

416
00:27:33,38 --> 00:27:38,85
that the logging operation was
incredibly slow down as well and.

417
00:27:40,34 --> 00:27:41,79
So it was that.

418
00:27:41,81 --> 00:27:48,17
A moratorium was called neville wran
changed his position and talking about.

419
00:27:48,19 --> 00:27:49,04
What he calls it.

420
00:27:49,68 --> 00:27:55,23
You know he rap ag's removed from can
describe me as i said he rapped concern

421
00:27:55,23 --> 00:27:59,18
conservationists within two weeks right
is suddenly realize there were votes.

422
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,16
In conservation and called
a halt to the operation

423
00:28:05,16 --> 00:28:07,95
and an inquiry which.

424
00:28:09,05 --> 00:28:10,78
We knew in the forests we knew we'd won

425
00:28:10,78 --> 00:28:13,57
and it took two years for the
state government to acknowledge

426
00:28:13,57 --> 00:28:16,69
that they weren't going to log a forest
there again it was going to become a state

427
00:28:16,69 --> 00:28:18,39
park. So we won.

428
00:28:18,74 --> 00:28:21,80
And because of the heat that
was generated by that battle

429
00:28:22,72 --> 00:28:23,89
when it came to the housing issue.

430
00:28:24,12 --> 00:28:28,31
The state government stepped in when we
are able to say look we won the forest

431
00:28:28,31 --> 00:28:32,58
and now they're going to get us and
like that the houses pull landers at

432
00:28:32,58 --> 00:28:34,29
that time the minister the late paul land

433
00:28:34,29 --> 00:28:36,95
that was minister for planning stepped in

434
00:28:36,95 --> 00:28:41,48
and employed coal james the planner of
the equus festival to come up with a

435
00:28:41,48 --> 00:28:48,01
solution to the zoning problem which led
to multiple occupancy dwellings up here.

436
00:28:48,82 --> 00:28:54,16
So it was as if we went from a very
short time post the queries festival

437
00:28:54,16 --> 00:28:58,60
when the community was weak
in disparate with a vision

438
00:28:59,43 --> 00:29:02,59
and committed work from a number of
people to create a sense of community

439
00:29:02,59 --> 00:29:05,14
and shared values into a community

440
00:29:05,14 --> 00:29:07,61
that was strong enough to
take on the first commission

441
00:29:09,64 --> 00:29:13,05
and completely reverse attitudes
to logging in the area.

442
00:29:13,98 --> 00:29:17,78
The battle of trainee creek was the
first successful rainforest defence in

443
00:29:17,78 --> 00:29:22,17
australia. The people who fought
that fight went down to the franklin

444
00:29:22,17 --> 00:29:24,43
and taught people not non-violent action.

445
00:29:24,75 --> 00:29:26,47
So they were a major influence in the way

446
00:29:26,47 --> 00:29:33,20
that the franklin was fought the the people
also the nightcap range which is the

447
00:29:33,20 --> 00:29:36,01
one overlooking member a
couple of years later

448
00:29:36,74 --> 00:29:41,46
that anniversary last this year
was defended and the night

449
00:29:41,46 --> 00:29:45,57
that range which was the last major
pocket of rainforest of the big scrub was

450
00:29:46,78 --> 00:29:47,97
turned into a national park.

451
00:29:49,75 --> 00:29:54,55
So within a short time from i
would say from 74 through to 78.

452
00:29:55,99 --> 00:29:59,93
A sense of community had been created that
was strong enough to defend the values.

453
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:01,32
So they're community and make them real

454
00:30:02,55 --> 00:30:06,76
and it had went from strength to
strength and you know i i think it.

455
00:30:06,77 --> 00:30:09,32
You know get a number of
influences on the north coast

456
00:30:10,06 --> 00:30:13,21
and trace them to aquarian values values

457
00:30:13,21 --> 00:30:17,14
that we had some expression in the name

458
00:30:17,14 --> 00:30:22,71
and festival of 73 taking taking
shape as community practice

459
00:30:22,71 --> 00:30:27,95
and then influencing the wider community.

460
00:30:28,67 --> 00:30:28,87
One

461
00:30:28,88 --> 00:30:33,97
that influences interest me in particular is
attitude towards social change nonviolent

462
00:30:33,97 --> 00:30:34,45
social action

463
00:30:36,66 --> 00:30:39,59
and what i was talking about before about
learning to have meetings together

464
00:30:39,59 --> 00:30:42,58
learning to have affective meetings.

465
00:30:42,60 --> 00:30:49,27
Has now become taken the first
to developed into despair

466
00:30:49,27 --> 00:30:55,39
and empowerment workshops. People
learning skills to develop.

467
00:30:56,55 --> 00:31:00,21
Ways of handling resisting
the nuclear holocaust.

468
00:31:00,69 --> 00:31:06,35
You know melting down the plowshares
how to do this on a world scale.

469
00:31:07,36 --> 00:31:10,89
Into this area came to the
idea of expressing despair

470
00:31:10,89 --> 00:31:15,12
when one of the ways to express
despair and out of the spare doing

471
00:31:15,12 --> 00:31:17,10
that collectively would come agreements

472
00:31:17,10 --> 00:31:20,07
and people being able to work together to
make a difference in their lives in their

473
00:31:20,07 --> 00:31:26,85
communities when that those ideas
combined with rainforest action ideas.

474
00:31:26,86 --> 00:31:30,86
We've got become sort of all
beings which john seed.

475
00:31:30,88 --> 00:31:35,66
And joanna macy wrote a book called thinking
like a mountain which is a kind of a

476
00:31:35,66 --> 00:31:42,37
ritual where people can express.
