1
00:00:19,21 --> 00:00:25,03
Identification. This is Section six recorded with faith.

2
00:00:25,16 --> 00:00:31,36
Bandler and Karen Craig on Friday the twenty seventh of June one thousand nine hundred seventy.

3
00:00:31,78 --> 00:00:40,78
And the tape became a scene a few seconds time. When defied in difficult.

4
00:00:40,8 --> 00:00:45,96
Face do you want to just go on from where you left off last week.

5
00:00:47,32 --> 00:01:04,83
I was talking last week about my life at King's Cross and how I made it is must play and I'll continue from there.

6
00:01:06,85 --> 00:01:19,68
Well. It is true he had an immense. Influence on my life. In a very quiet way.

7
00:01:19,7 --> 00:01:30,24
He was already thought of himself as a Marxist and believed that they issued more equal

8
00:01:30,24 --> 00:01:39,29
or distribution of the wealth of a country for all people. And they were ideas that rather appealed to me.

9
00:01:40,47 --> 00:01:46,92
And I think that had basis for the development of my relationship with him.

10
00:01:48,34 --> 00:02:00,26
And it for me was an extremely rewarding relationship. Mainly because it was all new to me.

11
00:02:00,44 --> 00:02:10,38
I've always wondered why there was this terrible imbalance. With the people of a country where you had.

12
00:02:11,21 --> 00:02:21,47
So much wealth and so much poverty. And not awfully much in between. And. So he.

13
00:02:21,48 --> 00:02:36,01
He talked about this and I found this very and reaching. I did think.

14
00:02:37,31 --> 00:02:45,09
I did know that I fully appreciate fully appreciated what he could give at that it was only after that

15
00:02:45,89 --> 00:02:58,96
but life was good for me I had my by then had moved from doweling street into street and up ahead and attic room there.

16
00:02:59,21 --> 00:03:03,2
But at least it had a little kitchen outside of the main bedroom.

17
00:03:03,76 --> 00:03:12,97
And it was a great atmosphere this was in the heart of. And. People knew each other and people helped each other.

18
00:03:13,31 --> 00:03:19,4
And my landlord was a man who who was Finnish.

19
00:03:19,99 --> 00:03:31,44
And he was a slum landlord he masters and twenty or thirty slum houses in woman who and about my.

20
00:03:31,46 --> 00:03:38,09
I'm not sure that my have been some in Paddington but I'm not quite sure about that but he owned a lot

21
00:03:38,94 --> 00:03:41,78
and he was really a slum lion note.

22
00:03:42,69 --> 00:03:47,22
But I had good politics and his wife

23
00:03:48,68 --> 00:03:57,61
and I became very friendly they lived in a little street called how much street just leading off for street

24
00:03:58,58 --> 00:04:08,87
and it was such a slum I can't describe what it looked in themselves. His main interest was in Masonry.

25
00:04:08,89 --> 00:04:14,8
So cross the road in one of his many many houses he got her sort of finish so want to get in

26
00:04:14,8 --> 00:04:20,37
and tenants were free to go. Which I used.

27
00:04:20,39 --> 00:04:31,02
And it was fun to hear we were all poor and we all had each other great community spirit. And we used to.

28
00:04:34,05 --> 00:04:44,69
And then we'd all my coffee and. Sit in the street. Out in the street you know you didn't go inside.

29
00:04:45,84 --> 00:04:50,62
On the Greek people board and Sunday night. The Greeks would mean they had fish in it.

30
00:04:52,25 --> 00:05:11,59
And we'd all sit outside while I sang and played. You. Like a good. Yes. Well the instrument similar to the good.

31
00:05:12,18 --> 00:05:18,56
And I'd sing in Greek and as they may indeed they named it all hang or drinking coffee.

32
00:05:20,57 --> 00:05:28,05
Nobody drank wine because wine was priceless. It wasn't that long after the war if you got a bottle of wine.

33
00:05:28,35 --> 00:05:31,11
You know you'd feel like a queen of the earth.

34
00:05:32,75 --> 00:05:37,86
There was a lovely atmosphere there and the landlord and his family would your needed.

35
00:05:39,3 --> 00:05:44,71
They were the most of them were his tenants and I had little the little corner shops

36
00:05:45,89 --> 00:05:58,45
and that was where most of the gossip went on. But there was a feeling of safety physical safety. And not so much.

37
00:05:58,72 --> 00:06:06,08
I'm sure that some of them in or around there would have raped a woman with a flick of an eyebrow.

38
00:06:06,67 --> 00:06:15,95
And I but the women somehow protected each other. We looked after each other. And.

39
00:06:18,75 --> 00:06:25,21
And so I would come down and join in with what was good at whatever was going on.

40
00:06:25,23 --> 00:06:34,39
It was a bit new to him in a way although he'd been Australia for many many many years. He he. He was born in Finland.

41
00:06:34,63 --> 00:06:42,55
But he was brought up in Sweden. And my family too. Very wealthy are.

42
00:06:42,57 --> 00:06:46,92
And he came from really an upper middle class background

43
00:06:48,69 --> 00:06:55,6
and he never talked about it all three match until he touched on.

44
00:06:55,98 --> 00:07:01,4
When I asked him about his childhood and so forth and he laughed

45
00:07:01,4 --> 00:07:08,35
and he said he still had two sisters who were living at that over in Sweden.

46
00:07:08,74 --> 00:07:18,26
And so I said you know if you've got to write to them. He said. I ran away and I didn't go to university here.

47
00:07:18,77 --> 00:07:28,1
I jump to shape and I became a seaman and what you have to ship in Australia and here.

48
00:07:28,87 --> 00:07:34,34
He says you know I'm a bit of a black sheep of the family but I said Oh you must write to your sister.

49
00:07:34,55 --> 00:07:41,59
So he wrote to his two sisters. And then after some months thereafter a parcel.

50
00:07:42,85 --> 00:07:54,28
And it was a pass over to all of him so forth. His parents. His family.

51
00:07:55,22 --> 00:08:04,28
They lived in great comfort tremendous force so. And it was wonderful saying these photographs you know.

52
00:08:05,65 --> 00:08:13,83
It was like a fairy tale did people really sit out on the gauge the like can be waited on by servants for afternoon tea

53
00:08:16,15 --> 00:08:23,65
tables and. So from here was this man living here and. He would come down.

54
00:08:24,9 --> 00:08:32,53
Also on Sunday night with me and it was wonderful because he would also ensure. Hearing.

55
00:08:34,15 --> 00:08:40,26
The Greeks music singing and The Who had the ten hands and then Lou.

56
00:08:41,88 --> 00:08:44,81
Had a right spirit

57
00:08:46,41 --> 00:08:55,01
and nobody would agree even if they if they voted for the Liberal Party they wouldn't be good enough to say.

58
00:08:56,04 --> 00:09:03,69
Everyone that may have acted like they didn't vote Labor they voted for come as party.

59
00:09:03,7 --> 00:09:12,92
And then I was asked if I would go to Billy with Margaret in the Margaret walk a dance group.

60
00:09:13,25 --> 00:09:27,6
And I was very hesitant at first and cows you know you can. And the FE was four hundred fifty pounds three to buy it.

61
00:09:28,94 --> 00:09:38,42
And I didn't have four hundred fifty pounds. So. I had a very dear friend whose name was Margaret you.

62
00:09:38,44 --> 00:09:46,55
Lived very wealthy we did. But she was very progressive very left wing.

63
00:09:47,43 --> 00:09:55,06
She had a husband who was involved in the big steel works very well.

64
00:09:57,34 --> 00:10:03,12
And she was very kind and generous and should take me out to lunch

65
00:10:03,83 --> 00:10:12,68
and we'd go to lunch in the Chelsea which was the place to lunch in Sydney. It was down in the quay. And.

66
00:10:12,7 --> 00:10:16,82
She had taken herself off to Czechoslovakia and she.

67
00:10:17,00 --> 00:10:24,16
Fell in love with the place and was absolutely convinced that they had a world where.

68
00:10:24,18 --> 00:10:33,59
And she believed that she was very generous to the communists in Australia with her money. Anyhow.

69
00:10:35,59 --> 00:10:41,23
She took me to lunch one day here and she said I hear you've been asked to go to.

70
00:10:42,42 --> 00:10:47,65
Billion with the market for credit and screw and child you must go which he said

71
00:10:48,4 --> 00:10:59,98
and I said Harker for it she said yes you can. And she said Come I'm certain. And we'll talk a little more about it.

72
00:11:00,12 --> 00:11:08,9
So I went back and Len Fox came with me and we went to Margaret who lived in the are every new in her room.

73
00:11:09,49 --> 00:11:18,31
Where I guess that's where my dressmaker lives now Mark mentions opposite. After all it is and.

74
00:11:20,77 --> 00:11:27,38
And she said look you simply must go and she got up and she went to a beautiful and take this

75
00:11:28,23 --> 00:11:32,51
and wrote the check for four hundred fifty pounds and said he you are my child

76
00:11:33,52 --> 00:11:42,17
and what you will need is not a lot of crying. But you must you cannot go to Europe with it.

77
00:11:42,26 --> 00:11:51,9
You must have it and she went to her wardrobe. And she brought up this beautiful.

78
00:11:51,92 --> 00:11:56,87
Wish I could think of the name of the brand the very famous Scottish coat

79
00:11:57,88 --> 00:12:08,36
and for many years it was again only thing that wealthy people around Sydney in the winter beautifully tailored.

80
00:12:09,68 --> 00:12:16,14
Cotton and I am of the cloth. But anyhow she said and you could wrap it up a new ball and.

81
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:23,63
Use it for a pillar and it won't have a crease in the morning. Little she knew that I would put it to the test.

82
00:12:23,99 --> 00:12:36,51
So anyhow I went home with a checking account. And you know I was getting that you know you needed more than your fair.

83
00:12:36,52 --> 00:12:43,00
And had a little bank account I didn't have much. And Karl said to me that.

84
00:12:43,47 --> 00:12:51,37
Every fortnight you go to such and such a place and they will pay you know Lance.

85
00:12:52,14 --> 00:12:57,69
And for the whole eleven months I was there he kept it.

86
00:12:58,67 --> 00:13:04,67
And I pounce a fortnight would come and there was a lot of money. A lot of money. I found myself.

87
00:13:05,3 --> 00:13:15,99
Lending to other strains who'd gone broke. So. The day came.

88
00:13:19,2 --> 00:13:29,75
And I packed and I packed very sensibly because I knew is that we would be staying in which was.

89
00:13:29,77 --> 00:13:36,93
A little while and we'd be staying about four days in Bombay. So I made sure I took some nice loose cool copy.

90
00:13:37,27 --> 00:13:44,15
Things about my coat and. Like a couple of slacks.

91
00:13:44,37 --> 00:13:54,58
I only had one suitcase and I made sure I would only carry one suitcase and my new hand they showed their strength

92
00:13:55,3 --> 00:14:12,39
and it was very solidly that. So. The campaign to get Australians to go to this cultural festival. In the ruins of.

93
00:14:12,41 --> 00:14:16,72
Began to spread throughout Australia. And.

94
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:27,00
Ask who initiated it that will be known to me at the time I'm sure that it was east.

95
00:14:27,02 --> 00:14:39,88
The East German capital which was communist together with the Australian Communist Party. But it was in my direction.

96
00:14:39,9 --> 00:14:49,86
Absolutely. We had a Methodist past and we had people from the Anglican Church and to this church.

97
00:14:50,2 --> 00:14:53,32
We had trade unionists who didn't belong to.

98
00:14:54,89 --> 00:15:00,02
I think they probably well I might have been Labor Party people there was a big contingent.

99
00:15:00,72 --> 00:15:03,92
From the Labor Party in fact.

100
00:15:03,94 --> 00:15:14,9
And also Communist Party members but it seemed to me all along that they were controlling things. Well you should care.

101
00:15:16,49 --> 00:15:26,47
This was a thing to happen to me I was going on a brand new Italian food from Sydney to Naples who let the plot he

102
00:15:26,47 --> 00:15:30,74
think. Listen. MAURICE.

103
00:15:30,75 --> 00:15:37,75
And of course it was in the middle of the Cold War and you cross and forget that Menzies at that time.

104
00:15:38,25 --> 00:15:48,6
Had was campaigning for his party was campaigning for the nineteen fifty one referendum to ban the Communist Party.

105
00:15:49,86 --> 00:15:51,96
So you can imagine.

106
00:15:51,97 --> 00:16:02,78
That things were pretty bloody tense in this country and I'll talk later about that terrible period of the Cold War.

107
00:16:02,8 --> 00:16:16,86
That the day actually. Got a taxi called the taxi and I just want to come back to my life with it lasted.

108
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:22,59
For so many years I never we never lived together I always had my own room.

109
00:16:23,01 --> 00:16:36,25
But I would call him to his unit which was considered quite power. I have to work every day. And he would have this.

110
00:16:36,26 --> 00:16:45,86
And we turned. And we would have he would prepare a marvelous dinner.

111
00:16:47,62 --> 00:16:59,96
And where he got the while but there was almost a bottle of red. I never fainted alcohol particularly bad.

112
00:17:00,1 --> 00:17:08,84
Somehow I think you know we'd have dinner by candlelight and there would be perhaps lovely results

113
00:17:08,84 --> 00:17:18,08
and he would grind the meat himself to make sure it didn't have certain what was kind of. And.

114
00:17:18,09 --> 00:17:23,97
I do always battle for myself. No one ever looked after me.

115
00:17:25,85 --> 00:17:35,99
Shore walk over now it's very kind to me but it was a kindness that was on the surface as it were.

116
00:17:36,12 --> 00:17:45,06
But here was a kindness that had a great day. It was just beautiful. And as the years went by.

117
00:17:46,55 --> 00:17:55,89
He would have cut his right hand off to do for me if I said so and I had to.

118
00:17:56,77 --> 00:18:03,21
And one night here that night he sort of had a special and it was this little box

119
00:18:04,53 --> 00:18:16,82
and you know it was a beautiful bracelet started with. I still weird and it's now fifty one years old. I still wear.

120
00:18:17,00 --> 00:18:27,58
The watch that he gave me which is now in its fiftieth year and it goes beautifully. So.

121
00:18:27,6 --> 00:18:40,38
Although many were that he left very deep impressions on my life I did know what would have happened had I never met.

122
00:18:42,62 --> 00:18:51,7
And why you from. Maybe I just would have continued going like that and looking after him when he became an old man.

123
00:18:51,72 --> 00:19:03,17
But he died only three years ago. I feel now. Terribly sad for me but I can say that he had.

124
00:19:03,65 --> 00:19:11,11
I was able to help him in his old age he was older than me fifteen years older than me and I was able to help him

125
00:19:11,11 --> 00:19:20,22
when he became ill when he didn't have a house obviously able to get him a beautiful unit and.

126
00:19:21,33 --> 00:19:31,26
Because he couldn't live in the place he had he couldn't managers and there was a woman whom I knew went a very down

127
00:19:31,26 --> 00:19:33,6
and looked after him and took care of him

128
00:19:33,6 --> 00:19:43,9
and he actually bought her car for her if she could take her for a drive sounds very exceptional person fare hikes.

129
00:19:44,24 --> 00:19:58,67
Very exceptional in every way I well come back to the trip to Bill in. I went off. And I went down to the.

130
00:19:59,25 --> 00:20:02,26
Being fair world with a bad idea and had failed.

131
00:20:02,35 --> 00:20:12,85
The wife of the author William had for help and her sister Margaret Fulton. Did I show you that. Photographs. And Card.

132
00:20:13,99 --> 00:20:23,1
And I was very impressed with this ship. It was posh beautiful that all the delegates had to sleep in dormitories.

133
00:20:23,75 --> 00:20:27,06
There was a very installment three and a women's dormitory

134
00:20:27,91 --> 00:20:38,09
and I was asked to go into the dormitory with all the women of course. And we slept in bags.

135
00:20:39,1 --> 00:20:43,43
Well I had little slept in the dormitory because it was hot

136
00:20:44,3 --> 00:20:55,44
and I would go up on deck with my sleeping bag like so many others do you know and sleep on the dick you know and.

137
00:20:55,45 --> 00:21:08,6
But the food was one of the Easy. Breakfasts fantastic lunches and dinners you know octopus.

138
00:21:08,61 --> 00:21:24,59
Small fishes cooked beautifully. Great pestis. And he were ninety one of us. Well we've called in Fremantle.

139
00:21:25,12 --> 00:21:32,43
And by then I had already made some very famous writers in Australia and among them.

140
00:21:33,42 --> 00:21:38,46
Katherine Susan and Pritchard and she came down on the boat to say goodbye.

141
00:21:38,48 --> 00:21:44,06
Where in her beautiful brown velvet jacket and the cream rose in the lower pale.

142
00:21:45,53 --> 00:22:00,75
And somewhere I have a photograph of it but after. It has failed. Well. Then we set off for Columbus.

143
00:22:02,59 --> 00:22:13,11
Is it called Colombo the capital of us or Lanka. Doesn't matter anyhow. And there we were met by the Buddhists.

144
00:22:13,13 --> 00:22:22,47
They knew we were coming. And I said they knew. We were carrying to a festival for peace between the West and the east.

145
00:22:22,48 --> 00:22:34,83
And they came to told us that that they expected us to go to a meeting for peace in the city town hall.

146
00:22:34,84 --> 00:22:39,47
And so the greatest number of us.

147
00:22:39,49 --> 00:22:47,03
Delegation went I think some of Black's went off to look for other things but we weren't.

148
00:22:49,03 --> 00:23:01,09
Perhaps it was of wonderful right here sitting. In this huge turn. Where the Buddhists. And you.

149
00:23:01,14 --> 00:23:11,55
I just looked at a sea of hit. And golden groups. And these people were for peace.

150
00:23:13,38 --> 00:23:23,53
And I thought back in Australia we can't even hire who. To hold meetings for peace. To the peace movement.

151
00:23:23,96 --> 00:23:27,22
Look at this isn't this wonderful.

152
00:23:27,24 --> 00:23:33,21
And they asked some of us to speak in the name of peace

153
00:23:34,69 --> 00:23:46,19
and we were welcomed very warmly by a man who also in the meeting and he was a member of the single least parliament

154
00:23:46,19 --> 00:23:57,42
and his name was Peter. Kinnaman. Marvelous looking man very handsome and. Very forthright.

155
00:23:57,98 --> 00:24:09,36
And very determined that world peace should continue. You see the war had only just ended.

156
00:24:09,38 --> 00:24:16,63
And so we had wonderful meeting. And I felt very very here because.

157
00:24:17,18 --> 00:24:20,91
Here in Australia there was only one who we could really use

158
00:24:21,85 --> 00:24:27,51
and that was that number eighty one eighty eight your street was.

159
00:24:29,92 --> 00:24:40,81
And here we were going into countries that were shouting peace world peace from the rooftops.

160
00:24:43,54 --> 00:24:50,03
Just delegation of ninety one people did it cover all areas of what.

161
00:24:51,9 --> 00:24:57,95
What what kind of people other than the maggot or could dance group in the delegation.

162
00:24:57,97 --> 00:25:13,84
The delegation consisted of artists singers musicians of several years since it was a cultural festival you see trade

163
00:25:13,85 --> 00:25:24,46
unionists and I joined Margaret's dance group these great big miners and war feasts and.

164
00:25:24,47 --> 00:25:31,18
They were you know a very good player that had to do with the lending of the whites in Australia in the treatment of

165
00:25:31,18 --> 00:25:35,97
the complex and the killing of the Aboriginal people.

166
00:25:37,51 --> 00:25:48,86
And that was part of the reason why I went because I was in that particular play. And there were church people.

167
00:25:49,67 --> 00:25:54,09
And church people for priests who were having a tough time in Australia. You know.

168
00:25:54,58 --> 00:26:03,75
They were being blacklisted by the government and. They were able to meet up with church people in other countries.

169
00:26:03,77 --> 00:26:15,08
And I thought that was very worthwhile. It wasn't using delegation and I'm using. Ninety one of us.

170
00:26:15,1 --> 00:26:21,23
But I missed a bit and I'm not. Remember to say that today from Fremantle.

171
00:26:21,56 --> 00:26:30,97
I had become rather friendly with the woman who had the bank. About me I was on the bottom back and she was on the top.

172
00:26:32,67 --> 00:26:43,84
And we were about to have a me early evening meal. And we thought we'd have a share. So there was a long arm I panic.

173
00:26:44,49 --> 00:26:52,32
And I said I'll get Musharraf. And she said Marcia aren't and she came back into the dormitory.

174
00:26:52,92 --> 00:27:01,97
And we all know why what we did was push their suitcases under the bottom bunk because space was very precious.

175
00:27:01,99 --> 00:27:10,7
And I was a rich fortunate because I had spent many days in my life camping and knowing how to economize with space

176
00:27:11,41 --> 00:27:14,59
and always knowing how. I've been in the land.

177
00:27:14,6 --> 00:27:21,99
I mean you had to consider others and you always made sure you left a share of the plane and small things like that

178
00:27:21,99 --> 00:27:30,26
and you didn't spread yourself so travelling with so many women in the storm. It was no problem at all.

179
00:27:31,6 --> 00:27:49,42
Anyhow and no one had her. And she came back and bed to pull her suitcase from under my bag and their hands.

180
00:27:49,44 --> 00:28:00,04
Begging her not to scream. But she did. We had a stowaway from Fremantle.

181
00:28:00,06 --> 00:28:07,69
Chose Our bank to get around that and there were no more.

182
00:28:08,82 --> 00:28:25,54
Stacked legged squatting to pull a suitcase out of the man's face comes up between her legs. Well you know I went like.

183
00:28:25,56 --> 00:28:34,32
I can't remember where I think it was put off here but. Columbus. I think. If I remember correctly.

184
00:28:35,65 --> 00:28:52,6
Anyhow we then left Colombo we went over to. Useful experience and. So they had for a big meeting.

185
00:28:52,61 --> 00:29:05,04
For Peace and Freedom. Peace and Freedom. Now the end of the first quarter it was wonderful just wonderful.

186
00:29:07,11 --> 00:29:18,96
We spent four days there we lived on the ship and we came and went. I've never seen poverty like that ever ever ever.

187
00:29:19,69 --> 00:29:26,92
And the Indian trade union people. Took us out of town to where they lived.

188
00:29:27,85 --> 00:29:37,46
And in the streets of the people to take the children with perhaps minus and a leg so they'd make.

189
00:29:37,47 --> 00:29:46,19
Be a more effective big but when we went to the trade union. Community. I remember very clearly.

190
00:29:46,63 --> 00:29:52,92
I dropped some money out of my pocket and the child picked it up and gave it.

191
00:29:53,63 --> 00:30:03,1
But the most unbelievable poverty such as I can't describe it.
