1
00:00:17,12 --> 00:00:22,06
So by. The 20th of november.

2
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:28,68
Wearing fluorescent vision.

3
00:00:28,70 --> 00:00:34,74
You know.

4
00:00:34,76 --> 00:00:36,26
I came up to nimbin.

5
00:00:36,77 --> 00:00:42,90
And so on but you know like i wrote.

6
00:00:43,64 --> 00:00:48,92
I'm fluoresce division. When i
lived in sydney i was francesca.

7
00:00:50,09 --> 00:00:51,71
But since moving up here.

8
00:00:52,38 --> 00:00:55,65
I've decided that i like my name
to come back to me as a mantra.

9
00:00:56,81 --> 00:01:02,99
And so i've called myself
virgin forest where.

10
00:01:06,14 --> 00:01:11,78
I came to nimbin india lee
eighties for a three week holiday.

11
00:01:11,79 --> 00:01:17,56
And found myself having my first
environmental arrest near mount nardi

12
00:01:19,00 --> 00:01:23,09
protecting the forest environment
became an issue from

13
00:01:23,09 --> 00:01:32,04
that point on it was about.

14
00:01:34,43 --> 00:01:39,74
I didn't stay i actually had a very close
connection with kings cross for 10 years

15
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:42,53
and i was very fond of king's cross.

16
00:01:42,88 --> 00:01:46,99
So i had a double paul in you
came up here when he was five

17
00:01:46,99 --> 00:01:51,33
and fell in love with the
place. So he kept pulling back.

18
00:01:51,35 --> 00:01:58,06
And so i've kept a very close
connection with people from the

19
00:01:58,06 --> 00:01:59,66
time when there were environmental.

20
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,33
Activated with me

21
00:02:03,36 --> 00:02:07,09
and so over the years of close
kept very close friendship

22
00:02:08,39 --> 00:02:13,78
and it was normal feeling to come

23
00:02:13,78 --> 00:02:16,08
and live up here after a while

24
00:02:17,07 --> 00:02:22,81
when i got here a few years back to.

25
00:02:22,83 --> 00:02:25,80
Help run the rainforest
information centre in lismore

26
00:02:27,09 --> 00:02:29,66
and i was there for
about a year and a bit.

27
00:02:29,67 --> 00:02:36,34
And then i moved to living
in teepees i've decided

28
00:02:36,34 --> 00:02:43,05
that i had to live closer to the
ground closer to where mother

29
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:44,40
nature was suffering and.

30
00:02:45,64 --> 00:02:51,60
And feeling what it is that we need to
do really you know just ask directly.

31
00:02:51,61 --> 00:02:57,58
Your environment what needs to be done
and becomes really really very clear.

32
00:02:57,59 --> 00:02:58,96
Certain things need to be done

33
00:02:58,96 --> 00:03:13,40
and you do actually.

34
00:03:13,42 --> 00:03:18,99
A love for freedom is my motivating force.

35
00:03:21,75 --> 00:03:28,74
I like to live in an environment where
i'm not closed in my best expression

36
00:03:28,74 --> 00:03:28,90
for

37
00:03:28,90 --> 00:03:34,74
that is maybe the aboriginal way their guns
they had a gun you know which had no separation

38
00:03:34,74 --> 00:03:39,70
between inside and outside.
And that is how i feel best.

39
00:03:40,69 --> 00:03:47,41
That's how i feel i am living. To my
utmost. Rather than. Hiding away.

40
00:03:47,59 --> 00:03:48,75
You know in a box.

41
00:03:49,61 --> 00:03:50,45
You know in the house

42
00:03:51,83 --> 00:03:56,54
and it feels like the perfect perfect
thing for me to be doing you know my body

43
00:03:56,54 --> 00:03:59,85
loves the. I love dancing. I can.

44
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,53
It into singing i can do things

45
00:04:03,53 --> 00:04:13,38
that come much more spontaneously if you
living in close connection with nature.

46
00:04:16,81 --> 00:04:20,43
Knowing that the rainforest.

47
00:04:20,45 --> 00:04:25,50
Yes i know that the rainforest.
Is the womb of life.

48
00:04:27,31 --> 00:04:29,37
And there's only a few
remnants left on the planet.

49
00:04:29,83 --> 00:04:34,01
Relation to what it was
not so very long ago.

50
00:04:34,03 --> 00:04:38,49
So it is of the utmost importance
that we protect his remnant.

51
00:04:39,73 --> 00:04:41,16
And live

52
00:04:41,17 --> 00:04:46,68
when we live in close proximity with these
remnants live in total understanding of

53
00:04:46,68 --> 00:04:50,03
our environment and in
total connection with it.

54
00:04:51,27 --> 00:04:52,79
That is my spirit

55
00:04:52,79 --> 00:05:05,80
and.

56
00:05:09,56 --> 00:05:12,38
He actually had the straddle both worlds.

57
00:05:12,45 --> 00:05:15,96
I lived in kings cross for a lot
of that time is only been here.

58
00:05:16,38 --> 00:05:17,83
Proximately the same time as me.

59
00:05:20,13 --> 00:05:26,84
Yeah yeah yeah ok ok sorry
that that has not experiences.

60
00:05:27,48 --> 00:05:30,87
For i had my son emu.

61
00:05:31,15 --> 00:05:36,07
Lived in kings cross for the
first 12 years of his life.

62
00:05:36,09 --> 00:05:42,41
And you only had certain times
away from kings cross up here but

63
00:05:42,42 --> 00:05:44,85
that was enough for him to
become an environmentalist

64
00:05:45,98 --> 00:05:51,07
and he has gone to america on his own
twice to sing from coast to coast

65
00:05:52,40 --> 00:05:59,05
environmental song and so he
keeps coming back to this place.

66
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:00,43
This place.

67
00:06:01,45 --> 00:06:08,41
He loved his child

68
00:06:08,41 --> 00:06:17,93
for education.

69
00:06:19,14 --> 00:06:24,26
He un to preschool at rush does be
right on the water's edge because

70
00:06:24,27 --> 00:06:27,16
that was the healthiest place for
him to be living in kings cross

71
00:06:28,57 --> 00:06:34,05
and he loved it and he stayed there one
extra year so that he started school.

72
00:06:34,21 --> 00:06:40,55
One year later and then he went to a
lara demonstration school. Which was.

73
00:06:42,86 --> 00:06:46,05
A school in the richmond
suburbs again and.

74
00:06:48,32 --> 00:06:54,17
It had a good effect on a mere india had
three male teachers through his primary

75
00:06:54,17 --> 00:06:54,50
school

76
00:06:56,20 --> 00:07:01,46
and he was able to relate for many hours a
day with a male which was great because

77
00:07:01,46 --> 00:07:08,22
he was being brought up by me alone. And.

78
00:07:08,24 --> 00:07:13,65
When he left when he left sydney at the
age of 12 in your retired schooling.

79
00:07:15,57 --> 00:07:17,36
He'd made it to vaucluse boys high

80
00:07:18,47 --> 00:07:21,46
but we just went for the merged

81
00:07:22,59 --> 00:07:27,35
and he didn't emerge again tried one
term at high school when he was 15

82
00:07:28,97 --> 00:07:30,93
and he didn't find it very inspiring.

83
00:07:32,33 --> 00:07:37,60
So he went on the helen caldicott.

84
00:07:37,62 --> 00:07:39,36
Bandwagon he used to sing

85
00:07:40,63 --> 00:07:47,63
when she spoke in her election campaign
and that's what he's chosen to do.

86
00:07:47,72 --> 00:07:56,36
He's just musician expressing
what's happening around.

87
00:07:59,27 --> 00:07:59,63
People's.

88
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,97
Because his education is so far ahead

89
00:08:06,97 --> 00:08:12,24
of anything that the education system
can possibly provide that it just.

90
00:08:13,64 --> 00:08:16,79
It just defies all curricula.

91
00:08:16,81 --> 00:08:30,42
Yeah.

92
00:08:31,70 --> 00:08:37,34
You know. No there isn't but you.

93
00:08:37,53 --> 00:08:44,35
And a lot of people.

94
00:08:44,36 --> 00:08:50,56
In nimbin you find when
you dance with opinions

95
00:08:50,56 --> 00:08:56,06
and people and don't exchange any words
you feel such high regard for them.

96
00:08:57,13 --> 00:09:01,24
You feel such a powerful bonding and then

97
00:09:01,24 --> 00:09:04,89
when you actually do exchange
words they're mostly good words

98
00:09:05,80 --> 00:09:07,41
and people have feelings for one another.

99
00:09:07,75 --> 00:09:13,54
They're recognizing each other's right
to exist and credibly and tolerant

100
00:09:14,65 --> 00:09:19,97
and. Have a trifle less fear
than most people out there.

101
00:09:22,10 --> 00:09:28,53
I like that.

102
00:09:29,61 --> 00:09:35,42
Because.

103
00:09:35,44 --> 00:09:40,21
How hard he was my first connection and
mountain out is just so beautiful.

104
00:09:42,56 --> 00:09:44,77
The forest in there is just so magnificent

105
00:09:46,50 --> 00:09:49,87
and my first connection with this
place was i stayed in a wooden dome.

106
00:09:50,96 --> 00:09:56,18
It was like a small cathedral
just so beautiful so well placed

107
00:09:56,18 --> 00:10:00,07
and filled with love and feeling. No.

108
00:10:00,41 --> 00:10:04,05
Great plains.

109
00:10:05,37 --> 00:10:07,38
This couldn't help

110
00:10:07,38 --> 00:10:14,28
but live as an icon my in my living in
sydney i could always look back to this

111
00:10:14,28 --> 00:10:16,61
and say this is this

112
00:10:24,32 --> 00:10:28,44
one significant for

113
00:10:33,09 --> 00:10:37,57
the forest is for me.

114
00:10:39,65 --> 00:10:42,98
Letting go of thinking of myself
as the centre of the universe

115
00:10:45,42 --> 00:10:52,36
and just becoming part of an
amazing array of creatures

116
00:10:53,79 --> 00:10:59,34
plants smell this birdsong

117
00:11:02,05 --> 00:11:03,67
lizards snake.

118
00:11:05,57 --> 00:11:13,36
I just love being here.

119
00:11:17,84 --> 00:11:18,02
Yes.

120
00:11:18,24 --> 00:11:22,68
Sometimes i walk along metres
through the night with no moon

121
00:11:24,90 --> 00:11:46,78
and i just walk through this
truly magical place who.

122
00:11:48,68 --> 00:11:52,92
You know.

123
00:11:52,93 --> 00:11:55,99
Is a kind of i think the religious
would call it a calling.

124
00:11:58,17 --> 00:11:59,91
For me is just there's in.

125
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:10,88
You're down there is a he's going
down to the waterhole i'd say.

126
00:12:10,90 --> 00:12:16,02
Yes it's good. It's.

127
00:12:18,79 --> 00:12:19,61
A taking responsibility

128
00:12:19,61 --> 00:12:26,17
and enjoying your life enjoying your life.

129
00:12:27,46 --> 00:12:31,26
Doing things that you know you should
be doing and getting a lot of joy

130
00:12:31,26 --> 00:12:37,63
and creative out of the creativity of i'm
doing a little permaculture hillside

131
00:12:39,48 --> 00:12:41,36
with bush food.

132
00:12:42,17 --> 00:12:47,13
And i'm evil damn at the bottom.

133
00:12:47,15 --> 00:12:55,11
With frogs on every night like
an amphitheatre these frogs.

134
00:12:55,13 --> 00:13:00,40
About 10 varieties just to
sing years of night for

135
00:13:01,89 --> 00:13:05,73
and the kind of thing

136
00:13:05,73 --> 00:13:09,24
that you can only have if you really love

137
00:13:09,24 --> 00:13:16,02
and you're prepared to protect basically
so that's the attitude i have

138
00:13:18,48 --> 00:13:28,07
heard.

139
00:13:29,98 --> 00:13:34,15
I'm still on the dole. You know and.

140
00:13:36,65 --> 00:13:43,00
I give massages twice a week.
Mondays and fridays in i do.

141
00:13:45,13 --> 00:13:47,61
Something from esoteric
knowledge of osteopathy.

142
00:13:48,26 --> 00:13:49,46
And she has to

143
00:13:50,43 --> 00:13:55,96
and i use my entire body for
delivery my feet my arms my elbows.

144
00:13:55,98 --> 00:13:59,18
And i bring a lot of structural
change in people's bodies.

145
00:14:01,67 --> 00:14:02,65
And i really enjoy doing that.

146
00:14:04,88 --> 00:14:08,54
I'm more concerned with moving
away from the attitude of.

147
00:14:08,55 --> 00:14:10,46
Money being really important.

148
00:14:11,99 --> 00:14:18,93
I'm more concerned with people actually
prove starting to produce food.

149
00:14:18,95 --> 00:14:20,05
Produce their own food

150
00:14:21,44 --> 00:14:26,52
that i think is more central
to focus upon you know.

151
00:14:26,84 --> 00:14:27,31
Food production

152
00:14:27,31 --> 00:14:43,96
and able to sustain yourself as

153
00:14:46,33 --> 00:14:50,51
it's been a rule subsidy
most certainly yes.

154
00:14:52,56 --> 00:14:53,76
Can you can i start again.

155
00:14:53,77 --> 00:15:00,62
Yes you know the goal is to create a rule

156
00:15:00,62 --> 00:15:06,49
subsidy and give people an
opportunity to branch out

157
00:15:07,43 --> 00:15:09,12
and start something totally fresh a new

158
00:15:09,12 --> 00:15:15,88
and that's the promise of aquarius
aquarius is a promise of fresh approach to

159
00:15:15,88 --> 00:15:17,28
things.

160
00:15:17,30 --> 00:15:22,09
And that's what the festival is
going to be showing it has to show

161
00:15:22,09 --> 00:15:24,54
that otherwise there's absolutely no hope

162
00:15:24,54 --> 00:15:28,59
but it has to be a new way of doing things

163
00:15:30,31 --> 00:15:34,00
and we've had so many wars in close
connection with one another.

164
00:15:34,44 --> 00:15:38,11
We haven't had a new resting period
between generations in peace.

165
00:15:38,86 --> 00:15:42,46
So our brains are a bit
scrambled if you go to the edge

166
00:15:42,46 --> 00:15:47,94
and you need to kill you need at least four
generations to recover press psyche to

167
00:15:47,94 --> 00:15:53,94
recover. So if we can't find health

168
00:15:53,94 --> 00:15:57,55
and well-being in the rainforest.
We're not going to find it anywhere.

169
00:16:01,39 --> 00:16:09,12
So you know people say.

170
00:16:09,14 --> 00:16:13,80
Best. Yeah.

171
00:16:15,23 --> 00:16:17,57
We have to drop of a hat.

172
00:16:17,70 --> 00:16:22,87
We celebrate celebrate
anything and everything and.

173
00:16:23,87 --> 00:16:25,89
We have minister of the cultural affairs

174
00:16:27,83 --> 00:16:33,08
and he ensures a healthy number
of dancers get togethers

175
00:16:33,08 --> 00:16:43,80
and places for display.

176
00:16:45,63 --> 00:16:52,44
Yes.

177
00:16:52,46 --> 00:16:56,20
Yes we're kind of here together.
And we want to have a good time.

178
00:16:57,90 --> 00:17:02,74
Yeah. This is such a beautiful planet.

179
00:17:03,55 --> 00:17:06,41
It's such a mistake to have anything
else other than a very good time.
