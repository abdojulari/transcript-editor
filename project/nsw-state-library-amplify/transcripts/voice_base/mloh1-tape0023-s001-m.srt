1
00:00:03,20 --> 00:00:03,97
I'm speaking to mr.

2
00:00:03,97 --> 00:00:10,38
Alf shields who worked in the like
workshops on the sydney harbour bridge.

3
00:00:11,67 --> 00:00:14,75
When you worked on the on the
harbour bridge for dorman long. Mr.

4
00:00:14,75 --> 00:00:18,66
Shields. Do you remember. Did you come out
here from england specially to get the

5
00:00:18,66 --> 00:00:25,34
job. Now. No i didn't
really i came out in 1926.

6
00:00:25,36 --> 00:00:26,19
Just to find

7
00:00:26,19 --> 00:00:33,08
a new home for my mother and family. And
do you remember getting the job done

8
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:39,92
and long as i do. I remember my mother
packed up some lunch for me and

9
00:00:41,77 --> 00:00:47,95
she said you might try again at the harbour
bridge and might be some vacancies. So

10
00:00:47,96 --> 00:00:54,77
i caught the tram and then the ferry to
miss and sprint and i had to wait outside

11
00:00:55,90 --> 00:00:59,15
an office that has sat in charge of mr.

12
00:00:59,15 --> 00:01:06,02
Martin. One of the angin is
at work under the bridge

13
00:01:06,76 --> 00:01:13,66
and i saw her eight or nine chaps
coming out from the door with. What i

14
00:01:13,66 --> 00:01:19,37
would say crestfallen faces and i thought
well that they're not putting anybody on

15
00:01:19,37 --> 00:01:25,99
today. So i haven't much happened and then
it came my turn to go in and. Without

16
00:01:25,99 --> 00:01:32,07
going into too many details. Mr martin
asked me if i knew anything about bridge

17
00:01:32,07 --> 00:01:38,78
building and i said not really so. I
said i have been on small bridges

18
00:01:40,02 --> 00:01:46,61
when with the who are engineers in
the british army but of course those

19
00:01:46,62 --> 00:01:52,47
small bridges were just child's play. And
i'm afraid i didn't learn much. But i

20
00:01:52,47 --> 00:01:55,28
like this there. So what it is

21
00:01:55,28 --> 00:02:00,97
a do give me the job anyway.
So anyway he said well it's

22
00:02:00,97 --> 00:02:07,61
a. For being so forthright that you
admit you know nothing about the bench.

23
00:02:09,00 --> 00:02:09,46
I'll keep here

24
00:02:09,46 --> 00:02:15,88
a three months. Trial and few don't
know anything but in three months.

25
00:02:16,11 --> 00:02:21,82
I'm not hoping you would have to go. So he
said you can start to morrow. And i was

26
00:02:21,82 --> 00:02:28,70
overjoyed how going back to the place
where i lived at bond i and torrid

27
00:02:28,70 --> 00:02:33,18
money and of course we made preparations
that i shouldn't miss missed the early

28
00:02:33,18 --> 00:02:36,22
train. So i could be there at mrs.

29
00:02:36,22 --> 00:02:42,66
Point at 7:30. The next morning.
And you did take up the job.

30
00:02:43,14 --> 00:02:50,03
Yes i took up the job i was introduced
to but i only remember has been

31
00:02:50,03 --> 00:02:55,50
frank she that was his nickname and
i was very pleased to be able to

32
00:02:56,88 --> 00:02:58,37
summon her parents

33
00:02:58,37 --> 00:03:03,80
a new all their answers to everything
connected with that the cranes and dogma and

34
00:03:04,70 --> 00:03:10,08
. Work in bars and the talk that it was
your job while you were working at the

35
00:03:10,08 --> 00:03:15,76
workshops there but i was more or less so.
I was classified as a document. Under

36
00:03:15,76 --> 00:03:20,95
a train she at that time and
that i found that he was

37
00:03:20,95 --> 00:03:27,03
a most. Willing worker
and. Willing to show me

38
00:03:27,86 --> 00:03:33,02
a pic hanging that was required
in the way of knots and

39
00:03:33,03 --> 00:03:39,77
a way to sling happy that is without
any any danger to those working

40
00:03:39,77 --> 00:03:45,96
in the workshops. So you would
actually sling and dogman for the

41
00:03:45,96 --> 00:03:52,08
drivers who handled the plates in
the workshop where. You such a and

42
00:03:52,08 --> 00:03:55,74
b. I might add the crane drivers

43
00:03:55,74 --> 00:04:01,92
a course. I'd get the same train driver
week after week month after month

44
00:04:02,71 --> 00:04:08,58
and what we got to know again. And although
the claims of so high up. You could

45
00:04:08,58 --> 00:04:12,65
really. Pick out the outlines
of his face just sort of

46
00:04:12,65 --> 00:04:19,00
a blur. But you knew that it was the same
chat and where to talk to each other

47
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:25,86
in sign language and at times it was quite
funny and humorous and what do you say

48
00:04:25,86 --> 00:04:32,17
in sign language. Well they the
client either would look down on the

49
00:04:32,96 --> 00:04:34,06
. Perhaps

50
00:04:34,90 --> 00:04:41,16
a rather large girder and shake
his head which meant to tell us

51
00:04:42,00 --> 00:04:47,97
that when he heis up. What angus going
to be happy. Alec might be dangerous

52
00:04:49,22 --> 00:04:55,34
and. We but shake hands and pull
out a ten bob note or perhaps

53
00:04:55,34 --> 00:05:00,75
a pound that as much as to say we're
back to it's okay. And he'd pull out his

54
00:05:01,99 --> 00:05:08,92
wallet and. And indicate that it was
quite ok. And then when he lifted up

55
00:05:09,64 --> 00:05:10,75
and found that they carried

56
00:05:10,75 --> 00:05:17,74
a little it up even let both
hands. How used to pretend

57
00:05:17,74 --> 00:05:18,36
to pull out

58
00:05:18,36 --> 00:05:25,14
a pound note and talk to us and things like
that occurred. Quite often during that

59
00:05:25,14 --> 00:05:27,03
day and seemed to add a bit of

60
00:05:27,03 --> 00:05:33,19
a bit of humor to the whole situation
although not deterring us from from doing the

61
00:05:33,19 --> 00:05:40,09
work that we were told to do. Do you
remember any dangerous moments that

62
00:05:40,09 --> 00:05:46,30
happened while you were there. Yes
there was one occasion when we had

63
00:05:46,30 --> 00:05:52,96
a curtain to turn round for the drill as
it had been drilled and our job was to set

64
00:05:52,96 --> 00:05:58,72
it right over so that the. Who am in job.

65
00:05:59,62 --> 00:06:06,04
Stunned by the drill as what but take all
the rough edges off the holes and on

66
00:06:06,04 --> 00:06:11,34
one occasion the highest started working.

67
00:06:13,16 --> 00:06:18,64
And my hands were underneath that until

68
00:06:18,64 --> 00:06:23,48
a thick chains and tighten
up all the time and i looked

69
00:06:23,48 --> 00:06:30,14
a bit afraid she said i didn't call
out to him that he saw apparently

70
00:06:31,25 --> 00:06:31,83
just in time

71
00:06:32,73 --> 00:06:39,58
a look of fear in my eyes and hear mediately
blow his whistle and the ropes and

72
00:06:39,59 --> 00:06:45,83
chains second and i found that my hands
although you could see that they'd been

73
00:06:45,83 --> 00:06:51,49
trapped. They were not hurt. They were just
barely. Superficially bruised and i was

74
00:06:51,49 --> 00:06:58,21
very very thankful and i sort of get
this band called fancy as probably

75
00:06:58,21 --> 00:07:02,98
the most alert dog man that i
would ever hope to bump against

76
00:07:05,21 --> 00:07:10,11
to member any other incidents where people
got hurt in the workshops. Yes there was

77
00:07:10,11 --> 00:07:12,16
another occasion when

78
00:07:12,17 --> 00:07:19,07
a trailer. One of the jealous much
burned senses and he slipped and

79
00:07:19,07 --> 00:07:25,61
he fell between the drill and his trousers
got caught and ripped ripped off and

80
00:07:26,66 --> 00:07:33,42
in the bent he lost one of his testicles
and i remember the anders chaps coming as

81
00:07:33,42 --> 00:07:40,38
a token white and i learnt subsequently
that he had only lost one of his testicles

82
00:07:41,27 --> 00:07:48,12
and that his married life but not then
have been granted. Hopeless in that sense.

83
00:07:51,22 --> 00:07:56,17
Then as he did have another child that he.
Yes i did hear that he had a spot had

84
00:07:56,17 --> 00:08:01,37
a child after that and i think that most
of the chaps in the workshop were very

85
00:08:01,37 --> 00:08:08,32
pleased about that. You were involved
in any. In any escapes lucky escapes

86
00:08:08,32 --> 00:08:14,15
yourself. Yes. Only one is ah well the
band i've already mentioned of course but

87
00:08:15,50 --> 00:08:22,22
i was going towards the
mapping shop on some some

88
00:08:22,22 --> 00:08:26,69
business or other which i forget. And i was
making my way there because one of the

89
00:08:26,69 --> 00:08:32,14
foremen and you mean the template
loved you. Yes the template

90
00:08:33,21 --> 00:08:34,86
lifetime. It was

91
00:08:34,86 --> 00:08:41,13
a huge spirit and where all the plans
were laid out to be ready for the

92
00:08:41,13 --> 00:08:44,87
boilermakers and we have

93
00:08:44,87 --> 00:08:49,89
a not very far from the door
of the template shop when

94
00:08:51,31 --> 00:08:58,08
a heist. Disengaged itself from the
horses and came down. I suppose

95
00:08:59,09 --> 00:09:05,47
. September or eighty five feet. Whatever
distance was and it completely bad itself

96
00:09:05,47 --> 00:09:11,93
in the ground. About ten feet from where
we're standing and i recall that the

97
00:09:12,83 --> 00:09:19,01
fireman looked at me and i looked at him
and we didn't say anything but i must have

98
00:09:19,01 --> 00:09:23,46
thought as he must have thought as hard it
that we were both very lucky that there

99
00:09:23,46 --> 00:09:28,89
weren't any closer when lights for got hit
hit by it and would have been attracted

100
00:09:28,89 --> 00:09:34,25
to member the working conditions in the
shop that it was it noisy was it dirty what

101
00:09:34,25 --> 00:09:38,08
was that it was like.
Well yes of course. In

102
00:09:38,08 --> 00:09:44,53
a workshop at that nature.
You had steel pilings steel

103
00:09:44,55 --> 00:09:50,37
a shavings from the trailers. And dirt
and dust and and stuff like that.

104
00:09:51,18 --> 00:09:57,94
Good but to be. In any type of workshop
where they would get the same kind of

105
00:09:57,94 --> 00:10:04,80
conditions and as we were handling
stay there all day long when

106
00:10:06,14 --> 00:10:12,52
we couldn't wear gloves because they
impeded the usefulness of your hands in

107
00:10:12,52 --> 00:10:17,08
fixing the the chain. So
i had to steal horses

108
00:10:19,74 --> 00:10:25,92
. To such an extent that we
improvised by getting me some

109
00:10:25,92 --> 00:10:32,58
stout stout hash in. Hash and. Much

110
00:10:33,49 --> 00:10:35,53
of the same texture was a as a as

111
00:10:35,53 --> 00:10:42,13
a concept about nine inches square
whatever made it to slits and it

112
00:10:42,82 --> 00:10:48,80
and we were able to put these on and they
took the brunt and the rough notes right

113
00:10:48,80 --> 00:10:55,35
to stay you know where are handling and i
think we had to make two or three to last

114
00:10:55,35 --> 00:11:01,49
a whole week. And by that method. Lee
didn't get our hands time with the sharp

115
00:11:01,49 --> 00:11:06,30
pieces of steel and the sharp edges
of the courtesies and plates.

116
00:11:08,58 --> 00:11:13,84
Do you remember any of the machines working
around you or in the in the shop or in

117
00:11:13,84 --> 00:11:18,01
the dejection shops. Yes. That was

118
00:11:18,01 --> 00:11:24,77
a guillotine at the end of the shop.
Which was it were and of course

119
00:11:24,77 --> 00:11:30,45
all day long. It only worked when
they had to cut stair plates to

120
00:11:30,45 --> 00:11:36,88
a certain size and when the
nissan was working. Cutting

121
00:11:37,60 --> 00:11:44,28
steel so to insist check that tries
to shake and i often wondered

122
00:11:46,45 --> 00:11:49,62
. What would happen if they'd had half

123
00:11:49,62 --> 00:11:55,30
a dozen of those hussein's working all
at once. I'm quite sure that they their

124
00:11:55,31 --> 00:11:57,01
effect would have been like

125
00:11:57,01 --> 00:12:03,81
a small earthquake. Did you ever see
any river thing going on around

126
00:12:03,81 --> 00:12:10,73
the place. Yes has not attacked.
I went went to there happens to

127
00:12:10,73 --> 00:12:17,19
have your workshop. I'm on occasion
and my younger brother have

128
00:12:17,20 --> 00:12:20,04
a sense of dentally that put on action

129
00:12:20,04 --> 00:12:26,02
a pantheist i think as an apprentice paul
and i stay out of work of some kind.

130
00:12:27,08 --> 00:12:27,44
He was only

131
00:12:27,44 --> 00:12:35,32
a very young chap and he was engaged
in. Throwing up the hot rivets to

132
00:12:35,32 --> 00:12:41,32
a chat about him about ten feet above him
and then the chap who took the rivets

133
00:12:41,32 --> 00:12:47,48
from him. What place them into

134
00:12:48,39 --> 00:12:54,79
rabbit hole and the river to stand with
people worked with it. The white hot or

135
00:12:54,79 --> 00:12:56,13
that hot rivets

136
00:12:57,28 --> 00:13:02,83
a say about required and that was only
time i saw the riveting being done because

137
00:13:02,83 --> 00:13:07,73
i'd gone up to see my brother to ask if he
was going to do any overtime so that i'd

138
00:13:07,73 --> 00:13:13,06
know if he wasn't on my farrier
about that you know where he was

139
00:13:15,13 --> 00:13:21,32
. Do you remember the times. When any of
the incidents you remember around the

140
00:13:21,33 --> 00:13:26,87
workshops at all. Was

141
00:13:26,87 --> 00:13:33,63
a seal. Do you get put off the harbour
bridge. You know i left on my own accord

142
00:13:34,35 --> 00:13:36,10
. I had heard that they have

143
00:13:36,10 --> 00:13:42,80
a job for me working with the aryan
nation commission in in griffith.

144
00:13:43,43 --> 00:13:44,89
So i thought it would be

145
00:13:44,89 --> 00:13:50,52
a change and i would say that more of new
south wales. So i left at dawn and longs

146
00:13:50,52 --> 00:13:55,50
i think i've got a. How
can a letter from mr.

147
00:13:55,50 --> 00:13:57,92
Martin in the buyout

148
00:14:02,34 --> 00:14:03,35
if it's in the way of

149
00:14:03,35 --> 00:14:09,00
a reference to say the great and the heart
beats for us for so many months. I think

150
00:14:09,00 --> 00:14:15,91
it was eighteen months altogether. And
then i left to go onto this job and

151
00:14:15,91 --> 00:14:22,08
i was only there about three months and i
discovered that they were putting chaps

152
00:14:22,08 --> 00:14:28,01
off. So this up i wrote were these
sad to me i'm afraid our police said

153
00:14:29,57 --> 00:14:35,39
that they're putting off all the single men
only keeping on the mad men. So i said

154
00:14:35,39 --> 00:14:42,27
i said i suppose i don't have to go
dataset and got another job so i got

155
00:14:42,27 --> 00:14:49,08
my last paycheck from those people.
And i like them to to set me where i

156
00:14:50,45 --> 00:14:57,41
managed to get work painting
houses and i remember very well

157
00:14:57,41 --> 00:15:03,90
on one occasion i was painting the
house and i was up the ladder in the

158
00:15:03,90 --> 00:15:07,90
gutter. Rather i think about it was

159
00:15:07,90 --> 00:15:14,58
a double extension ladder and i
was right up to the top and that

160
00:15:14,58 --> 00:15:20,28
the chaps taught i came out. They can't
communicate me the job in the first place.

161
00:15:21,86 --> 00:15:28,58
Heh heh i owned a racehorse and
his daughter came out in rather

162
00:15:28,58 --> 00:15:33,56
a hurry and she shook the level at the
bottom. And i thought she was going to tell

163
00:15:33,56 --> 00:15:40,09
me something about this racehorse but she
said miss alone hasn't cut the bridge

164
00:15:40,09 --> 00:15:46,99
after all it was done by an army
officer. And i said well. I was

165
00:15:46,99 --> 00:15:51,95
too far up above the ground to reply to
her that. When she went inside. I thought

166
00:15:51,95 --> 00:15:55,37
to myself it's had all she
was going to tell very it's

167
00:15:55,37 --> 00:16:02,03
a nearly knocked me off the ladder. But
at the time i was very upset. Tell

168
00:16:02,03 --> 00:16:07,57
teller and i've the fact that some
army officer had cut the ribbon as

169
00:16:07,57 --> 00:16:14,05
a sort of bravado act and i think it all
fit in with some kind of political stuff

170
00:16:14,06 --> 00:16:19,85
happens. Going on at that time. Where did
you go to work after that when did you.

171
00:16:19,90 --> 00:16:20,24
Next get

172
00:16:20,24 --> 00:16:27,57
a job.

173
00:16:27,59 --> 00:16:28,40
It was

174
00:16:28,40 --> 00:16:33,89
a sales it's fifty years later now and you
worked on building the bridge. What do

175
00:16:33,89 --> 00:16:39,75
you think of the idea of putting extra
lines on it and i don't really think it's

176
00:16:39,75 --> 00:16:40,41
a good idea

177
00:16:40,41 --> 00:16:46,78
a good idea at all. In
laws in my ways and one.

178
00:16:47,85 --> 00:16:48,50
It could be

179
00:16:48,50 --> 00:16:55,20
a very tragic mistake in the sense that
two more lines would would mean two more

180
00:16:55,20 --> 00:17:01,80
lots of lines of cars going through
impose their actions and it would appear

181
00:17:01,80 --> 00:17:08,52
that. Much more traffic and.
Much more air pollution

182
00:17:08,52 --> 00:17:13,06
would take place because a lot of
people with extra people would use

183
00:17:13,06 --> 00:17:18,42
a bridge. Knowing that they better
extra lines but but but surely

184
00:17:18,42 --> 00:17:25,08
a big set was designed for what it was.
For the purpose of carrying carpet

185
00:17:25,08 --> 00:17:31,17
which in in the early days was trams
and rather a tactic. Which is now

186
00:17:31,17 --> 00:17:37,95
a rabbi and bridge. Bus
traffic. Surely their badges on

187
00:17:37,95 --> 00:17:40,13
the page might very well be

188
00:17:40,13 --> 00:17:47,04
a spa. Part by by adding terex
to lines that the whole concept

189
00:17:48,01 --> 00:17:48,54
was built as

190
00:17:48,54 --> 00:17:54,87
a bridge and if you're going to do that
the harbour bridge. Why not. There's

191
00:17:54,87 --> 00:17:58,82
a pretty big bridge in the
whole world. Just to get

192
00:17:58,82 --> 00:18:03,64
a pier extra cars going across in both
directions. It doesn't seem to me to be

193
00:18:03,64 --> 00:18:10,33
a good idea at all. Thank you. Is
to our shield. Do you remember the

194
00:18:10,33 --> 00:18:17,05
accuracy with which the job was
done. Well yes of course when the

195
00:18:17,05 --> 00:18:21,90
steel girders came from the template room
and the boilermakers had their job to do

196
00:18:21,90 --> 00:18:28,83
and then of course our job was to take
the boilermakers. Stay out of sheets.

197
00:18:28,85 --> 00:18:35,69
I wanted to drills to be drilled.
And on not very often. Of course on

198
00:18:35,69 --> 00:18:41,82
very rare occasions. Someone had blundered
and the steel holes may have been in the

199
00:18:41,82 --> 00:18:48,32
wrong places. And that whole steel
sheet was then trying to get

200
00:18:49,12 --> 00:18:51,09
towards the harbour put on

201
00:18:51,09 --> 00:18:56,66
a ship and dumped in the middle of the
harbor and happily i could say that while i

202
00:18:56,66 --> 00:19:01,31
was on the beach and i wasn't there for
the whole time that it was being built.

203
00:19:02,64 --> 00:19:02,93
Just a few

204
00:19:02,93 --> 00:19:09,95
a few months perhaps twelve months. I.
I only saw turkey's ins where errors

205
00:19:09,95 --> 00:19:16,36
had been made. And. I suppose a member
diamonds get shot. If he was in

206
00:19:16,36 --> 00:19:20,62
a position to bit to be able to put some
party or something in the holes and

207
00:19:20,62 --> 00:19:25,64
painted over to make it look as open as
okay. That thing of course never would have

208
00:19:25,64 --> 00:19:30,61
occurred on the hop if it's but as i say
when missiles were made the whole lot was

209
00:19:30,61 --> 00:19:31,47
dumped in the middle of

210
00:19:31,47 --> 00:19:38,04
a harbor. Do you member any rivets
being cut out. No no i don't remember

211
00:19:38,04 --> 00:19:43,21
anything at that nature her in that or to
him what the working conditions were like

212
00:19:43,21 --> 00:19:50,20
in the shops. But their working conditions
were such that at 4:50 our police were

213
00:19:50,20 --> 00:19:55,97
black and you had ten minutes to wash your
hands and to wash and we had plenty of

214
00:19:55,97 --> 00:19:59,74
water there because you turn the
tap on dipped your hands in

215
00:19:59,74 --> 00:20:06,46
a big bucket of soft soap wash your hands
tired and then by that time they would

216
00:20:06,46 --> 00:20:11,96
have arrived at millicent's point and you
get onto the ferry boat and so make your

217
00:20:11,96 --> 00:20:18,17
way home and as far as the contestants but
their players to just sit and anywhere.

218
00:20:18,29 --> 00:20:18,69
Eat

219
00:20:18,69 --> 00:20:23,57
a sandwiches after washing their hands of
course because by hand and stare and stare

220
00:20:23,57 --> 00:20:29,86
or shavings and steel spent as would be
around and it's makes sure that they didn't

221
00:20:29,86 --> 00:20:35,71
swallow any of those. Do you remember what
the floor was like what was it like was

222
00:20:35,71 --> 00:20:42,55
it windy there for there were all the
pictures i've seen the walls only come down

223
00:20:42,55 --> 00:20:44,10
so far and it was

224
00:20:44,10 --> 00:20:47,30
a dirt floor i mean i was wonder what
it was like when it was windy in the

225
00:20:47,30 --> 00:20:50,99
workshops. And yes there was

226
00:20:50,99 --> 00:20:57,59
a flaw throughout the whole workshops the
heavy shot and also the like shop and

227
00:20:57,59 --> 00:20:58,41
as far as

228
00:20:58,41 --> 00:21:05,05
a wind was concerned. Bear in mind that
the steel shavings those that couldn't be

229
00:21:05,77 --> 00:21:12,67
swept up in. And place in banks for
disposal but trent into the ground and by

230
00:21:12,67 --> 00:21:14,35
by virtue of the fact that

231
00:21:14,35 --> 00:21:19,36
a lot of all of this used to show up in
the drills and he used the germs in the

232
00:21:19,36 --> 00:21:26,12
stair plates that the ground became
fairly solid and firm and i can't i

233
00:21:26,12 --> 00:21:32,48
can't recollect any time of bang and
convenience but dust flying around there never

234
00:21:32,48 --> 00:21:39,23
was any dust cloud as far as i can
remember. Yes i have opt-in being asked

235
00:21:39,23 --> 00:21:46,21
what i felt. Like working on the
bridge. Did i throw my chest out

236
00:21:46,21 --> 00:21:50,50
and say yes i worked on the beach or i
was working on the beach. Well of course

237
00:21:50,50 --> 00:21:57,31
everybody had seen that afternoon's
picture of the bridge the drawing itself

238
00:21:58,03 --> 00:21:58,42
which looked

239
00:21:58,42 --> 00:22:07,09
a very very beautiful affair. And
one could be sure i said that the.

240
00:22:07,10 --> 00:22:13,69
There chaps on the drawing boards could
see in their innermost eye. What that

241
00:22:13,69 --> 00:22:20,47
beautiful page was going to present to
the public. And. It did make us feel

242
00:22:21,24 --> 00:22:27,27
rather proud to work on the bridge because
we knew that it was worth our job ever

243
00:22:27,27 --> 00:22:33,93
come by passengers and be the means of
conveying people from one part of sydney to

244
00:22:33,93 --> 00:22:40,84
the other in quick time to members
talking with the others about being

245
00:22:40,84 --> 00:22:46,48
glad that you got the tender. Yes i
remember on the carrier that one day

246
00:22:46,48 --> 00:22:49,25
a chap assigned to me. It's

247
00:22:49,26 --> 00:22:54,28
a bit lucky that we've got time on long
to build in the biz because the americans

248
00:22:54,28 --> 00:23:01,17
putting attend and. If they've won won the

249
00:23:01,17 --> 00:23:05,87
tender and started work there i wonder
what kind of age where we would have had

250
00:23:06,58 --> 00:23:12,84
what it would have been at the same.
Symmetrical proportions and the same period.

251
00:23:13,96 --> 00:23:19,83
It's very hard to say then. But with it all
very glad in that sense that an english

252
00:23:19,83 --> 00:23:20,61
firm had got it.
