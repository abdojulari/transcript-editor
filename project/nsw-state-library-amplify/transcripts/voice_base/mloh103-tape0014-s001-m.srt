1
00:00:16,84 --> 00:00:18,93
I'm please they grew up in here

2
00:00:18,94 --> 00:00:25,90
and i don't know i am i'm

3
00:00:25,90 --> 00:00:29,64
just sort of places that i mean i wouldn't
among them grow up anywhere else.

4
00:00:29,91 --> 00:00:34,12
Probably because this is my
home. I've been never home.

5
00:00:36,24 --> 00:00:43,62
And we had no trouble with them.

6
00:00:46,78 --> 00:00:50,36
Well one of the real the real things i
would have been exposed to was drugs

7
00:00:50,36 --> 00:00:55,80
but not at that festival time like that
was later sort of in the years to come

8
00:00:57,14 --> 00:01:01,43
but i must say that up until i
actually left time and then came back

9
00:01:01,43 --> 00:01:06,63
that they were never offered drugs and
they were you know it was up there

10
00:01:06,63 --> 00:01:08,51
but the truth.

11
00:01:08,63 --> 00:01:12,85
All lies years of being young students
here they were never ever offered drugs by

12
00:01:12,85 --> 00:01:16,30
anybody but they were out there
and i knew they were out there

13
00:01:17,46 --> 00:01:25,99
and i think just.

14
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:30,76
Well even long live was a lot of drainage
people so that sort of taught them

15
00:01:30,76 --> 00:01:35,82
that they had to be very careful of who
they talk to or who they got to know.

16
00:01:37,47 --> 00:01:40,86
So that sort of made them for that much
better in their lives that they knew

17
00:01:40,86 --> 00:01:45,08
that you know you didn't
trust any everybody.

18
00:01:47,14 --> 00:01:51,80
But then again like i said
we were lucky we had them.

19
00:01:54,51 --> 00:01:57,46
You know people would come here to
the house and that sort of things

20
00:01:57,46 --> 00:02:02,23
that they sort of grew up with
a. I've started of the fence.

21
00:02:02,38 --> 00:02:05,35
You know we went we
went to paradise valley

22
00:02:05,35 --> 00:02:07,54
and had dinner with friends out there

23
00:02:07,54 --> 00:02:13,02
that we got to know we had people come here
off the communes to have meals with us.

24
00:02:13,12 --> 00:02:14,12
We've been to tangible

25
00:02:14,12 --> 00:02:19,52
and took the children with just so you
know that's why i think they got to know

26
00:02:19,52 --> 00:02:22,67
that there wasn't the most and
just a straight line in life

27
00:02:22,67 --> 00:02:24,36
that there was two sides to it and

28
00:02:25,48 --> 00:02:29,80
and both sides could be quite
pleasant if you look at it.

29
00:02:34,13 --> 00:02:38,55
The two girls and the two older
girls live in this in lismore.

30
00:02:40,41 --> 00:02:44,35
But they were married and
they went in there to live

31
00:02:44,35 --> 00:02:46,86
and they've all got the
four lost two husbands

32
00:02:46,86 --> 00:02:51,13
and the two wives got
jobs in this analyst.

33
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:53,70
They're quite happy to live in jail

34
00:02:53,70 --> 00:02:58,00
and i'll be home on thursday because
she's at college and i am a da

35
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:02,95
and that was her choice
that she you know and

36
00:03:02,95 --> 00:03:09,74
that she wanted to have a brighter
life from neiman she was probably the

37
00:03:09,74 --> 00:03:10,68
one that was born.

38
00:03:10,94 --> 00:03:13,93
And she doesn't know the other side
of nimbin because she was born like

39
00:03:13,93 --> 00:03:15,08
that in the or with them.

40
00:03:15,11 --> 00:03:22,07
That people arrived in so she only knows a
lot of nimbin as it is now not as it was

41
00:03:22,07 --> 00:03:26,99
before and that was
probably the other thing

42
00:03:26,99 --> 00:03:31,70
that was a fear for me was before
the festival your kids could go

43
00:03:31,70 --> 00:03:35,12
and be away an hour and you knew that
they were either talking to an aunt

44
00:03:35,12 --> 00:03:38,73
or an up or an old friend where
if they were gone for 10 minutes.

45
00:03:38,91 --> 00:03:44,89
You were concerned as you know that you
know where are they. Who's got them.

46
00:03:46,51 --> 00:03:47,20
And that because

47
00:03:47,20 --> 00:03:52,65
that was a fear for me personally having
three young children where before that

48
00:03:52,65 --> 00:03:55,87
that was probably a different
a change in nimbin for me

49
00:03:55,87 --> 00:03:59,84
that before the festival of my children
could be gone for an hour up this.

50
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,52
Right after that if they
were gone for five minutes.

51
00:04:02,81 --> 00:04:09,13
I would be going to see where they
were so that changed my life in

52
00:04:09,13 --> 00:04:09,67
that respect

53
00:04:09,67 --> 00:04:17,75
that i had to be more aware where my
children were than i was before i

54
00:04:19,28 --> 00:04:25,28
was young people on drugs.

55
00:04:25,41 --> 00:04:28,92
It would have to be my.

56
00:04:30,37 --> 00:04:36,90
I said it's moments in the
nt and i think i've got it.

57
00:04:36,93 --> 00:04:40,11
I've got a lot of fond memories
of the festival and after but

58
00:04:40,11 --> 00:04:43,42
that would have to be i
think the saddest thing

59
00:04:43,42 --> 00:04:48,18
that i do see is young people been
blown away by drugs and it would.

60
00:04:51,22 --> 00:04:52,37
If i could round them all up

61
00:04:52,37 --> 00:04:57,13
and say come on we're going
to get right away from this.

62
00:04:57,94 --> 00:05:01,43
It wouldn't have to be the
thing that i would change in

63
00:05:01,43 --> 00:05:08,19
that change.

64
00:05:08,91 --> 00:05:12,02
Yes that. It.

65
00:05:12,97 --> 00:05:16,30
It wasn't here with the festival
and i wouldn't say that.

66
00:05:19,23 --> 00:05:20,65
Not the heavy stuff.

67
00:05:20,67 --> 00:05:25,13
But after the first one i think we found
a little pot of marijuana growing it rip

68
00:05:25,99 --> 00:05:31,93
around like which people were
probably having a smoke around.

69
00:05:31,95 --> 00:05:36,53
That's their business and
that is their concern.

70
00:05:39,22 --> 00:05:41,23
But i think then it came to dealing.

71
00:05:41,35 --> 00:05:44,78
But i think that's probably only
happened sort of say in 10 years.

72
00:05:44,85 --> 00:05:49,63
The last 10 years where we've got
the dealer coming into town and

73
00:05:49,63 --> 00:05:54,80
that sort of thing where i mean
it's the same as anything else

74
00:05:54,80 --> 00:05:59,56
that if you've just got it.
People want to have a cigarette.

75
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,25
Marijuana whatever they call
it that is their business.

76
00:06:05,65 --> 00:06:08,34
But i do i think the line
should be drawn somewhere

77
00:06:08,34 --> 00:06:11,90
that people are selling it to
other people's children that

78
00:06:11,90 --> 00:06:16,27
that is as a very big
concern of mine you know

79
00:06:17,36 --> 00:06:23,08
and like i said i don't know what i would
have done had i had of sort of had them

80
00:06:23,08 --> 00:06:24,97
offering it to mine but i can say

81
00:06:24,97 --> 00:06:29,53
that it never happened until now it's
happening that they've gone away

82
00:06:29,53 --> 00:06:34,42
and they're coming back and they are sort
of rising up to them now on the street

83
00:06:34,42 --> 00:06:39,90
and saying they want to buy it but up
until then it was never offered to them

84
00:06:39,90 --> 00:06:44,76
but that would be my saddest thing about
an in-born is that it is out there

85
00:06:44,76 --> 00:06:51,06
and i so young lives been destroyed by it.

86
00:06:52,39 --> 00:06:55,08
Not you know i couldn't say i have.

87
00:06:56,90 --> 00:06:58,12
But i think if you live here

88
00:06:58,12 --> 00:07:02,86
and in such a small community yes it touches
you personally just to see any one's

89
00:07:02,86 --> 00:07:08,71
child. You can stand back and say well
i don't care because you do care.

90
00:07:10,81 --> 00:07:11,12
And.

91
00:07:14,63 --> 00:07:19,86
I just said you know it is it's really an
truly stand to see if some of those kids

92
00:07:19,86 --> 00:07:20,65
up there are so young

93
00:07:22,14 --> 00:07:26,14
and i think if we you know just
like to see the deals be taken away

94
00:07:26,14 --> 00:07:30,49
and i'm sure we'd be that that
is our problem now we've got it

95
00:07:30,49 --> 00:07:33,79
and i don't know i don't
know how to fix it

96
00:07:33,79 --> 00:07:36,65
and i think that's the most
aggravating part of it

97
00:07:36,65 --> 00:07:38,36
that you don't know i
had it fix it yourself

98
00:07:38,36 --> 00:07:43,74
and you don't know if anyone else
can fix it either. You know.

99
00:07:49,06 --> 00:07:54,09
A half as you know i think i think it's it
is it will be we just don't know how to

100
00:07:54,09 --> 00:07:59,92
deal with it any of it you know we can
talk about it and say well. And i suppose.

101
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,40
We can all sort of try and
blame other people for it

102
00:08:02,40 --> 00:08:05,74
but that's not fixing it is that you know
and we don't mean it were and i think

103
00:08:05,74 --> 00:08:10,25
that is why we do try and pass the
blame on this one or that one

104
00:08:10,25 --> 00:08:11,19
or someone else inside.

105
00:08:12,54 --> 00:08:17,17
If we didn't have a festival it wouldn't
have happened if we didn't do this or

106
00:08:17,17 --> 00:08:20,53
that what wouldn't have happened but it
is happening. And that's not the point.

107
00:08:20,71 --> 00:08:23,99
We've got and we were just south helpless
we don't know what to do about it

108
00:08:25,60 --> 00:08:30,29
and maybe will never be able to fix it.

109
00:08:30,32 --> 00:08:34,97
I don't know but it is a concern
that would have to be my biggest

110
00:08:34,97 --> 00:08:38,04
that every my saddest thing
about living in the main thing

111
00:08:44,28 --> 00:08:51,04
is you know i just think living in

112
00:08:51,04 --> 00:08:58,04
is like i've had my life has been good

113
00:08:58,04 --> 00:09:01,63
and it's because i live here.
I've got a good husband.

114
00:09:01,94 --> 00:09:05,77
I had read three beautiful
children and i've had a good job.

115
00:09:05,92 --> 00:09:09,56
I work with good people and you know i
thought oh my life in general has been good.

116
00:09:09,74 --> 00:09:12,75
Like i said and i think

117
00:09:13,81 --> 00:09:16,56
and i don't think i could have been
happier if i'd lived anywhere or so

118
00:09:18,09 --> 00:09:26,94
and it was very what is.

119
00:09:26,96 --> 00:09:28,83
This.

120
00:09:28,85 --> 00:09:33,45
You know not really you know i
just think it's nimbin nimbin

121
00:09:33,45 --> 00:09:40,60
and i don't think i could say well.

122
00:09:40,61 --> 00:09:44,46
How to describe it it's just it's
got a there's a drawcard to it.

123
00:09:45,56 --> 00:09:47,73
But like i said if you haven't
got a sense of humor you

124
00:09:47,73 --> 00:09:53,14
that live here you've got to be
prepared to be able to laugh at things.

125
00:09:53,48 --> 00:09:57,81
If you take life seriously nimbin
is not for you not like your people

126
00:09:57,81 --> 00:09:59,89
that they come and say oh
you've lived here it is.

127
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:02,04
Think i guess i got a
sense for him forget it.

128
00:10:04,31 --> 00:10:10,71
I know i know i really haven't i

129
00:10:10,71 --> 00:10:13,10
don't i haven't got a funny story

130
00:10:13,10 --> 00:10:16,99
and i think i've got really you
know i have to think about it but

131
00:10:16,99 --> 00:10:23,13
that be lots of funny things that happened
in my life that you could laugh about.

132
00:10:23,38 --> 00:10:30,04
I think the mind i think
there's probably well

133
00:10:30,05 --> 00:10:33,37
probably during the first of when i didn't
run down the street but no flies on

134
00:10:33,37 --> 00:10:36,23
and i have a bobbing along you know and
i far as you know after about that

135
00:10:36,23 --> 00:10:38,27
but nothing really.

136
00:10:47,88 --> 00:10:49,21
It's like the funny things. It's happened.

137
00:10:49,49 --> 00:10:53,10
I like anything in particular
that i could sort of say well yes

138
00:10:53,10 --> 00:10:59,83
that was probably when you've gone off my
heart you know telling that story but.

139
00:10:59,85 --> 00:11:19,86
You know you know i'm thank you.

140
00:11:21,45 --> 00:11:27,20
I'm sally sara and i was
very very busy jr..

141
00:11:28,53 --> 00:11:34,01
During the first festival i
mean i was nimble to go home

142
00:11:34,01 --> 00:11:40,81
and i had such a full
time job of making the

143
00:11:40,81 --> 00:11:46,94
streets presentable and
clean enough for everyone

144
00:11:46,94 --> 00:11:51,66
and the toilet job was a quite a handful

145
00:11:54,24 --> 00:12:00,28
and i have a bit of other.
Counsel judy. Yes to do.

146
00:12:01,94 --> 00:12:07,90
Beside that but mainly. My only
my full days were taken up with.

147
00:12:10,01 --> 00:12:15,92
Just looking after the street and particularly
the garbage there was so much of it.

148
00:12:20,10 --> 00:12:24,24
What do you. Like.

149
00:12:24,25 --> 00:12:27,74
People.

150
00:12:30,62 --> 00:12:36,83
My memories back of the first of all
i. On that's quite such a shame.

151
00:12:37,16 --> 00:12:42,12
Quite a few nice new people that came and.

152
00:12:42,14 --> 00:12:44,20
Quite a few of them are still here.

153
00:12:46,50 --> 00:12:51,02
And the way i feel.

154
00:12:52,44 --> 00:12:55,44
Most of those who want to leave
here and do the right thing there.

155
00:12:57,14 --> 00:13:02,45
They're not really happy with.
Having another festival so nice.

156
00:13:02,49 --> 00:13:07,45
Here i think they might feel.

157
00:13:07,58 --> 00:13:14,01
And that's quite a lot goes
on that shouldn't be going on

158
00:13:14,01 --> 00:13:27,68
and may not may not feel happy about it.

159
00:13:29,24 --> 00:13:29,83
Do you think so.

160
00:13:32,76 --> 00:13:38,54
My farewell to

161
00:13:41,76 --> 00:13:48,37
you for that. Well if i
know as much of a home now.

162
00:13:49,47 --> 00:13:55,07
I certainly would have been
very much other guys because.

163
00:13:57,28 --> 00:13:59,34
Oh so many things went on.

164
00:14:02,50 --> 00:14:09,51
Particularly the way people
walk from quite a distance.

165
00:14:09,53 --> 00:14:14,25
People quite a distance walking
from where they lived and camped.

166
00:14:14,64 --> 00:14:17,12
To shower rooms and

167
00:14:17,12 --> 00:14:22,94
that i mean it didn't matter who
you know what you were they had.

168
00:14:27,14 --> 00:14:29,10
They walk completely uncovered and.

169
00:14:33,13 --> 00:14:35,94
At least i feel i could have been a towel.

170
00:14:37,47 --> 00:14:43,04
And some of the other places that were.

171
00:14:44,56 --> 00:14:50,99
Some of the tents and things
that you got to walk past well.

172
00:14:51,01 --> 00:14:54,40
When mum and dad. Was.

173
00:14:55,32 --> 00:14:59,49
Leading the way of course
they they probably stopped

174
00:14:59,49 --> 00:15:06,07
and turned the children
back the other way.

175
00:15:09,75 --> 00:15:13,73
So they wouldn't see what
was going on. In the team.

176
00:15:13,79 --> 00:15:17,82
So yeah they changed their action.

177
00:15:19,78 --> 00:15:24,87
And. There was so much
happening that happened then.

178
00:15:27,92 --> 00:15:29,58
In the drug needling part where

179
00:15:36,61 --> 00:15:40,46
they were so many. So many use needles.

180
00:15:40,88 --> 00:15:45,46
Even lying about.

181
00:15:46,47 --> 00:15:51,37
And working they don't ever seems well.

182
00:15:53,24 --> 00:15:59,92
It was no it was no problem at
all for me the trying to claim.

183
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,86
In that clean the dump and
we cycle it and come across.

184
00:16:07,79 --> 00:16:11,73
I don't mind needles in one place without
any trouble and move on a bit further

185
00:16:11,73 --> 00:16:17,21
and come across more still
with a needle in them.

186
00:16:17,23 --> 00:16:20,88
So it would have been very risky to.

187
00:16:25,29 --> 00:16:28,20
To even put your hands or feet
anywhere near the needles

188
00:16:28,20 --> 00:16:36,26
or what you didn't know was already there.

189
00:16:39,02 --> 00:16:43,81
That was on the first of all
time but it's. It's been there.

190
00:16:45,78 --> 00:16:47,24
It has been the same until just recently

191
00:16:47,24 --> 00:16:54,08
when the dump us has changed
hands a bit for recycling

192
00:16:54,08 --> 00:16:56,97
people but.

193
00:17:00,52 --> 00:17:06,20
The need to have a very right
up until just recently and.

194
00:17:08,68 --> 00:17:15,35
As i go in our times for a better
recycling even at the showground well

195
00:17:17,07 --> 00:17:19,88
there's plenty of needles left
just anywhere at the showground

196
00:17:21,83 --> 00:17:25,10
and i'd be.

197
00:17:25,11 --> 00:17:31,84
I'd be very much against a
festival restarting like it was

198
00:17:31,84 --> 00:17:34,71
then. Because.

199
00:17:37,20 --> 00:17:39,45
It's risky even walking about now and.

200
00:17:40,91 --> 00:17:43,34
What will be like weather
with a bigger crowd

201
00:17:45,26 --> 00:17:53,13
and the drugs don't ever seem to.

202
00:17:53,15 --> 00:17:59,72
Don't seem to slacken off any
day and to be just as many.

203
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,30
Much now as it ever was.

204
00:18:06,55 --> 00:18:07,87
Was.

205
00:18:26,01 --> 00:18:29,12
I just don't know of
anything really that they.

206
00:18:31,21 --> 00:18:34,90
What real good the first of all did
you know name when it was so small

207
00:18:34,90 --> 00:18:38,33
and probably going back but.

208
00:18:40,46 --> 00:18:41,78
It has brought business and

209
00:18:41,78 --> 00:18:49,36
that into town.

210
00:18:50,30 --> 00:18:54,65
But when so many. Very rough

211
00:18:54,65 --> 00:19:01,36
and layabout people

212
00:19:01,36 --> 00:19:05,12
you've got a job even to walk in the
street because there are so many.

213
00:19:06,96 --> 00:19:08,67
They're sitting around your layout around

214
00:19:08,67 --> 00:19:15,45
and they don't even make
room for oldies who was

215
00:19:15,46 --> 00:19:18,46
clear particularly for
the australian rural

216
00:19:18,46 --> 00:19:23,60
or shopping shopping trolley.

217
00:19:23,62 --> 00:19:28,30
Or kiddie stroller and that there's
barely room to get past them.

218
00:19:32,34 --> 00:19:56,03
I can't i can't say it's done a really
lot of good a lot of good for no.

219
00:19:58,21 --> 00:19:59,56
I did find there was some.

220
00:20:01,44 --> 00:20:07,69
Some very good musicians
among the the new settlers

221
00:20:07,69 --> 00:20:12,00
and very very talented in music

222
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:20,88
and.

223
00:20:20,90 --> 00:20:25,14
Sometimes i quite often join them

224
00:20:25,14 --> 00:20:29,02
and i do a lot of singing.

225
00:20:31,46 --> 00:20:34,19
I still do it. It's 70 you know 79

226
00:20:35,49 --> 00:20:42,15
and sometime the all time it turn
people into like me they come along

227
00:20:42,15 --> 00:20:46,02
and sing while they do the backing

228
00:20:48,32 --> 00:21:11,26
and i i really enjoy it.

229
00:21:25,10 --> 00:21:27,10
I just can't think of any.

230
00:21:28,10 --> 00:21:34,93
Special time i had with them occasionally

231
00:21:34,93 --> 00:21:38,87
though not so long.

232
00:21:39,03 --> 00:21:43,73
Back occasionally they were
performed on the nimbin showground

233
00:21:43,73 --> 00:21:48,16
and i joined in with them

234
00:21:48,16 --> 00:21:54,79
and done quite a few items

235
00:21:54,79 --> 00:21:59,83
with there and holger.

236
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,74
No whole public in general
really enjoyed it. That's.

237
00:22:09,43 --> 00:22:12,66
A couple of. Special times
i can remember with them.

238
00:22:31,22 --> 00:22:37,98
Some of the songs that i there with
the people if they don't know them.

239
00:22:40,45 --> 00:22:41,45
If they don't know them themselves.

240
00:22:42,00 --> 00:22:47,38
Like i have music and they
can follow them that way.

241
00:22:49,22 --> 00:22:52,36
Some of them are quite up to date.

242
00:22:52,38 --> 00:22:57,21
Country and western songs
such as one day at a time

243
00:22:57,21 --> 00:23:01,37
and please help me i'm falling

244
00:23:01,37 --> 00:23:06,37
and the good old days here day and.

245
00:23:12,91 --> 00:23:14,19
Also pearly shells

246
00:23:14,19 --> 00:23:21,20
and i

247
00:23:21,21 --> 00:23:23,64
usually say you come with a name and lives

248
00:23:23,64 --> 00:23:28,79
and they tell them without
there's only one my wife

249
00:23:29,66 --> 00:23:32,44
and on very happy that.

250
00:23:34,86 --> 00:23:37,17
If i sound like him but
i'm not going to try

251
00:23:37,17 --> 00:23:41,53
and either last has really only one girl.

252
00:23:43,24 --> 00:23:44,24
Also i can do the.

253
00:23:46,80 --> 00:23:53,68
I have a good allies song for
the oldies all in general.

254
00:23:56,46 --> 00:24:01,36
Have been guys these go away by.
Produce that one sometimes.

255
00:24:10,59 --> 00:24:17,19
And if anyone wants gospel songs will
they come to the right place because i

256
00:24:19,72 --> 00:24:25,56
i can certainly certainly
handle the gospel and.

257
00:24:27,61 --> 00:24:32,20
I'm doing it regularly the moment
memory all the local churches

258
00:24:35,28 --> 00:24:40,88
went to sydney recently to groom
sounds were nearly the man i was

259
00:24:42,69 --> 00:24:45,24
saying especially one who
is wearing which i did

260
00:24:47,17 --> 00:24:52,82
and i just come back from a lovely
weekend then in tenterfield i

261
00:24:55,72 --> 00:25:00,25
sang in two two churches
a tenterfield plus.

262
00:25:05,45 --> 00:25:11,88
Three other three other out into
the senior citizens which gave me

263
00:25:15,61 --> 00:25:20,86
five things songs in three days so
i think about coming home from all

264
00:25:20,86 --> 00:25:33,51
that i.

265
00:25:34,88 --> 00:25:35,82
Time jobs.

266
00:25:37,60 --> 00:25:44,11
Yes.

267
00:25:45,26 --> 00:25:50,69
Yes i and i was in 1973 i was in. Oh.

268
00:25:50,71 --> 00:25:55,50
I'm don johnston and back in 1973
when equities vegetable was murdered.

269
00:25:55,56 --> 00:25:59,88
I was a dairy farmer here at
bishop's creek which is near nim.

270
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:01,87
When and i would also

271
00:26:01,87 --> 00:26:07,49
and a counsellor on the main issue i counsel
which i later become amalgamated with

272
00:26:07,49 --> 00:26:12,08
little more city council. We did
make a decision back in seventy two.

273
00:26:12,23 --> 00:26:17,88
Just before the chris festival to allow
the festival to be held in nimbin.

274
00:26:18,39 --> 00:26:20,30
And.

275
00:26:20,32 --> 00:26:24,95
That's about as far as i'm concerned
the situation would have possibly been

276
00:26:24,95 --> 00:26:28,61
that there were only three
or four did object to the.

277
00:26:29,22 --> 00:26:30,57
At the public meeting

278
00:26:30,57 --> 00:26:36,56
that they shouldn't have their queers
festival the rest of nimbin seem to be going

279
00:26:36,56 --> 00:26:37,21
along with it.

280
00:26:37,28 --> 00:26:43,03
So that's where the high council made the
decision to allow it to be held and.

281
00:26:43,98 --> 00:26:47,42
Looking back in those days i feel it
only one thing that we should have done

282
00:26:48,71 --> 00:26:53,14
and that was probably to
put a bigger bond on the.

283
00:26:53,16 --> 00:26:58,80
Festival committee because they clean our
program later left a lot to be desired

284
00:26:58,80 --> 00:27:06,49
and the mania shire council
had a pick up the tab for it.

285
00:27:07,48 --> 00:27:09,78
Yes i was around for all of the festival.

286
00:27:10,08 --> 00:27:12,48
I was also president of
the nimbin bowling club

287
00:27:13,48 --> 00:27:15,64
and the festival was right beside it

288
00:27:17,37 --> 00:27:23,59
and my wife was heavily committed to a
church organization by having meals like

289
00:27:23,59 --> 00:27:25,86
soups and and teas

290
00:27:25,86 --> 00:27:29,36
and running other for the people
who were visiting the festival

291
00:27:30,26 --> 00:27:34,40
and so i was committed every day
and every night at the club

292
00:27:34,40 --> 00:27:36,62
and help helping organizations

293
00:27:36,62 --> 00:27:40,04
and even taking in the some of
the visitors to their camps

294
00:27:40,04 --> 00:27:46,13
and wanting other during the night.

295
00:27:46,84 --> 00:27:50,82
It was different. It was
most certainly different.

296
00:27:50,84 --> 00:27:54,19
I feel that the young people
most of the young people

297
00:27:54,19 --> 00:27:59,49
that were there didn't really understand
what they were there for that was my.

298
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:01,68
First impression of a lot of the people

299
00:28:02,54 --> 00:28:05,93
but they certainly enjoyed themselves
for those 10 days that they were there

300
00:28:05,93 --> 00:28:12,71
and most certainly they were helped
by everyone in yemen to try to join

301
00:28:12,71 --> 00:28:19,38
in and be part of it.

302
00:28:20,47 --> 00:28:24,10
Oh some of the funny sites
were probably the first time

303
00:28:24,10 --> 00:28:27,51
that we've seen a lot of people
getting around with no clothes on.

304
00:28:29,38 --> 00:28:35,70
Even in fairly.

305
00:28:37,18 --> 00:28:43,47
Populated streets and one thing another. I
don't think too many talk a great deal.

306
00:28:43,54 --> 00:28:49,16
Another top it but i do believe that
some of the things and one of the things

307
00:28:49,16 --> 00:28:53,96
that have come from what i believe was
the presence of drugs and i do know

308
00:28:53,96 --> 00:28:58,29
that the local constabulary they
told them told the committee

309
00:28:58,29 --> 00:29:02,96
that they would not be hard on them if they
only used soft drugs such as marijuana

310
00:29:02,96 --> 00:29:06,10
but once they used hard drugs they
would clampdown on them which they did

311
00:29:06,91 --> 00:29:13,74
and i can remember one distinct episode
where a group of people could be number

312
00:29:13,74 --> 00:29:16,53
twelve or fifteen hundred got bolt cutters

313
00:29:16,53 --> 00:29:20,58
and cut the handcuffs off a prisoner

314
00:29:20,59 --> 00:29:25,85
that a detective had.

315
00:29:27,30 --> 00:29:31,97
Not really though very little of fighting
between themselves or with anyone else.

316
00:29:34,04 --> 00:29:36,95
It was a really good time with
lots of really good music

317
00:29:36,95 --> 00:29:39,83
and lots of good time for
most of the people concerned

318
00:29:39,83 --> 00:29:45,52
or there were the only those isolated
actions that i believe that did married

319
00:29:45,52 --> 00:29:53,60
but not to any great extent.

320
00:29:54,94 --> 00:29:55,93
Well the good thing they left.

321
00:29:56,01 --> 00:29:59,53
I believe there are some very talented
people in the area and they probably.

322
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,72
Them from their aquarius
festival or have got.

323
00:30:05,74 --> 00:30:10,74
Media coverage since a lot of
people with great talents and arts

324
00:30:10,74 --> 00:30:16,96
and crafts we have some very good craft
shops and workshops in the village now

325
00:30:16,96 --> 00:30:22,31
that can be put down as
from the aquarius festival.

326
00:30:23,22 --> 00:30:29,48
There's also probably a lot of money
being generated by people there whether

327
00:30:29,48 --> 00:30:32,81
or not it's because of dole or because
of invalid pensions or whatever

328
00:30:32,81 --> 00:30:36,95
but there is a lot more money
in newbern at the present stage

329
00:30:36,95 --> 00:30:43,67
and they were back in not before 1973.

330
00:30:44,52 --> 00:30:48,18
You know ne'eman a lot of people say
it was a becoming a ghost town.

331
00:30:48,58 --> 00:30:49,21
I don't believe

332
00:30:49,21 --> 00:30:53,96
that for one moment it was going through
what we'd call a probably a recession.

333
00:30:56,20 --> 00:31:02,83
It was just coming to the stage where
we had some about a total of about 100

334
00:31:03,69 --> 00:31:05,19
dairy farms in the area.

335
00:31:05,25 --> 00:31:06,59
We had around but a factory

336
00:31:07,61 --> 00:31:10,91
that all fell by the wayside it
was just trying to deteriorate.

337
00:31:11,66 --> 00:31:18,54
We had about four or five miles in the
area one mile in a time had 28 employees.

338
00:31:18,56 --> 00:31:23,04
And now we're back to one meal so yes
there has been a decline in industry

339
00:31:23,04 --> 00:31:27,09
and i think that's the big problem we've
got in nimbin at the present stage not

340
00:31:27,09 --> 00:31:29,02
enough in industry and it.
