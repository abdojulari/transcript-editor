1
00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:08,16
Half three and farrier homework, worked as our happiness by MAC on the bridge.

2
00:00:08,16 --> 00:00:16,99
Yes, that you tell us exactly how you employed under combined watcher which dollars the lifeless workmanship.

3
00:00:16,99 --> 00:00:25,18
This dawn on me cemented alive nineteenth of July 's nineteen twenty six,

4
00:00:25,18 --> 00:00:36,09
and no the first two years I was employed on a template floor baking tempers for the various members get as a bridge

5
00:00:36,74 --> 00:00:40,82
and after two years I was transferred out of the workshop.

6
00:00:40,82 --> 00:00:44,05
I went through marking off assembling

7
00:00:44,05 --> 00:00:53,44
and riveting film through various processes of PA manifest how they Curtis Curtis what do you workshops were like her

8
00:00:53,44 --> 00:01:00,13
exact to the presence of weapons went through the workshop. He has raw material came in from overseas.

9
00:01:00,13 --> 00:01:06,53
From England and the a lot of this sort of semi- repair had prepared

10
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:17,76
and was marked off guillotine door policies just to settling cutting her marked off with river drills

11
00:01:18,32 --> 00:01:32,75
and so the assembly line and providing. From there to intervene to have a shop and assembles further to the first page.

12
00:01:32,75 --> 00:01:39,23
What was your job in the first place with marking of whether it is the process about the captivating

13
00:01:39,23 --> 00:01:41,91
when making the templates polly Curtis

14
00:01:41,96 --> 00:01:50,49
and I were transferred elderly chopping users templates where there are many of the same set of Mike individually

15
00:01:50,49 --> 00:01:55,86
failures of templates and then they were a month off the templates.

16
00:01:55,86 --> 00:02:06,67
Yes, not all, but there are quite a number the cliff these

17
00:02:06,67 --> 00:02:13,73
or used successfully excessively throughout the year workshops,

18
00:02:13,73 --> 00:02:17,74
but also a little over Martin from the drawings themselves

19
00:02:18,08 --> 00:02:24,00
and as a quite out of the skill applied in reading the drawings and accurate marking off

20
00:02:24,97 --> 00:02:31,39
and do what was the year the accuracy that was required was at absolute accuracy what service it all in all,

21
00:02:31,39 --> 00:02:37,15
Rome was at special in a particular job well similar cases very special comment on how to be right,

22
00:02:37,15 --> 00:02:42,37
especially jointing parts and the year when I went out of sight.

23
00:02:42,37 --> 00:02:48,93
They are to be right not just near enough firm with you go along from the year.

24
00:02:48,93 --> 00:02:53,08
The marking out to show we say the that the assembly.

25
00:02:53,08 --> 00:03:01,94
The Baltic heartburn meticulous in the process of that exactly who alleged the minimalist sort out the various parson

26
00:03:02,34 --> 00:03:10,15
they were assembled and window checked and rechecked course they had the inspectors are,

27
00:03:10,15 --> 00:03:14,34
but it left a party going through checking on us. We were doing something.

28
00:03:14,34 --> 00:03:19,5
There is a minimum area for the states

29
00:03:19,5 --> 00:03:31,00
and factor is a design level of do remember how they hear aligned at each each member with that with the next bottle of

30
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:39,46
estimates of the use of automated by tapes have long steel tapes released tapes.

31
00:03:39,46 --> 00:03:44,61
They also around one hundred feet long and weighs to vary her.

32
00:03:44,61 --> 00:03:51,76
She do expanding contract with the weather and they used to be checked each week on the thing,

33
00:03:51,76 --> 00:03:58,14
and sometimes it up to the waterway construes them to bring to our is a right accuracy

34
00:03:58,62 --> 00:04:05,93
and her several the very strict upon tickertape is right to know you are not good enough.

35
00:04:05,93 --> 00:04:20,19
There is a heard said that there was no curved members of the bridge 's is correct well you were to come in the top

36
00:04:20,19 --> 00:04:25,86
arch their dislike killer to my SIG I should say

37
00:04:29,7 --> 00:04:39,54
and commit only what it was like in the year in heavy shopping are you doing riveting in their year twelve senior

38
00:04:42,18 --> 00:04:48,23
served the big job moderator submit these skills later claimed attack one hundred

39
00:04:48,23 --> 00:04:58,00
and company so am colliding them up on the system big wooden girders and blocks to line up in these

40
00:04:58,5 --> 00:05:06,74
and the quite an amount of shipping around them to position and they were bolted together.

41
00:05:06,74 --> 00:05:08,51
There and checked

42
00:05:08,51 --> 00:05:18,74
and rechecked before are set out on assembly about Lilly approach strands group we were actually limiting yourself well

43
00:05:18,74 --> 00:05:28,14
I did do some riveting there quite a bit near the end of my time commission quits all stages of the trade of was there.

44
00:05:28,14 --> 00:05:37,95
Could it was about to further work of a riveting gang yes well agenda working now is River holder up them as a river

46
00:05:46,41 --> 00:06:00,01
and health quota skilful operation and the rivet have to be a hot enough to hotseat and media cook and

47
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:06,92
or the Optus has a is correct as of the process started with the year the River copper.

48
00:06:06,92 --> 00:06:14,75
He had a princess have what sizes who worked out what size of events they had to be cooking at any given time the river

49
00:06:14,75 --> 00:06:25,24
generally he would emphasise a result handled a have bought their put in the other woman at the right torture raked out

50
00:06:25,32 --> 00:06:29,7
to catch early as there was to, catcher at kerosene tin,

51
00:06:29,7 --> 00:06:38,1
then throw to make some distance of ten fifteen hours a time that is privileged place it in the whole folder holder up

52
00:06:38,1 --> 00:06:42,75
to hold a collar of a real.

53
00:06:42,75 --> 00:06:49,79
He has lets them that this is a fair picture given the size of events with any bigger than anywhere else in all

54
00:06:49,79 --> 00:06:56,47
and up from the high milk from the half insist size up to its in court.

55
00:06:56,47 --> 00:07:00,95
I think that the given most of the jobs are to think emollient

56
00:07:00,95 --> 00:07:06,07
and caught a one's head of the size river by a machine relating bacteria

57
00:07:06,07 --> 00:07:13,82
or to what sort of machine was that hydronic river hydronic bidding screen.

58
00:07:13,82 --> 00:07:26,82
Markedly to describe one had operated yesterday as a hydronic river Sligo because she'll which would straddle together

59
00:07:27,41 --> 00:07:36,34
and the same process for the River compere cooker is the place for the whole family is to come down to clamp action

60
00:07:36,34 --> 00:07:45,7
hydronic camp action squeeze rivets tightly into their founder of the tightness of the of the river came from the

61
00:07:45,7 --> 00:07:53,65
contraction of the rivet on cooling the separate matter pristine with a hydraulic action squared right up till in a

62
00:07:53,65 --> 00:08:01,76
state put the penny clearance and the holes are taken up by the hot metal being squeezed right up or no movement.

63
00:08:01,76 --> 00:08:09,13
Whatever, and these in turn clatter on rechecked by relevant specialist: will a small hammer

64
00:08:09,48 --> 00:08:18,31
and cap each visit treated as any movement, and if so, have nearly one like that they were marked and cut out

65
00:08:18,31 --> 00:08:26,43
and replaced given a lot of rivets being replaced on the bridge at times it is a fault in the hydraulic system analyst

66
00:08:26,43 --> 00:08:34,29
team right up to be quite another cut out that would happen to remember how the year.

67
00:08:34,29 --> 00:08:43,43
The allotment is of steel work we shifted around the the workshop to remember that the size of the members GST is quite

68
00:08:43,43 --> 00:08:44,41
heavy members

69
00:08:44,51 --> 00:08:54,62
and iodine is twenty in charge are staged DLL joists Culbert following Alliance write-down of the various sizes media

70
00:08:54,62 --> 00:09:06,05
is there ever had the cranes transfer cranes from which they come out by both the law is an transfer granular workshops

71
00:09:06,79 --> 00:09:13,48
and in the light workshop, there were two bays mainly won't marking off.

72
00:09:13,98 --> 00:09:19,13
Assembling and riveting can I take it back to the time where you

73
00:09:19,13 --> 00:09:24,05
when you first got a job at the London can you remember how you got the job

74
00:09:24,06 --> 00:09:28,48
and can your member distiller 's story of are over.

75
00:09:28,48 --> 00:09:31,46
Apply for a job in getting up, I applied to the job there

76
00:09:31,87 --> 00:09:42,39
and are soon after never got left Avenue reveal your plans with is a a black door Molloy company at Dawes point because

77
00:09:42,39 --> 00:09:54,76
they are close to normal Playford apply to the job: company has turned apprentice, year workshops

78
00:09:57,59 --> 00:10:11,28
and in the hospital of the to the starting time of him wanted to its later tender when I started there has,

79
00:10:11,28 --> 00:10:16,63
so I have to do further workshops. What I would go through tender.

80
00:10:16,63 --> 00:10:26,5
I was told by the manager role London is an indispensable luck that said that this is a very important job is worth

81
00:10:26,5 --> 00:10:28,27
doing is worth doing well.

82
00:10:28,27 --> 00:10:37,65
I always remember that and there was Mister Henry Martin is a workshop manager,

83
00:10:37,65 --> 00:10:44,93
it is never much to do with after that they know that well. He was also around the workshops up-and-down E.

84
00:10:44,93 --> 00:10:45,22
Coli

85
00:10:45,22 --> 00:10:55,45
and workers are investors that are quite a bit to remember any any tragic incident signing you accidents such in the in

86
00:10:55,45 --> 00:11:04,62
the workshop jester was one where one day of the remember her tragic accident there one day

87
00:11:05,15 --> 00:11:19,72
and I just forget the gentleman 's name electrician tender Caleb Nicol Boyle and a much of that resentment over.

88
00:11:20,15 --> 00:11:24,93
District years ago, gambling fifty years at ten thousand one

89
00:11:25,54 --> 00:11:32,19
and nine hours several other minor to serious accidents just being hit by girders

90
00:11:32,19 --> 00:11:40,56
and her steelwork falling on the tender but out on the site where I was never very much at all.

91
00:11:40,56 --> 00:11:45,14
There are a few accents quite a few of their mental

92
00:11:45,14 --> 00:11:55,81
and chap Hurstville Pilate one-day was killed momentous time chapter name of Kelly fell off the arch into the harbour

93
00:11:55,81 --> 00:12:02,47
and survived her that was too that I remember very well put,

94
00:12:02,47 --> 00:12:10,85
or others as we may not about to remember her arm many amusing incidents around the around the workshops where he

95
00:12:10,85 --> 00:12:16,39
worked. Yes oh one.

96
00:12:16,39 --> 00:12:27,84
Outer never forget on a stomach ownership how age of seventeen she was limits per week for our first year

97
00:12:28,35 --> 00:12:37,19
and during the first years as a variation of the award and we got one penny a week rise which is all dictatorial,

98
00:12:37,19 --> 00:12:47,25
however, one twenty bought two cigarettes to which is a lot for apprentice there and the course next year.

99
00:12:47,25 --> 00:12:54,07
It went up about campus for the second year and surgery about one six.

100
00:12:54,07 --> 00:13:03,22
However, last year we were getting about the power of three pounds one assumes a week which included two

101
00:13:03,22 --> 00:13:12,61
and six is weak for passing our third year to technical exam so it died us what her second jetting exam graduate

102
00:13:12,61 --> 00:13:25,55
successfully extra you do remember the working conditions are in the workshops lawyer scroll that quite I suppose at

103
00:13:25,55 --> 00:13:30,23
the ties are normal though no were canteen.

104
00:13:30,23 --> 00:13:41,7
No were showers were dressing rooms just Baltic code up from somewhere were of you could no morning tea afternoon teas

105
00:13:41,7 --> 00:13:51,82
like part of a heart citizen Tbyte ability aged Einstein sat around workplace had a lunch

106
00:13:52,73 --> 00:14:05,53
and nerve launching up facility serve but he went to attempt what Japan's timber should have seen some time

107
00:14:05,53 --> 00:14:16,02
and depilatories what colour it was dim under the dust and if you do with your say I remember it,

108
00:14:16,02 --> 00:14:24,13
didn't remember the dust that is apparently had the floor will the floors of dirt# the floor

109
00:14:24,75 --> 00:14:36,96
and her very dusty at times and now that act watered down that down a bit and geriatric times

110
00:14:36,96 --> 00:14:44,77
and especially Peter went off the harbour that it was soon as workshops was bitterly cold and less dust fly.

111
00:14:44,77 --> 00:14:52,18
There is a very year in a dreadful times

112
00:14:52,25 --> 00:15:00,38
but her about the condition work without incident during a lunch as carefully as about forty two minutes

113
00:15:00,38 --> 00:15:13,63
or forty five minutes and no matters extended our lunch hours there and they are everybody having outside

114
00:15:13,63 --> 00:15:21,4
when the whistle went through the exodus over workplace Claire worked straight away from the Crown

115
00:15:21,4 --> 00:15:30,13
and can yes a lot of our lunchtime is still I work it out.

116
00:15:30,13 --> 00:15:38,38
I don economic rain Frenchman when owners are trenching of frontiers are called in

117
00:15:38,76 --> 00:15:41,52
and he is to run this crap in anger at lunchtime

118
00:15:42,22 --> 00:15:51,09
and know it around me in Australian law where all are now higher there than over the Crown and anchor

119
00:15:51,15 --> 00:15:54,49
and a bit put pending up through silly whatever,

120
00:15:54,49 --> 00:16:08,82
and now he ran a company for their call the years after the day there is a very excited chap Frenchy Hamburger Hill.

121
00:16:08,82 --> 00:16:15,95
I say he has Donovan on the crane happens to some mishap happened are something I'd injured

122
00:16:16,11 --> 00:16:25,56
and he was very upset is upset that equipment is crowning of us find that the at least one thing I remember about her

123
00:16:26,27 --> 00:16:36,18
and that this is another chap there was an SP bookmaker is to take bets on the side of thought by with a bit of paper

124
00:16:36,18 --> 00:16:36,81
just leave it.

125
00:16:36,81 --> 00:16:48,74
I'm reworked them head look at the cefaclor was around going to the paper and no, it was as though her Bentley, Harrow,

126
00:16:48,74 --> 00:16:58,84
his name was and the heat is lost sight of a boilermaker Leanne is to take the bets and in those days as an island,

127
00:16:58,84 --> 00:17:05,66
have transistor radios and get the result race results disembowelled only days

128
00:17:05,81 --> 00:17:13,22
and sometimes a racist title eleven o'clock in the morning and people putting their bets on their shilling each way

129
00:17:13,22 --> 00:17:18,00
or sixty feet by whatever I petitions with the new Vic bit

130
00:17:18,45 --> 00:17:29,18
and to get the results just about a barbershop how North Wilson 's point and there Jimmy barber shops

131
00:17:29,18 --> 00:17:32,31
and hotels of a source getting information from raises

132
00:17:33,05 --> 00:17:42,63
and this barbershop tippee result somehow am to get the message through a little window through a hole in the size were

133
00:17:42,63 --> 00:17:50,4
shot dead as shoving Linux trains as a whole cut in their permission to come through there with the result of the race

134
00:17:50,4 --> 00:17:52,42
was at another time.

135
00:17:52,42 --> 00:17:57,1
I remember another time when the train to come in a business point

136
00:17:57,39 --> 00:18:05,2
and it up online at a shunt to try entitled to the message on the race and it was another source of information

137
00:18:06,1 --> 00:18:10,39
and ideas of clever enough things

138
00:18:10,39 --> 00:18:22,23
and were shocked they went on to company article eleven OES that we can appear lunchtime different times

139
00:18:23,46 --> 00:18:26,42
and I remember one time are very well.

140
00:18:26,42 --> 00:18:37,29
Her two levels with up the laptop and just before the last part of the joint and there were a few place across.

141
00:18:37,29 --> 00:18:47,27
We crossed and no which we should not have done, we came back in the summary: this who went back in the form

142
00:18:47,27 --> 00:18:52,12
and character dressing down and there have one chapter,

143
00:18:52,12 --> 00:19:03,06
yet this chap Charlie none is dead now held for Mister Al Smart is inkling investment

144
00:19:03,72 --> 00:19:13,16
and details address in Downey said long I loved that put the company. If you fallen chart is all costs.

145
00:19:13,16 --> 00:19:21,51
Loss of others to develop that the latest will you would do it again.

146
00:19:21,51 --> 00:19:28,04
So, because I think some dollar to go up there and no, I have a good photograph that once,

147
00:19:28,04 --> 00:19:34,44
subject to a focused step of Austen hired crawl up on top of the creeper crane or halfway up

148
00:19:34,58 --> 00:19:44,92
and out a photograph taken of eighteen downwards which was the interest shown around the workshop ten in our section in

149
00:19:44,92 --> 00:19:47,29
the form got to hear of it

150
00:19:47,29 --> 00:19:54,37
and gave me a dressing down about ten years at world as we counter these things that they were things that happen.

151
00:19:54,37 --> 00:19:59,38
They honeys oppose only when the younger do it, but looking at these

152
00:20:00,01 --> 00:20:12,07
or early Whitehead lecture Billy Whitehead do I ever feels and I'm work of their peers a strong man in his own right

153
00:20:12,57 --> 00:20:24,52
and elderly strongman acts and here to give birth at lunchtime there particular, namely a dead cat, however,

154
00:20:24,52 --> 00:20:25,62
have the ropes

155
00:20:25,62 --> 00:20:37,02
and shake for the Cardinal 's car boys takes on head laydown on a board with all males protruding through it.

156
00:20:37,02 --> 00:20:46,86
I am that ministers can take his shirt off and that the rock on his chest chats with a sledgehammer

157
00:20:46,86 --> 00:20:57,25
and breakers brought and it is the rock breaker sieges thought and it painted sees the idea

158
00:20:57,25 --> 00:21:01,21
and I only write take the weight off with your elbows on the ground

159
00:21:01,87 --> 00:21:09,38
and this too heartened Lilly came at this board is to do is back and blood coming out thing went wrong.

160
00:21:09,38 --> 00:21:12,04
but However, that was it,

161
00:21:12,04 --> 00:21:22,58
and another VRML about a one-day visit either a close the arts of the bridge twelve day by day.

162
00:21:22,58 --> 00:21:33,00
There is a report on the papers to bridges headache OCR ticketing closer tender supposedly close on the temperature of

163
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:44,29
right and no birthday about eleven midday called if someone were to the arch can closed

164
00:21:44,93 --> 00:21:48,71
when the singles given the siren in the workshop.

165
00:21:48,71 --> 00:21:52,05
when Kyle could do to inciting out like that

166
00:21:52,24 --> 00:22:00,01
and then all the ferries in the harbour which imagine a lot in those days all Easter as a cockatiel doing in this rush

167
00:22:00,01 --> 00:22:06,49
the shop and outside how, author and harbourfront facility and everybody is looking at.

168
00:22:06,49 --> 00:22:09,41
Could you couldn't see that this difference:

169
00:22:09,41 --> 00:22:20,53
back in his ability waited there standard in ours folders justly back listed to new@ CBOE on a set of missing archfoes

170
00:22:20,53 --> 00:22:27,99
before and that you are not enabled Karl is our results are to take office.

171
00:22:27,99 --> 00:22:39,14
I was a Russian but it is all genome is swiftly below the critical of over the year to get that our quota identity.

172
00:22:39,14 --> 00:22:51,45
There did you get to any memento from the with Amy arch was closed yesterday gave everybody Canberra for each tender.

173
00:22:51,45 --> 00:22:56,98
I mislaid my somewhere but that could be around a lot of photographs, I hand

174
00:22:57,5 --> 00:23:08,02
and that few mementos which I just can't claim a hands-on got a nice e-mail moved that Mabel over plaster thrown out by

175
00:23:08,02 --> 00:23:12,66
a panel of full-time, but I cannot find them.

176
00:23:12,66 --> 00:23:15,9
Do you remember will be there

177
00:23:15,9 --> 00:23:28,22
and union meetings at the at the workshops GS fatality union meeting regularly cutting were nearly popped up a shop

178
00:23:28,22 --> 00:23:35,31
committee. They are and was sort of a militant shop committee on the ball all the time.

179
00:23:35,31 --> 00:23:38,85
Although the work that many strikes in the workshop.

180
00:23:38,85 --> 00:23:44,96
So a few outside on site which is understandable mean is very dangerous.

181
00:23:44,96 --> 00:23:46,01
A lot of that work

182
00:23:47,01 --> 00:23:55,71
and they fought for height money in danger money which disposes only proper in those days because I took a lot of risks

183
00:23:55,71 --> 00:24:11,21
to be no way these eight would be done the veneer terminal shop committee have a chat DNA was Arthur Reardon to the

184
00:24:11,21 --> 00:24:22,08
fact that there could speak and feels the chairman and are when there was a meeting on figuring it out.

185
00:24:22,08 --> 00:24:29,14
Alert you already are already everybody fosters emitting fair and equitable to be said that

186
00:24:29,18 --> 00:24:32,42
but I do remember to three strikes are

187
00:24:32,42 --> 00:24:41,47
but that didn't last for a long I remember at one time they authorise traders Ltd boilermakers.

188
00:24:41,72 --> 00:24:59,16
Lucas on account of the heavy nature of the work which it was heavy power alone manhandling do should have a Leo Abare

189
00:24:59,49 --> 00:25:08,66
whether for any true for men or whatever and turn these bars over and if you didn't cannabis

190
00:25:08,66 --> 00:25:15,69
when you'll adhere to her break around the throne and around to seriously hurt.

191
00:25:15,69 --> 00:25:25,72
I remember there one day returning a row. Her role steel joist about twenty time and no court again.

192
00:25:26,08 --> 00:25:29,44
Lucas total Centre know what to do that.

193
00:25:29,44 --> 00:25:35,9
I have a bit of experience and looked, and when you had up on the balanced to let go conducted odds

194
00:25:36,36 --> 00:25:46,85
and if you didn't and how moderate and throw you remember very well returning one girl earlier one day someone

195
00:25:47,7 --> 00:25:56,85
when they turn up under the ballast salary allowed to write about your serve leavers who wants it didn't,

196
00:25:56,85 --> 00:26:06,3
and a thrilling and L the likely he missed going around in throwing strap on his feet at home

197
00:26:06,3 --> 00:26:17,98
and get that it was very late yesterday for the chap do remember any other instance around workshops

198
00:26:17,98 --> 00:26:21,4
or age would prefer to to other conditions.

199
00:26:21,4 --> 00:26:27,52
The workshops on just can't bring to mind any other incident

200
00:26:27,99 --> 00:26:34,97
but those days are workers as I said before a very heavy

201
00:26:35,13 --> 00:26:42,73
and I think these days I with improved technology work would be very much easier,

202
00:26:42,73 --> 00:26:51,84
as in the workshops there have been just these overhead cranes and for transporting the heavy material

203
00:26:52,45 --> 00:27:03,88
and these days that have a lot of chips with electric lists have a lot of these are forklift trucks running around for

204
00:27:03,88 --> 00:27:11,95
an easy presentation materials from place to place with a it ever so much easier than the one aspect that I should

205
00:27:11,95 --> 00:27:18,6
think that protective worker, it easier to remember going to work are you a wed to and from work

206
00:27:18,6 --> 00:27:31,38
or lawyers are in those days they were three ships in the workshops are I was on the seven o'clock pool about four

207
00:27:31,69 --> 00:27:38,39
weeks to forty four hour week as a peer to catch tram six o'clock in the morning

208
00:27:38,82 --> 00:27:47,26
and if there was a reduction of special chair like before six o'clock in the morning Della McKay to the ferry across to

209
00:27:47,26 --> 00:27:52,72
Wilson 's point and I remember well to be a late different times, they were the fog, harbour

210
00:27:53,75 --> 00:28:00,01
and no then we go to technical College three nights a week

211
00:28:00,19 --> 00:28:07,09
or for seven o'clock call nine then there was no tiny back to where we lived

212
00:28:07,41 --> 00:28:15,58
and capital to take out not so would walk up from the Courier particular College in Alamo putting the three nights a

213
00:28:15,58 --> 00:28:23,46
week there some malign o'clock in the front we did,

214
00:28:23,46 --> 00:28:33,74
did you were cover part of the day off a week confirmed the get attacked or no no no no time off at all.

215
00:28:33,74 --> 00:28:44,13
So no holidays those days either remember hopping apprentices, paid for a Christmas Day Boxing Day New Year's Day

216
00:28:44,47 --> 00:28:50,01
and offered was no holiday little. She just worked right up Christmas Eve.

217
00:28:51,12 --> 00:29:04,61
New Year's Eve whatever Z can back to work to eliminate later that a holiday is limit sick back for sick pay customer

218
00:29:04,61 --> 00:29:10,65
that laughing at present I have got it, but as compensation.

219
00:29:10,65 --> 00:29:17,18
I don't remember of any first aid station boxes around in the factory in their workshops

220
00:29:18,15 --> 00:29:25,86
and I remember well a couple times I got a steel splinter and no,

221
00:29:25,86 --> 00:29:33,86
you contributed to what the call they Hospital Saturday fund, I think they called it about six p a week

222
00:29:34,69 --> 00:29:40,42
and you went to a hospital at the outpatient department are few work at night time

223
00:29:41,15 --> 00:29:47,09
and I remember very well go to work on hospital there is piece of steel out of hand

224
00:29:47,77 --> 00:30:00,01
and awaited their bout three to four hours and a young doctor there I think is a student here said I'll help

225
00:30:02,39 --> 00:30:12,67
or arm around in teachers are down there are forces just plunged into this tripe without stasis Dale Herbert profusely

226
00:30:12,67 --> 00:30:15,16
and where it only needed to have a band aid.

227
00:30:15,16 --> 00:30:21,04
These days the band is a top-down at like a boxing… and a one home

228
00:30:21,04 --> 00:30:28,98
and my mother said good heavens was wrong so shown that the outlook and just go Ireland bathed

229
00:30:28,98 --> 00:30:31,68
and it was a twenty to work next day,

230
00:30:31,68 --> 00:30:40,8
but to this day that Peter Steele still limiting hand there wary Mister at another time I had a go back airport some

231
00:30:40,8 --> 00:30:45,4
little articles cut a cut about.

232
00:30:45,85 --> 00:30:55,37
If it's metre stitch went along thereby that sticking plaster around what was it went back to it. Things like that.

233
00:30:55,37 --> 00:31:02,47
I mean no very primitive as far as first a night.

234
00:31:02,47 --> 00:31:06,24
Can you remember when you were laid off there when was its

235
00:31:06,24 --> 00:31:12,62
and written in no terms of the positioning of the bridge where was the bridge

236
00:31:12,62 --> 00:31:20,18
when you got letter high finished on the July nineteen thirty one and it was near completion

237
00:31:20,18 --> 00:31:26,41
and I mean they were playing off hands every Friday of each week ten of the laid off

238
00:31:26,41 --> 00:31:28,98
and cost return the March nineteen thirty two,

239
00:31:28,98 --> 00:31:37,19
so the main structure was built for thinking of the roadways train lines and the likes

240
00:31:37,73 --> 00:31:47,03
and NAB cylinder noise notice Saturday 's ten and with recourse an hour before remember very well the year four,

244
00:32:12,62 --> 00:32:21,17
no work in the depression as a nineteen thirty one thousand upon thousands artwork vinegar around on a bicycle round

245
00:32:21,17 --> 00:32:35,25
various workshops in the city suburbs of work, but it just hopeless somewhat if you do well in March,

246
00:32:35,25 --> 00:32:43,39
one week before the bridge is open, I set out a bicycle or a brother and we row these bicycles up to Queensland

247
00:32:43,89 --> 00:32:48,15
and was a great experience along the road agree.

248
00:32:48,15 --> 00:32:53,36
I remember well the first day is of very hot day and we pedal

249
00:32:53,75 --> 00:33:02,65
and arrive at why on the first night is about sixty miles on the road those days over the Hawkesbury Mountains.

250
00:33:02,65 --> 00:33:06,36
We walked past wiping pushing these bikes up. We had a very big labour.

251
00:33:06,36 --> 00:33:10,49
This tent blankets constant, and delete whatever

252
00:33:10,63 --> 00:33:19,92
and that could teleport River no Brits there is a year ferries traffic punts were on their

254
00:33:29,89 --> 00:33:31,48
across.

255
00:33:31,48 --> 00:33:34,5
However, we got along the road

256
00:33:34,5 --> 00:33:43,78
and made up to while the costs of this track as critic under storm K shoulder left in the local park under a band

259
00:34:02,7 --> 00:34:06,05

and their were carrying references for this problem well-known people in the suburb. We would lift the Saturdays.

265
00:34:53,00 --> 00:35:03,23
That is okay so… that there were proceeded on signed up the coast blue various places
