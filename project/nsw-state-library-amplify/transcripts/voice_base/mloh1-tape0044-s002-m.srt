So what did you do it at the right time
of the reeds do you clear up afterwards

78
00:07:33,32 --> 00:07:38,06

00:07:39,78 --> 00:07:45,02
a lieutenant say i was in the drive and
traction. I didn't know where obama next

80
00:07:45,02 --> 00:07:51,14

where we're gonna be but they made you

81
00:07:51,14 --> 00:07:57,72
mean one whale what nine grams
couldn't. But the golden and

82
00:07:58,42 --> 00:08:04,87

85
00:08:13,40 --> 00:08:18,67
a to deal start of born bloody
line. I did to my fam some sort of

86
00:08:18,67 --> 00:08:24,39
a tree. It wasn't drink you buggered. They
were down there but i got got over an

00:08:47,93 --> 00:08:53,96
a crook on my good follows true. I don't.

92
00:08:56,94 --> 00:08:58,02
So we had you get the names as

93
00:08:58,02 --> 00:09:04,59
a for us. My lieutenant
lindstrom able to next

94
00:09:04,59 --> 00:09:11,41
schoolteacher and he'd be in charge of
the unit. Some days remain as if anyone

95
00:09:11,41 --> 00:09:15,59

army. You always got out

96
00:09:16,38 --> 00:09:21,06
a day or no way they were in front
line or the back line. What they call

97
00:09:21,06 --> 00:09:22,100

100
00:09:37,99 --> 00:09:42,60
leinster when he'd be in charge of the
unit and these day all he'd give me

101
00:09:42,60 --> 00:09:44,32
a day wolf with him. So you could have

102
00:09:44,32 --> 00:09:49,74
a mate and friend. And i wouldn't
take. I wouldn't take another as

103
00:09:49,74 --> 00:09:55,07
a job at all and i was offered the

104
00:09:58,68 --> 00:10:03,13

00:10:26,67 --> 00:10:33,56

111
00:10:33,57 --> 00:10:39,07
was it was still a melon. In

112
00:10:39,08 --> 00:10:44,43
