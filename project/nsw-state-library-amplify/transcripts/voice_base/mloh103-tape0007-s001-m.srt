1
00:00:14,80 --> 00:00:18,19
So god. Wins.

2
00:00:19,18 --> 00:00:24,01
And i do more with jackson. So why.

3
00:00:24,90 --> 00:00:29,25
Double l i e. Jackson normal.

4
00:00:29,26 --> 00:00:33,56
Like ok i came to australia.

5
00:00:33,58 --> 00:00:35,19
Oh i'm julie jackson

6
00:00:35,19 --> 00:00:42,28
and i came to australia in 1973
after the equerries festival.

7
00:00:42,30 --> 00:00:49,21
I heard about aquarius. When i was
living in the himalayas in katmandu.

8
00:00:49,23 --> 00:00:50,60
Writing long

9
00:00:50,60 --> 00:00:54,51
and passionate letters to my sweetheart
who was in australia at the time.

10
00:00:56,09 --> 00:00:57,91
We had met in hong kong

11
00:00:58,70 --> 00:01:04,20
and i was taking a very long time
to return to western civilization.

12
00:01:05,30 --> 00:01:07,33
I spent a year in kathmandu.

13
00:01:08,20 --> 00:01:08,56
Went to england

14
00:01:09,57 --> 00:01:13,00
and whilst i was i was an england he
sent me to get to come to australia.

15
00:01:13,26 --> 00:01:14,05
So it was.

16
00:01:16,20 --> 00:01:20,57
An offer i wasn't unable to refuse.

17
00:01:21,54 --> 00:01:23,21
I arrived in australia in august

18
00:01:23,90 --> 00:01:27,95
and came up to nimbin about 10 days later

19
00:01:29,93 --> 00:01:34,51
and my arrival in australia been.

20
00:01:35,84 --> 00:01:40,95
A little disappointing. The love
story wasn't quite the love story.

21
00:01:41,19 --> 00:01:43,33
I thought it was and.

22
00:01:45,12 --> 00:01:51,89
It was very obvious that we weren't
going to live happily ever after. So.

23
00:01:51,91 --> 00:01:53,13
When i was coming.

24
00:01:53,45 --> 00:01:58,97
We were coming through from poland get out
having met my possible future in-laws.

25
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,97
I came down to nimbin. And
it was on the road to u.k.

26
00:02:04,97 --> 00:02:11,30
that I was struck by this
overwhelming knowing

27
00:02:11,30 --> 00:02:16,59
that this is where i was supposed to be
living this is where i supposed to be.

28
00:02:16,60 --> 00:02:22,45
The idea of nimbin and and. Aquarius
was already very appealing to me.

29
00:02:23,89 --> 00:02:30,71
I had quit my job in hong kong as a
very jet set a fashion designer living.

30
00:02:31,74 --> 00:02:37,19
Fully. And fast around the world.

31
00:02:37,21 --> 00:02:41,35
And i felt that i needed
to make more my life

32
00:02:41,35 --> 00:02:44,56
and having seen what was
happening in the world.

33
00:02:45,94 --> 00:02:51,23
And i believe there was another way
of doing things the commercialism

34
00:02:52,36 --> 00:02:58,92
and selfishness that i experienced. In
its own head in a stick way wasn't.

35
00:02:59,06 --> 00:03:03,40
What i wanted to do so.

36
00:03:04,18 --> 00:03:06,81
Nor was living in sydney and
being a playwrights write life.

37
00:03:07,09 --> 00:03:10,37
What i wanted to do either so.

38
00:03:11,43 --> 00:03:15,42
There was this knowledge that that i had
that nimbin was well i really should be

39
00:03:15,42 --> 00:03:21,42
but i had no idea how or what was going
to happen i went back to sydney and.

40
00:03:22,85 --> 00:03:27,72
Somehow i met the right people

41
00:03:28,85 --> 00:03:32,76
and i ended up coming up
to nimbin for the first.

42
00:03:34,04 --> 00:03:39,50
Countable tribal meeting which would
have been about september i think.

43
00:03:39,52 --> 00:03:44,89
With a very beautiful man called poet called
will tetley who i don't know where he

44
00:03:44,89 --> 00:03:49,92
is in the world now and i got the train.

45
00:03:50,49 --> 00:03:52,11
And was hitching from.

46
00:03:53,44 --> 00:03:54,22
Lismore to nimbin

47
00:03:54,22 --> 00:03:59,56
and was picked up by caroline norman who
were to go on to be very important in my

48
00:03:59,56 --> 00:04:01,02
life. When my children's lives.

49
00:04:02,13 --> 00:04:05,53
Carol was the midwife who
set up birth and beyond

50
00:04:05,53 --> 00:04:10,58
and norman her partner
was a great healer and.

51
00:04:10,60 --> 00:04:17,49
There i was in nimbin. And with
nowhere to go nowhere to stay.

52
00:04:17,67 --> 00:04:22,03
I didn't know anybody at that
will who had his own things to do

53
00:04:23,07 --> 00:04:27,81
and an intention to go to the first time
double trouble meeting i had a job by the

54
00:04:27,81 --> 00:04:33,98
way and to repay my rose to us.
We've had back for my ticket.

55
00:04:35,72 --> 00:04:38,05
To australia and.

56
00:04:40,44 --> 00:04:45,70
I never been in those days
was very small was very warm

57
00:04:45,71 --> 00:04:48,72
and very friendly and.

58
00:04:48,74 --> 00:04:54,39
Anybody new in town was immediately
noticeable and immediately people would come

59
00:04:54,39 --> 00:04:58,04
and welcome you and talk to them
and so on and it so happened

60
00:04:58,04 --> 00:05:03,89
that this beautiful blue
eyed dark eyelash young man

61
00:05:05,15 --> 00:05:06,24
sat down beside me inside.

62
00:05:06,26 --> 00:05:09,04
Started talking to me and
introduced himself as mark

63
00:05:10,23 --> 00:05:13,57
and i said do you know where i can stay

64
00:05:13,57 --> 00:05:17,63
and he said oh well we've got a bails you
could come and stand the bells. At all.

65
00:05:17,67 --> 00:05:23,82
Toby so. I'll toby's from. Lord of
the rings i think or something.

66
00:05:24,85 --> 00:05:27,41
And all these wonderful
names of places that were

67
00:05:27,41 --> 00:05:29,99
that were developed in those days

68
00:05:31,57 --> 00:05:35,51
and as true romance would have it.

69
00:05:36,59 --> 00:05:41,64
Mark who i renamed marcus
and i fell in love and.

70
00:05:41,66 --> 00:05:48,49
Had three babies and got married
at some stage and. Then.

71
00:05:48,51 --> 00:05:53,68
Parted at some stage and remained
very good friends over the years.

72
00:05:54,46 --> 00:05:59,91
About babies and the like
is it and second it's a.

73
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,57
Very green and rich and for
kundera it's mel's fertile.

74
00:06:06,59 --> 00:06:11,84
Things grow overnight you can
sit and watch things grow.

75
00:06:11,86 --> 00:06:19,59
And the feeling in in the 70s certainly
within my generation was i guess we were.

76
00:06:19,61 --> 00:06:21,80
Obviously young and of childbearing age

77
00:06:21,80 --> 00:06:27,86
and there was a great hope
great optimism for the future

78
00:06:27,86 --> 00:06:29,31
that we wanted to make things different.

79
00:06:30,43 --> 00:06:35,58
And part of making things different is
creating the generation to to carry

80
00:06:35,58 --> 00:06:42,03
that on and. A desire
to do it differently.

81
00:06:42,04 --> 00:06:46,45
Many many of us had had
experience childhoods

82
00:06:46,46 --> 00:06:48,70
that were maybe not as helpful as could be

83
00:06:48,70 --> 00:06:54,04
that were were pressured by materialism
which we all benefited from.

84
00:06:54,06 --> 00:06:54,60
But there was that

85
00:06:54,60 --> 00:06:58,36
that pendulum looking back now with
the wisdom of age you know there was

86
00:06:58,36 --> 00:07:01,49
that pendulum of wanting to reject all of

87
00:07:01,49 --> 00:07:07,04
that materialism which we saw was leading
us down a fairly devastating path as we

88
00:07:07,04 --> 00:07:11,51
experiencing now. So.

89
00:07:12,26 --> 00:07:17,61
Yeah to to to make families to
create and create a new society

90
00:07:17,61 --> 00:07:23,96
and part of creating a new society
is creating new life and.

91
00:07:23,97 --> 00:07:27,46
So and it's such a joyful process.

92
00:07:27,77 --> 00:07:33,65
I mean for me having babies was
one of the most amazing joyful

93
00:07:33,65 --> 00:07:40,28
experiences that ever ever had in my
life so i you know i love having babies.

94
00:07:40,65 --> 00:07:45,80
I love being pregnant. And.

95
00:07:45,82 --> 00:07:48,49
And and i love the nurturing.

96
00:07:49,04 --> 00:07:53,67
You know it's it was.

97
00:07:54,55 --> 00:07:58,06
It was something that that had
always been part of my nature

98
00:07:58,06 --> 00:08:01,70
but it really came into its
full and. No babies and and.

99
00:08:03,10 --> 00:08:08,49
Expressed itself in me looking
after everybody else's babies too.

100
00:08:09,08 --> 00:08:13,09
And i became a wet nurse

101
00:08:14,30 --> 00:08:21,00
and was an official wet
nurse and. I had three.

102
00:08:21,01 --> 00:08:27,89
Three babies long term for four for periods
of time one for three months i think

103
00:08:28,58 --> 00:08:34,72
i fed ruby. And my son.
I moved into the house.

104
00:08:35,57 --> 00:08:41,63
With ruby parents and and nurse
to us. A mother was ill and.

105
00:08:41,65 --> 00:08:47,85
And to what my own children with me
i had three by then and. All told.

106
00:08:50,03 --> 00:08:52,20
That the rough tally is around 200 babies.

107
00:08:52,68 --> 00:08:58,36
That i breastfed over the years
and it was it was natural.

108
00:08:58,77 --> 00:09:02,57
It was a natural thing to do the tween the
mothers who we were very close friends

109
00:09:02,57 --> 00:09:07,88
and we if there was for me if there
was a baby that was crying or a mama

110
00:09:07,88 --> 00:09:14,56
that was tired. It was so easy and very
simple for me to just nurse the baby.

111
00:09:15,25 --> 00:09:20,65
And maybe take take that take it a baby
for a night to get their mother rest.

112
00:09:21,30 --> 00:09:24,79
People did the same thing for me
to it wasn't a one way street

113
00:09:26,51 --> 00:09:31,76
and it was part of the tribal feeling
that we experienced in those days

114
00:09:32,83 --> 00:09:35,54
and so now.

115
00:09:35,56 --> 00:09:40,13
Sort of 17 18 years later i'm meeting.

116
00:09:41,62 --> 00:09:47,80
Many of my mighty babies as as
as as i think of them. You know.

117
00:09:47,82 --> 00:09:54,38
At dances and clubs and parties and
and seeing them growing up and even.

118
00:09:54,99 --> 00:09:59,73
I'm sort of a titty granny now.
One of one of the children.

119
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:02,02
What i looked after recently had a baby

120
00:10:02,02 --> 00:10:04,57
and i don't know how many are they've
all scattered to the four winds

121
00:10:04,57 --> 00:10:08,55
and in many cases but a lot of them are
still around and that their precious

122
00:10:08,55 --> 00:10:09,93
and beautiful young people

123
00:10:09,93 --> 00:10:16,24
and i have very good connections with many
of them still is coming together mothers

124
00:10:16,24 --> 00:10:21,67
and raising that.

125
00:10:22,69 --> 00:10:27,01
It was one that was one aspect of it.
Yes the desire to do it differently.

126
00:10:27,18 --> 00:10:34,14
The desire for different experiences
the the the the longing to move away

127
00:10:34,14 --> 00:10:39,83
from the the mechanical and
impersonal and come to know

128
00:10:39,83 --> 00:10:45,60
that giving birth is a natural thing it's
not not not an illness it didn't need to

129
00:10:45,60 --> 00:10:50,46
be hospitalized. I guess it was it
was a step further step beyond.

130
00:10:51,39 --> 00:10:56,10
The the the lib oil method that was
already very popular in europe

131
00:10:56,10 --> 00:10:59,31
and i think probably in australia.

132
00:11:00,24 --> 00:11:05,73
In england the home birth was was a fairly
normal sort of thing to have my sisters

133
00:11:05,73 --> 00:11:08,53
were both born at home and i was
presence for those births and

134
00:11:08,53 --> 00:11:12,85
that with their then and
then their thirties.

135
00:11:13,57 --> 00:11:19,10
So you know that that. You had that.

136
00:11:19,32 --> 00:11:23,98
That was one aspect of the hunger and the
closeness and support support network

137
00:11:23,99 --> 00:11:25,36
that was built up between the women.

138
00:11:25,89 --> 00:11:29,47
Was very important not only was

139
00:11:29,47 --> 00:11:32,25
that the sort of the actually
having a baby at home important but

140
00:11:32,25 --> 00:11:38,78
but the support afterwards which which
varied and some cases it was full on and

141
00:11:38,78 --> 00:11:39,46
and wonderful and

142
00:11:39,46 --> 00:11:42,90
and there's in all of those things
sometimes it missed the mark

143
00:11:42,90 --> 00:11:47,90
and it wasn't perhaps as good as it
could have been and that we you know.

144
00:11:48,38 --> 00:11:53,00
We did beautiful things and it was you
know again those bonds that were set up

145
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:54,99
and nosed those days
are still very strong.

146
00:11:57,17 --> 00:11:59,79
And as the children grew up
and as we grew up as women.

147
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,79
You know as we grew up and changed and.

148
00:12:04,56 --> 00:12:07,58
Experiences changed our needs changed.

149
00:12:08,30 --> 00:12:14,12
You know we developed in two to two
women who wanted. Something else and.

150
00:12:14,69 --> 00:12:16,90
Needed to grow and.

151
00:12:19,04 --> 00:12:25,70
The we had the women's group
which was a very strong

152
00:12:25,71 --> 00:12:31,07
and dynamic and exciting
time for a lot of us

153
00:12:31,07 --> 00:12:36,29
and was a shift in many many
years of women's lives where.

154
00:12:36,31 --> 00:12:40,45
I'm trying to remember
i'm dreadful on dates.

155
00:12:41,99 --> 00:12:46,78
It would have been. Late 70s.

156
00:12:47,80 --> 00:12:54,06
It would have been someone in the
late in the 70s. It was like.

157
00:12:55,47 --> 00:13:01,75
In the late 70s the women's group
started we were generally met in

158
00:13:02,86 --> 00:13:07,52
blue knob round blue knob area there was i
think there was other groups of women as

159
00:13:07,52 --> 00:13:13,05
well. Meeting and in the area. The one
that i was involved in matters blown up.

160
00:13:13,07 --> 00:13:18,62
Once a week and there was probably
up to about 12 women coming together

161
00:13:18,62 --> 00:13:23,28
and we would have have.

162
00:13:23,30 --> 00:13:29,05
That idea set agendas on some
nights themes telling us to be

163
00:13:30,28 --> 00:13:36,41
exploring options discussing things it
wasn't an incredibly angry sort of a group

164
00:13:36,41 --> 00:13:44,08
of women it was more a discovering
supportive nurturing group of women.

165
00:13:44,10 --> 00:13:49,36
You know there's the ideas of women's
groups being sort of bunches of howard

166
00:13:49,36 --> 00:13:52,64
and sort of bitching about their menfolk
and things and it wasn't like that too.

167
00:13:52,70 --> 00:13:57,35
There was there was the old
bitch of course but. You know.

168
00:13:57,36 --> 00:14:04,10
They're having their turn and. Yes.

169
00:14:04,94 --> 00:14:06,28
Yes.

170
00:14:07,17 --> 00:14:11,13
They became a tribal event
because they weren't confined to

171
00:14:14,46 --> 00:14:21,02
the birth the birth at home
became a tribal event because

172
00:14:21,78 --> 00:14:26,37
they were not confined to to
medical personnel being present

173
00:14:26,37 --> 00:14:33,17
or the official personnel being pleasant.
No just immediate family members so.

174
00:14:33,18 --> 00:14:38,55
At some births there would be maybe a dozen
people around the place people to to

175
00:14:38,55 --> 00:14:42,85
cook people to to look after other children
people to look after the other people's

176
00:14:42,85 --> 00:14:47,79
children and and general supporters
there was and people came

177
00:14:47,79 --> 00:14:51,43
and went you know if it was a long
birth of people would be coming coming

178
00:14:51,43 --> 00:14:56,52
and going and there was a lot of interest.
You know we the birth and beyond.

179
00:14:59,18 --> 00:15:03,80
Group met every tuesday and
there was prenatal classes and

180
00:15:03,80 --> 00:15:09,34
and post natal classes and so on that
and meetings of women to to support

181
00:15:09,34 --> 00:15:15,29
and fathers to the fathers because you know
you know were very actively involved in

182
00:15:15,29 --> 00:15:18,55
the whole process and the caring
of the children as well i think

183
00:15:18,55 --> 00:15:22,88
that that's something but that
isn't isn't recognized and i think

184
00:15:22,88 --> 00:15:26,67
that a lot of nimbin dads
have done a very good job.

185
00:15:27,48 --> 00:15:34,44
You know it's it's perhaps
a difficult one to sort of

186
00:15:34,44 --> 00:15:37,94
to single out isn't it wonderful
that men are involved in children

187
00:15:37,94 --> 00:15:39,35
but tradition is such that

188
00:15:39,35 --> 00:15:45,31
that men are not involved in child rearing
women you know have traditionally done

189
00:15:45,31 --> 00:15:47,45
that and sometimes that's been
something we've kept to ourselves.

190
00:15:47,87 --> 00:15:50,65
I know that for me. That
was probably an issue and

191
00:15:50,66 --> 00:15:57,55
and so yeah the menfolk have
played a part as well as being

192
00:15:57,55 --> 00:15:59,89
caught up in the more
traditional roles of how has.

193
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,65
Building and and so on

194
00:16:01,65 --> 00:16:05,13
and the women have also been involved
us first there in the house building

195
00:16:05,13 --> 00:16:14,09
and so on.

196
00:16:15,06 --> 00:16:17,67
Perhaps i didn't. Absolutely.

197
00:16:17,97 --> 00:16:23,76
I mean although i was a home birth
helper myself i had my three children in

198
00:16:23,76 --> 00:16:28,96
hospital. The first one was
because she was a breech baby.

199
00:16:29,53 --> 00:16:32,53
No she wasn't she was before the birth.

200
00:16:32,55 --> 00:16:35,40
The first one was my first child
was born in hospital because

201
00:16:35,40 --> 00:16:37,48
that the home birth movement was.

202
00:16:39,03 --> 00:16:40,05
Very young at that stage

203
00:16:40,05 --> 00:16:43,42
and i think only one baby had been
born at home in the area then

204
00:16:44,23 --> 00:16:48,50
and i didn't feel confident enough it was
later on that i got involved. Really.

205
00:16:50,22 --> 00:16:54,96
Fully my second child was born in
hospital because she was a breech baby

206
00:16:55,74 --> 00:16:58,21
and the third one there. We're
other complications in his birth.

207
00:16:58,23 --> 00:17:01,34
So they were they were
all born in the hospital

208
00:17:01,34 --> 00:17:05,88
but it was a very very positive
experience. Emily was the first baby.

209
00:17:06,39 --> 00:17:09,24
Hippie baby to be born
in lismore base hospital

210
00:17:10,69 --> 00:17:14,06
and they were very supportive i
mean we still i still had to go out

211
00:17:14,06 --> 00:17:16,59
and the go some of the
indignities like shaving and.

212
00:17:16,94 --> 00:17:20,76
An animals which don't even
happen in normal births now

213
00:17:22,66 --> 00:17:25,19
but they allowed me to do a lot
of the other things that i wanted

214
00:17:25,19 --> 00:17:30,93
and even to the point of letting me take
the centre home which they they found.

215
00:17:31,88 --> 00:17:36,28
You know the placenta was wrapped up
in and a lovely purple plastic bag and

216
00:17:36,28 --> 00:17:38,61
and kept in the refrigerator
until i went home

217
00:17:39,38 --> 00:17:45,21
and they let me out the next day you know
with a few sort of and worried looks.

218
00:17:45,22 --> 00:17:50,58
So from from that to when will was
born. It was it was beautiful.

219
00:17:50,59 --> 00:17:53,50
You know it was just really beautiful.

220
00:17:53,52 --> 00:17:58,90
Carol and norman with me i had
another friend there. His father.

221
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,22
On the birth was done in exactly the
way that i wanted to to do it out.

222
00:18:05,31 --> 00:18:11,43
You know i couldn't have asked for better
in that sort of environment and and

223
00:18:11,43 --> 00:18:16,25
and after the birth we were left alone
and he was whisked off to be bathed

224
00:18:16,25 --> 00:18:19,92
and measured and weighed and
faster and they were so i think

225
00:18:19,92 --> 00:18:26,66
that the influence of the home birth
movement in the hospitals has been has been

226
00:18:26,66 --> 00:18:30,61
good as you know and there were
some fears and difficult things

227
00:18:30,61 --> 00:18:33,63
but i think it's been overall
i think it's been good

228
00:18:33,63 --> 00:18:39,32
and in cairo called they have a birthing
center which is is the next step from

229
00:18:39,33 --> 00:18:42,10
having a home birth sort of in
between having a home birth and

230
00:18:42,81 --> 00:18:47,30
and a hospital birth. So you know
it's been influential and and i think

231
00:18:47,30 --> 00:18:51,43
that it it it in that
positive and supportive.

232
00:18:52,20 --> 00:18:53,44
Generally approach

233
00:18:53,44 --> 00:18:59,53
that the hospital has makes it easier for
women who are perhaps in a risky group to

234
00:19:00,29 --> 00:19:06,01
feel comfortable about having
their babies in the hospital as.

235
00:19:07,95 --> 00:19:09,92
Water births and things like that.

236
00:19:11,48 --> 00:19:14,18
I've not been present in a water
birth i know a number of babies

237
00:19:14,18 --> 00:19:18,62
that have been born in water birth
and i've seen the movies and so on.

238
00:19:18,74 --> 00:19:25,00
It seems wonderful and and hospitals
around the place also provide

239
00:19:25,01 --> 00:19:29,72
that service to and and
doctors are involved in it.

240
00:19:29,87 --> 00:19:34,98
I think that it's it's it just off that
now we it's not just either hospital

241
00:19:34,98 --> 00:19:37,61
or a dangerous but at homeless or so

242
00:19:37,61 --> 00:19:43,36
and you know have see the see the
options of all you were having.

243
00:19:43,46 --> 00:19:50,29
The more options recently there's been
a backlash as we always experience

244
00:19:50,29 --> 00:19:52,96
and in change and i believe that.

245
00:19:53,54 --> 00:19:59,70
You know that then non-accredited
lay midwives are not allowed to.

246
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:01,14
I deliver babies at home

247
00:20:01,14 --> 00:20:08,85
and this is i think a
very retrograde step.

248
00:20:09,68 --> 00:20:11,72
And as.

249
00:20:11,74 --> 00:20:17,97
Was.

250
00:20:17,99 --> 00:20:24,74
Traditional. I think i think it's again
about that pendulum. It's about.

251
00:20:25,36 --> 00:20:30,01
I think what had happened in the
60s the 50s and 60s postwar was

252
00:20:30,01 --> 00:20:30,43
that they'd been

253
00:20:30,43 --> 00:20:37,99
that great swing to too far to
mod cons to materialism too to.

254
00:20:38,01 --> 00:20:41,02
Getting away from from the
the spirit and community

255
00:20:42,61 --> 00:20:46,49
and so it was a very very fast
swing on the pendulum and

256
00:20:46,49 --> 00:20:50,68
and sometimes you have to to swing
the pendulum right the other way.

257
00:20:51,71 --> 00:20:55,27
You know to show all of
that stuff away so that so.

258
00:20:55,55 --> 00:21:00,97
To then come back to some kind of balance
to find out to sort out what is necessary

259
00:21:00,97 --> 00:21:06,15
and what isn't necessary to
to to find out. You know.

260
00:21:06,60 --> 00:21:11,29
A balance and and sure you know i
think there was there was a you know.

261
00:21:11,84 --> 00:21:13,69
I would never want to be scrubbing

262
00:21:13,69 --> 00:21:19,49
and washing nappies in a in a in a
copper again even if i was young

263
00:21:19,49 --> 00:21:21,58
and starting out you know it was it's.

264
00:21:22,20 --> 00:21:26,77
It was hard work and particularly for
the women. It was very very hard work.

265
00:21:26,80 --> 00:21:28,89
I think that we you know.

266
00:21:29,48 --> 00:21:35,22
The work wasn't the time often
to do a lot of the things that.

267
00:21:35,24 --> 00:21:39,31
That would have been good to do. I mean.

268
00:21:40,44 --> 00:21:45,23
I would always you know give over. Housework
in favor of playing with my children.

269
00:21:45,61 --> 00:21:47,71
So i always lived in a
fairly chaotic house but

270
00:21:47,71 --> 00:21:49,74
when you have to chop the
wood to cook the food

271
00:21:49,74 --> 00:21:52,05
when you have to cut the
water to do those things

272
00:21:52,05 --> 00:21:56,15
when you have to dig the
garden to get the the food.

273
00:21:56,17 --> 00:21:59,80
It's it's very hard work and yet
you don't need all the mod..

274
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,91
Once and things that are happening you
don't need all the fast foods and things

275
00:22:03,91 --> 00:22:05,23
and that the chemicals and.

276
00:22:05,65 --> 00:22:09,33
And so on that it that are contributing
to this duction of the planet either.

277
00:22:09,48 --> 00:22:10,29
So it's finding

278
00:22:10,29 --> 00:22:19,43
that balance.

279
00:22:19,45 --> 00:22:23,41
What are my fondest memories my
fondest memories of picnics.

280
00:22:23,58 --> 00:22:29,65
We had wonderful techniques picnics and
community gatherings and the dances.

281
00:22:31,29 --> 00:22:33,75
We we put on the birth

282
00:22:33,75 --> 00:22:38,79
and beyond bullseye
wonderful the folk club.

283
00:22:38,81 --> 00:22:45,17
The comings together of the community.
Very very special memories and.

284
00:22:46,09 --> 00:22:49,26
And the smells the night. The rain.

285
00:22:49,27 --> 00:22:55,80
When it's been sunny not the rain after
it's rained for three months. And.

286
00:22:56,16 --> 00:23:00,36
Yeah that hope that the people and
the coming together the people

287
00:23:01,15 --> 00:23:04,47
and the coming together
of many different people.

288
00:23:07,28 --> 00:23:13,21
Many of the the original settlers the
original people who lived in the main area

289
00:23:14,30 --> 00:23:18,68
are very very dear friends
of mine now. Who.

290
00:23:20,79 --> 00:23:26,30
I probably see more than a lot of the other
people who've been through nimbin over

291
00:23:26,30 --> 00:23:29,50
the years. So.

292
00:23:31,03 --> 00:23:37,09
Nimbin as a place for as a learning
ground as a wonderful learning ground a

293
00:23:37,09 --> 00:23:43,89
wonderful growing time. And it's got its
pain as well you know there's been this.

294
00:23:43,95 --> 00:23:50,67
There's been difficult time. Punk.
There's been difficult times.

295
00:23:52,54 --> 00:23:59,42
You know that the survival.
In the eighties.

296
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,58
You know. The growing apart
of my my husband and i.

297
00:24:06,60 --> 00:24:12,02
You know knowing that that this
idyllic life isn't going to to go on.

298
00:24:12,91 --> 00:24:16,11
I think maybe we we played
a lot as children too.

299
00:24:16,30 --> 00:24:22,38
You know as we played with our children.
So there was a a certain. Unreality there.

300
00:24:22,55 --> 00:24:28,10
That was very real in the dirt and
in the earth and in the being but.

301
00:24:28,90 --> 00:24:32,46
Even now i think that i was saying
to somebody today that the lifestyle

302
00:24:32,46 --> 00:24:39,10
that we have on the north coast
here. Is very special you know.

303
00:24:40,60 --> 00:24:44,53
And it's not the way a
lot of the world lives.

304
00:24:44,58 --> 00:24:50,33
It's not the way that that even the
people that i meet in my work life.

305
00:24:50,35 --> 00:24:55,09
And. I think we need to bear that
in mind as well you know that.

306
00:24:56,57 --> 00:24:59,16
There's a there's a lot of despair
and a lot of pain in the world

307
00:24:59,16 --> 00:25:02,01
and we're very fortunate. I don't know.

308
00:25:06,64 --> 00:25:15,96
And i think it was a little bit childish.

309
00:25:19,44 --> 00:25:22,88
I think that. That.

310
00:25:24,83 --> 00:25:31,71
Naivete. Was an important part of
the growing up. As an infant is a.

311
00:25:32,10 --> 00:25:37,78
An important part of the exploration
that i think nimbin is going through

312
00:25:38,82 --> 00:25:39,57
and was going through.

313
00:25:42,20 --> 00:25:47,49
To everything has a
duality and so that that

314
00:25:48,40 --> 00:25:53,16
that that childishness was part of
that the oldness of knowing that

315
00:25:53,16 --> 00:25:59,72
that things were not going right. The
wisdom that things were not going right.

316
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,85
So again to swing to to that absolute.

317
00:26:05,87 --> 00:26:09,63
Simplicity. Was it was an important part.

318
00:26:09,69 --> 00:26:12,27
If it hadn't happened it wouldn't have
you wouldn't have gone the whole way.

319
00:26:12,33 --> 00:26:15,99
It's like you've got to push the edge and.

320
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:18,31
And with all of that with

321
00:26:18,32 --> 00:26:22,93
that so-called lack of responsibility i
mean it's all a matter of perception really

322
00:26:22,93 --> 00:26:26,69
i mean i think perhaps it was a very
responsible thing to do is a very responsible

323
00:26:26,69 --> 00:26:30,33
thing to do to say hey no this.
This isn't going the right way.

324
00:26:30,34 --> 00:26:34,08
We've got to stop this
greed and destruction

325
00:26:34,08 --> 00:26:39,49
and materialistic approach to things
we've got to find community again

326
00:26:39,49 --> 00:26:44,30
and get back to to the
important things. And.

327
00:26:44,32 --> 00:26:47,04
It was very very idealistic
but unless you have.

328
00:26:47,69 --> 00:26:50,25
Something that's very idealistic
unless you should high.

329
00:26:50,60 --> 00:26:55,95
You're not going to you're not
going to going to get very far.

330
00:26:56,83 --> 00:26:58,09
So so.

331
00:26:58,61 --> 00:27:04,29
I think that it's it is important
to to have that that that openness

332
00:27:04,29 --> 00:27:10,68
and simplicity and call it naivete and
and with that then there's room to grow

333
00:27:10,68 --> 00:27:13,64
and then there's room to grow up.
If you if you if you call it that.

334
00:27:14,33 --> 00:27:19,10
To take responsibility and to see that the
shadow side of things. Then pins got it.

335
00:27:19,12 --> 00:27:25,98
Shadow side now it's acceptance has
has has on one side has led to

336
00:27:25,98 --> 00:27:32,60
abuse people who abuse that
acceptance. It's it's.

337
00:27:33,41 --> 00:27:37,42
Dropping of modern modernity

338
00:27:37,42 --> 00:27:41,84
and mod cons has led to to a lot
of people getting very tired

339
00:27:41,84 --> 00:27:47,30
and a lot of people having
to live very hard lives.

340
00:27:48,34 --> 00:27:53,69
The rejecting of the sort of
work and paid work for for.

341
00:27:56,03 --> 00:27:59,94
Supporting that capitalistic and
materialistic society that that was part.

342
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:00,14
Out of

343
00:28:00,14 --> 00:28:07,06
that has led to to perhaps an
inability to to to see other options

344
00:28:07,06 --> 00:28:09,14
for doing things.

345
00:28:09,16 --> 00:28:13,95
And that in this in turn is led to in some
cases lack of self-esteem and so on so.

346
00:28:15,56 --> 00:28:16,58
And so.

347
00:28:16,59 --> 00:28:21,07
And at the same time we've got the rainbow
power company we've got children who are

348
00:28:21,07 --> 00:28:27,01
flexible and broad thinking
and caring. We've got.

349
00:28:27,69 --> 00:28:30,39
A way of of approaching things

350
00:28:30,39 --> 00:28:36,99
that is very different with the the home
birth movement the negotiation skills.

351
00:28:37,01 --> 00:28:41,64
Community living checking it out you
know we can people can write in theory.

352
00:28:42,19 --> 00:28:44,15
About living in community

353
00:28:44,15 --> 00:28:48,15
and things were people in the nimbin area
in the north coast area because nimbin

354
00:28:48,15 --> 00:28:51,82
isn't just nimbin it's it's the north
coast and beyond and beyond and beyond.

355
00:28:53,34 --> 00:28:56,63
So people are actually doing it and have
been doing it for a long long time.

356
00:28:57,03 --> 00:29:00,76
You know buddy phones been going for a
long time tentacles been going for a long

357
00:29:00,76 --> 00:29:02,42
time and so on and so forth.

358
00:29:05,61 --> 00:29:09,96
I think the things don't
have to be. You know.

359
00:29:11,19 --> 00:29:16,35
Set in black and white.

360
00:29:16,36 --> 00:29:22,24
Oh no no no i mean it's it's it's.

361
00:29:22,25 --> 00:29:28,30
There's for me there's there's absolutely
no sense of failure. I think that.

362
00:29:29,33 --> 00:29:34,35
I mean if you if you take the approach to
life which i have which is nothing is for

363
00:29:34,35 --> 00:29:39,29
no reason that that every situation.

364
00:29:39,31 --> 00:29:45,44
Has a positive side and a negative side.

365
00:29:45,46 --> 00:29:49,21
Every cloud has a silver lining.

366
00:29:49,23 --> 00:29:51,79
So you know

367
00:29:51,79 --> 00:29:57,50
that the growing of nimbin the developing
of nimbin the moving on from from the

368
00:29:57,50 --> 00:30:00,26
original aquarius dream. It's perfect.

369
00:30:00,79 --> 00:30:05,24
You know it's it's it's there is
there is pain and there is there is.

370
00:30:08,00 --> 00:30:12,02
Some some really negative things
that that could be focused on

371
00:30:12,02 --> 00:30:14,66
and there were there and there
are the positive things

372
00:30:14,66 --> 00:30:19,41
and if you see it on a long term basis if
you see it in them in the continuum of

373
00:30:19,41 --> 00:30:25,21
ages. It's just a my new little thing
you know and the effects of it are huge

374
00:30:25,21 --> 00:30:28,62
and so. If you. You know.

375
00:30:28,98 --> 00:30:32,50
I refuse to get caught
up in any breast beating

376
00:30:32,50 --> 00:30:38,46
and angst about it you know it's
it is what is and and it's growing

377
00:30:38,46 --> 00:30:41,03
and people are still talking about it.

378
00:30:41,86 --> 00:30:45,10
People are still talking about a
close 20 years on that's you know

379
00:30:45,10 --> 00:30:50,50
and people you know young
people are. Still holders.

380
00:30:50,75 --> 00:30:57,58
Or develop those ideals. And and the older
people who've been involved in aquarius.

381
00:31:00,05 --> 00:31:04,76
The division changes but. Once
an aquarian always an aquarium.

382
00:31:04,78 --> 00:31:06,72
You know i wasn't even
there for the festival.

383
00:31:07,07 --> 00:31:11,82
You know.

384
00:31:13,47 --> 00:31:17,07
Frivolous.

385
00:31:18,81 --> 00:31:22,10
What is no world.

386
00:31:22,12 --> 00:31:26,27
I. Right.

387
00:31:29,64 --> 00:31:36,21
Well that they had their head in
there's a move of nimbin is. Is good.
