1
00:00:02,20 --> 00:00:04,14
I'm speaking to mr. Crawley who worked as

2
00:00:04,14 --> 00:00:08,03
a laborer on the north pylon. Do you member
getting the job on the harbor bridge to

3
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:08,41
you mr.

4
00:00:08,41 --> 00:00:13,18
Crawley. Yes. My brother was working on the
bridge and i was on the dowel and they

5
00:00:13,18 --> 00:00:18,40
came and they said you can start tomorrow
morning and becca feel like. And i went

6
00:00:18,40 --> 00:00:23,91
down i started on the pick and shovel and
how long did you work there. I was there

7
00:00:23,91 --> 00:00:26,77
about three months and i went up on

8
00:00:26,77 --> 00:00:32,83
a pile and washed and down all the stone
work was splashed with acid and while i

9
00:00:32,83 --> 00:00:34,18
was there and i was put in

10
00:00:34,18 --> 00:00:39,37
a plank of course to the entrance to the
pylon. And i got pulled down through the

11
00:00:39,37 --> 00:00:43,08
weight of the plank display as i
know and i just met that i made

12
00:00:43,08 --> 00:00:46,94
a measure called i spittle i
was in there free weeks. Was

13
00:00:46,94 --> 00:00:53,38
a badly broken wrist and bad concussion.
Do you remember what the work was like

14
00:00:53,38 --> 00:00:59,22
before you got down on the turn of the
base of the pylon it was very hard it was

15
00:01:00,02 --> 00:01:03,98
all on the pick and shovel there was no
front end loaders or anything like that.

16
00:01:04,19 --> 00:01:10,44
And there were rocks and bits of cement and
blue metal only it was that frightened

17
00:01:10,44 --> 00:01:17,40
been. Put all fear didn't pull you away it
but you never even looked up because it

18
00:01:17,40 --> 00:01:23,04
was only one thing stay there or go back
on the dow you actually were cleaning up

19
00:01:23,04 --> 00:01:23,24
around

20
00:01:23,24 --> 00:01:27,98
a pile on after the bridge had been built
was that plan and up to all of that be

21
00:01:27,98 --> 00:01:34,83
leveled off and cleaned up and
made ready to put turf him and we

22
00:01:34,83 --> 00:01:40,66
were there when all of phoenician up there
was no now front end loaders used to

23
00:01:40,66 --> 00:01:46,77
further i can remember. Did you work for
dorman long or for the public works work

24
00:01:46,77 --> 00:01:51,72
for dome along. I was. Mr.

25
00:01:51,72 --> 00:01:58,71
Jim you always was the boss. They had
over me. A lot i was red. Like i just

26
00:01:58,71 --> 00:02:01,42
remember the gang as time but it was

27
00:02:01,42 --> 00:02:07,80
a scotchman he was on the bridge. I think
from the first day it opened. Yes was to

28
00:02:07,80 --> 00:02:11,46
be it was a reserve right
then what was he like i was

29
00:02:11,46 --> 00:02:17,36
a nice fellow for it. I remember like it
didn't. As long as you oppose your weight

30
00:02:17,36 --> 00:02:22,90
but you had always that share because you
were frightened that you might get put

31
00:02:22,90 --> 00:02:26,17
off. What union were you
in those days they are

32
00:02:26,17 --> 00:02:31,20
w you. As far as i can remember was the
air and then do you remember any union

33
00:02:31,20 --> 00:02:36,84
activity. Now there was no trouble while
i was there it was very good. No travel

34
00:02:36,84 --> 00:02:41,28
whatever because the men were still
frightened because travel because she was

35
00:02:41,28 --> 00:02:46,61
killed there was only one thing stop on
the job or go back on the dole. What was

36
00:02:46,61 --> 00:02:51,34
the working conditions like around the
drug they were pretty crude there wasn't

37
00:02:51,34 --> 00:02:55,54
much. I mean that these roy and i think
like that they were coarse everywhere was

38
00:02:55,54 --> 00:03:02,28
rough in them days they were bad times. A
moat was very crude. Dress way it changed

39
00:03:02,28 --> 00:03:07,61
and all that there was wasn't there near
men at these. And how much you get paid

40
00:03:08,74 --> 00:03:13,82
well i think i just can't remember rightly.
But i think it was about four pound

41
00:03:13,82 --> 00:03:18,39
a week when we were libron but we
worked one time though i remember up on

42
00:03:18,39 --> 00:03:25,16
a pile and. We when i it was right on the
top we got money and wet money and one

43
00:03:25,16 --> 00:03:29,85
thing and other and i think about mariah
tli i've got to referee. I think it was

44
00:03:29,85 --> 00:03:33,27
about 11:00 p.m. On but we was
workman about eleven hours

45
00:03:33,27 --> 00:03:37,76
a day and seven days that week and
i think it was about 11:00 p.m.

46
00:03:37,76 --> 00:03:44,27
And if i remember rightly. What was it
like living down the pylons. It was. A bit

47
00:03:44,27 --> 00:03:49,16
frightened and that first the height worried
yeah because she had been down on the

48
00:03:49,16 --> 00:03:54,29
answers and you know to wash all that top
and i remember distinctly one day the

49
00:03:54,29 --> 00:03:56,25
first day we went up there was

50
00:03:56,25 --> 00:04:01,90
a chap there i can't think of his name but
he had seven and family and they said

51
00:04:02,60 --> 00:04:07,46
look at it said i don't think i can stand
this he said this height. He said. Five

52
00:04:07,46 --> 00:04:13,55
stop up fall over. So i said tell him.
Well it's not worrying me so much. I'll

53
00:04:13,55 --> 00:04:18,54
there round the edges i said new deal
inside. And now he did that all day but i

54
00:04:18,54 --> 00:04:22,67
didn't turn up next morning at 10:00 at
the end he said if he couldn't stand the

55
00:04:22,67 --> 00:04:28,11
eye he would have fell over for you know
just stopped up there. To do have any

56
00:04:28,11 --> 00:04:33,14
safety ropes were you tied on at all and
not in them days there was no ropes there

57
00:04:33,14 --> 00:04:36,94
was just there on the phone and he was
down on you know and just you know just

58
00:04:36,94 --> 00:04:43,54
watch by strand and then if you couldn't
stand up the i was sunk. You know. But

59
00:04:44,24 --> 00:04:48,54
even down the ladder. They
used to have to go down

60
00:04:48,54 --> 00:04:54,09
a ladder directly down the side of the pylon
and they are doyle trestle saying and

61
00:04:54,09 --> 00:04:58,39
from the top that just stood on to wash
the stone but you had to go down the

62
00:04:58,39 --> 00:05:01,10
ladders no ladder worse why and but after

63
00:05:01,10 --> 00:05:06,42
a couple of days you thought i think of it.
What did you wash the pylons down with

64
00:05:06,42 --> 00:05:13,42
with spirits just souls tears of some
house that they call it. Well this

65
00:05:13,42 --> 00:05:19,22
year to lift the concrete cement.
But yet. Why should because with

66
00:05:19,22 --> 00:05:25,23
a steel brush and you wasn't allowed to use
too much acid because it had sand stone

67
00:05:25,23 --> 00:05:28,36
yellow. Show yet to get
in the way of just using

68
00:05:28,36 --> 00:05:34,30
a certain amount of acid the very hard
work because you had to scrub with this

69
00:05:34,30 --> 00:05:39,96
steel brush and the cement was very hard
and that. And you had to practically get

70
00:05:39,96 --> 00:05:45,00
a ball or because the ganger used to come
along and look at it and see if it was ok

71
00:05:45,01 --> 00:05:51,96
. Do you remember getting the acid
on you know you. Kept the acid away

72
00:05:51,96 --> 00:05:58,39
from you know because just let it burn. But
it was bad on you're close to do supply

73
00:05:58,39 --> 00:06:03,44
a special close. Now there was you know
supplies you know and clouds or low clouds

74
00:06:03,44 --> 00:06:07,94
you used you went in and then you.
Close and then you change it into more

75
00:06:09,05 --> 00:06:15,58
practically rags you know because the acid
played up with it and burnt it did you

76
00:06:15,58 --> 00:06:20,30
wear goggles to protect your eyes. Now
there was no goggles as i remember yet. No

77
00:06:20,30 --> 00:06:26,04
further when they gave us no protective
clothes and i can't just remember whether

78
00:06:26,04 --> 00:06:32,53
they gave us gloves i'm not sure that
i wouldn't really say but it was

79
00:06:33,23 --> 00:06:37,58
bad you had to be very careful with the
after that it didn't get on you because it

80
00:06:37,58 --> 00:06:44,45
was it was just put so much water with
it and and pressed it down like to

81
00:06:44,45 --> 00:06:51,02
make it better. Do you remember any
accidents while you were there. Now the

82
00:06:51,02 --> 00:06:57,88
only acts and i remember was i can't
remember my own accident. But while i was in

83
00:06:57,88 --> 00:07:02,05
the hospital. I remember the wife
coming over to see me and there was

84
00:07:02,05 --> 00:07:07,67
a rigger there eyes i saw i knew him.
I can't think of a name but he was

85
00:07:07,67 --> 00:07:09,80
a big scotchman and it was

86
00:07:09,80 --> 00:07:14,51
a leading lady rigger and he'd been on the
bridge practically ever since the steel

87
00:07:14,51 --> 00:07:21,24
started and he was up and they were removed
and from the top of the sydneysider

88
00:07:21,24 --> 00:07:26,58
the pylon and it was practically the last
job they were taking the trestles away

89
00:07:26,58 --> 00:07:33,44
that you used to hang down to to wash the
stone and my wife said to me because

90
00:07:33,45 --> 00:07:34,87
she said there's a there's

91
00:07:34,87 --> 00:07:39,91
a chap up there on the top of the pile and
then she said if he doesn't get knocked

92
00:07:39,91 --> 00:07:41,57
up she said might. I'm not

93
00:07:41,57 --> 00:07:47,36
a bad judge she said there's all there she
said it keeps on blown round and nearly

94
00:07:47,36 --> 00:07:52,37
hit me. Him and there now. It was in the
paper that night where it fell off and he

95
00:07:52,37 --> 00:07:55,47
fell down and my brother was was put in

96
00:07:55,47 --> 00:08:00,91
a fish plate on the joint of the rail and
the force of the four in the top of the

97
00:08:00,91 --> 00:08:07,07
pile and sandy was true to sleep as the
space between two sleepers and i just

98
00:08:07,07 --> 00:08:11,63
missed the brother where he was set and put
my fish plate on him and he was killed

99
00:08:11,63 --> 00:08:17,17
instantly. They say that he was practically
killed before he hit the bottom of the

100
00:08:17,17 --> 00:08:23,53
thing that i caught the brickwork as he
fell. You know it was james campbell. That

101
00:08:23,54 --> 00:08:25,41
was james campbell campbell was

102
00:08:25,41 --> 00:08:31,41
a yeah well my wife saw him on
top of the top of the pile and

103
00:08:32,91 --> 00:08:38,68
. Do remember any other acts and strong.
Now not while i was there and there was no

104
00:08:38,68 --> 00:08:44,98
other because i was only up on the stone
work at about. A fortnight of free weeks

105
00:08:44,98 --> 00:08:51,30
when i fell. Who do you remember any stories
that stuck in your mind over the years

106
00:08:52,69 --> 00:08:59,41
now. They only thing that used amazed
me all the time i was there was

107
00:08:59,41 --> 00:09:06,30
the whistle and go to blow for lunch
dinner or not go. And i would hardly see

108
00:09:06,30 --> 00:09:07,41
a man and all of

109
00:09:07,41 --> 00:09:12,21
a sudden yet so you had come and for me
everywhere every little hour. They'd be

110
00:09:12,21 --> 00:09:13,43
a man and there it be

111
00:09:13,43 --> 00:09:19,38
a the boiler mike painter or something
like that and it was amazing to see that

112
00:09:19,39 --> 00:09:26,39
come out like rabbits everywhere and i never
forgot that i can see that even i can

113
00:09:26,39 --> 00:09:31,96
see it now the whistle gone and they had
come out and these and yet to see them go

114
00:09:31,96 --> 00:09:35,87
on. It wasn't my eyes on them
go on because that go one at

115
00:09:35,87 --> 00:09:40,99
a time and all that but they must have
been like certainly waiting for the way so

116
00:09:40,99 --> 00:09:43,88
they go and pop out it comes ahead. It was

117
00:09:43,88 --> 00:09:48,97
a mile at worst you know and i can see
it there now everywhere there'd be

118
00:09:48,97 --> 00:09:54,10
a hedge coming out of they'd be out say
they'd be inside. The steel work. And

119
00:09:54,10 --> 00:09:54,72
wherever there was

120
00:09:54,72 --> 00:10:01,69
a loud sea ahead. Perhaps the dress i made.
You were going back to work that quick

121
00:10:01,70 --> 00:10:08,61
as well. Well no i wouldn't say that but
still at first as i say everyone was short

122
00:10:08,61 --> 00:10:14,27
on that because they knew the job mean
everything to him until i finished. Although

123
00:10:14,27 --> 00:10:20,48
there was very lucky i was talking to one
of the older hands at the reunion and i

124
00:10:20,48 --> 00:10:25,63
said to him i said well i said the thing
was that. At all. Flies just back on the

125
00:10:25,63 --> 00:10:31,05
dow and he said now i was like he said i
went to new england. And i said i bought

126
00:10:31,05 --> 00:10:31,92
a boat

127
00:10:31,92 --> 00:10:38,02
a block of land. And he said i struggled
till the war he said i went it then the

128
00:10:38,02 --> 00:10:40,38
war. Come back and they said i've got

129
00:10:40,38 --> 00:10:45,22
a government loan and he said i've never
looked back. He said today i'm sitting on

130
00:10:45,22 --> 00:10:51,17
top of the land. So what happened to you.
Well i went back on the dole. There was

131
00:10:51,17 --> 00:10:56,91
nothing else for me but i went back on the
dole and struggled frail and nineteen

132
00:10:56,91 --> 00:11:03,40
thirty for christmas 1933.
I got called up to work on

133
00:11:04,34 --> 00:11:09,36
government transport buses and i finished
up there thirty eight years after.

134
00:11:09,79 --> 00:11:10,34
There's

135
00:11:10,34 --> 00:11:17,03
a bus driver but driver. You tell me were
being on the dole what it was like we are

136
00:11:17,03 --> 00:11:22,31
on coupons were you. It was very hard being
on the dow when i first register for

137
00:11:22,31 --> 00:11:27,80
the dow you had to go down to the wharf i
forget the number the wharf and you had

138
00:11:27,80 --> 00:11:29,44
to register there and it got

139
00:11:29,44 --> 00:11:35,31
a doubt take it. And you came back. But i
only had to do it once i had to report

140
00:11:35,31 --> 00:11:40,87
a key key street railway square
and they used to give me

141
00:11:40,87 --> 00:11:47,45
a hand out food and like you know.
Well he had a shell game bag i had

142
00:11:47,45 --> 00:11:49,80
a sugar bag i wasn't ashamed to carry

143
00:11:49,80 --> 00:11:55,35
a shield from the bush and i shall go bag
was the bushman portmanteau. That was

144
00:11:55,35 --> 00:11:57,46
a suitcase. Well i had

145
00:11:57,46 --> 00:12:02,63
a sugar bag. And i got my tucker in the
shoulder bag and brought it home to mum

146
00:12:05,08 --> 00:12:11,45
. And that was that remembering before the
you were on the bridge or after that was

147
00:12:11,45 --> 00:12:16,37
before i that's when i first registered i
was out of work for about three months

148
00:12:17,20 --> 00:12:23,51
and then jack land border there
in the east. He gave concessions

149
00:12:23,51 --> 00:12:24,94
a real wonderful man he was

150
00:12:24,94 --> 00:12:31,22
a greatest man in the world ever was. And
our he brought it down and he he was more

151
00:12:31,22 --> 00:12:36,48
lenient with the swiss work and
last and then a man ever noun and

152
00:12:36,49 --> 00:12:43,47
a brought it in to socialize. The dial and
you went to the council unguarded which

153
00:12:43,47 --> 00:12:43,86
made it

154
00:12:43,86 --> 00:12:49,68
a lot easier drip audit the council and yet
get chewed out take it and you take it

155
00:12:49,68 --> 00:12:54,56
and i was very lucky i
got very friendly with

156
00:12:54,56 --> 00:13:00,55
a young fellow that was a
manager of a vital store and

157
00:13:00,56 --> 00:13:04,68
a very good to my terrible
good to me and it was through

158
00:13:04,68 --> 00:13:11,57
a lot of years helped that i managed. Two
to exist on the dow. I used to give me

159
00:13:11,57 --> 00:13:18,45
all bacon bones and cracked eggs
and and broken best kits and all

160
00:13:18,46 --> 00:13:19,14
them kind

161
00:13:19,14 --> 00:13:24,18
a little things which they found little
but they counted up in them days. Well i

162
00:13:24,18 --> 00:13:29,38
used to weigh out potatoes and onions and
them kind of thing for him and he'd say

163
00:13:30,61 --> 00:13:35,90
well take a few potatoes for yourself.
Pat take a few onions. But i sound

164
00:13:35,90 --> 00:13:40,97
a little but in them days they were wonderful
help and i doubt my very much. And

165
00:13:40,97 --> 00:13:41,42
then i had

166
00:13:41,42 --> 00:13:47,83
a good sister in law. She she was work and
that woolen mills and they were doing on

167
00:13:47,83 --> 00:13:50,07
about three four days

168
00:13:50,07 --> 00:13:57,04
a week they were on ration time but she
used to help very you know with money.

169
00:13:57,07 --> 00:14:01,52
Well if you had a couple of bob shell
and you could buy a side a lamb for

170
00:14:01,52 --> 00:14:03,20
a few bob. Well that was

171
00:14:03,20 --> 00:14:08,37
a great help our band the money that's the
only time in my memory that if you had

172
00:14:08,37 --> 00:14:13,63
money you could do something with it.
Things were cheap but you didn't have the

173
00:14:13,63 --> 00:14:16,99
money to buy the things we were

174
00:14:16,99 --> 00:14:20,79
a bit lucky that way that she
kept on work. And she was getting

175
00:14:20,79 --> 00:14:27,76
a few days all the time and goodness
we managed to pull through. If

176
00:14:27,76 --> 00:14:33,70
you had no money. How would you go on about
cooking for instance. Well he threw the

177
00:14:33,70 --> 00:14:40,12
sister in law the few bob that she was
brought home. We used to pay our gas and the

178
00:14:40,12 --> 00:14:41,88
instalments a couple of bob at

179
00:14:41,88 --> 00:14:46,71
a time. We used to pay our electric light
and then store months and therefore we

180
00:14:46,71 --> 00:14:51,02
got back got through we
owed no debts. My wife was

181
00:14:51,02 --> 00:14:56,66
a wonderful manager. And we owed
nothing. We kept our out above water and

182
00:14:56,67 --> 00:15:02,20
a friend of ours used to do dress make
them and the wife was terrible good with

183
00:15:02,20 --> 00:15:09,01
their fingers and she made all the clothes
for the boy and girl and powder pieces

184
00:15:09,01 --> 00:15:15,91
of material that distressed my years
together. But the last twelve months for

185
00:15:15,91 --> 00:15:21,79
various odd on my own the wife because
our clothes that we had were starting to

186
00:15:21,79 --> 00:15:28,36
deteriorate and you didn't have the money
to buy new ones. But then the part

187
00:15:28,37 --> 00:15:34,84
social service station first with boots
and trousers and that and that was

188
00:15:34,84 --> 00:15:41,40
a great help. Just at the finish.
What about rent. Well. I was lucky

189
00:15:42,18 --> 00:15:47,79
i got put out of our house because i owed
him i was living in that for eighteen

190
00:15:47,79 --> 00:15:53,86

were on the dole looking around for work.

242
00:19:54,69 --> 00:20:01,62
How did you get around. We walk walk walk
everywhere is right. Talia fellowship was

243
00:20:01,62 --> 00:20:06,33
wonderful. At the lorries used to go
slow. If there were three or four of us

244
00:20:06,33 --> 00:20:10,84
walking along the road the lorries that
slow up and we'd all our pon the back of

245
00:20:10,84 --> 00:20:14,58
the lorry we never paid
any fares and and then he

246
00:20:14,58 --> 00:20:20,06
d up when we'd all up off and we accept
round. And they'd come out and say you know

247
00:20:20,06 --> 00:20:24,81
call it follows then but they were the job
was all by contrary. Yeah you know oh

248
00:20:24,81 --> 00:20:29,75
people. You'd go in and ask them anything
they'd say along here been out of work

249
00:20:29,75 --> 00:20:34,93
york and you know that now i get.
So you know finished you've got

250
00:20:34,93 --> 00:20:40,10
a start and that's why i'm so sorry for the
four younger people today. I understand

251
00:20:41,48 --> 00:20:45,60
and you get into a groove and you just
don't want to do it if anyone had

252
00:20:45,60 --> 00:20:48,40
a town me when i got out
of work. The two and

253
00:20:48,40 --> 00:20:53,25
a half years later. I would have been
satisfied to go up girl with oval and sit

254
00:20:53,25 --> 00:20:58,18
round all day and watch the unemployed
cricket teams and football teams like to

255
00:20:58,18 --> 00:21:02,98
tell them that they were lunatics. But it
comes to you. You get into that groove.

256
00:21:03,19 --> 00:21:10,03
And that's why i am so sorry for the young
people today. Where did you come from
