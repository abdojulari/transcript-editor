00:00:16,61 --> 00:00:22,24
Identification this is an interview with the Faith Bandler and pain

2
00:00:22,24 --> 00:00:35,5
and pray session one eight one five one accorded in Sydney on Anzac Day April twenty five nineteen ninety seven,

3
00:00:35,5 --> 00:00:59,88
the tape begins in approximately ten seconds time they say.

4
00:00:59,88 --> 00:01:13,31
Let's begin at the beginning where were you born at school in the village on the north coast of New South Wales.

5
00:01:13,31 --> 00:01:22,66
The name of the village 's well it only had to.

6
00:01:22,66 --> 00:01:39,77
It had to pass our data adequate to grocery stores, Baker and a butcher who was North consultant will

7
00:01:40,89 --> 00:02:03,92
and they were linked by a ferry service which elected continues a shout all about ferry service was very important,

8
00:02:03,92 --> 00:02:12,74
but so was that the ferry man as we called in to your and ran the fairy he lived close day

9
00:02:12,74 --> 00:02:20,25
and we liked him because we buffered with him a little she had decent we had chooks use in the resort was a bit of an

10
00:02:20,25 --> 00:02:33,43
exchange. but If I make to the hole that I was born in adequate period editor.

11
00:02:33,43 --> 00:02:47,35
It was made of lamps of feed timber theatre was grounded in that area that the area had grapeseed forests before they

12
00:02:47,35 --> 00:02:50,72
were all chopped up and sent off

13
00:02:50,72 --> 00:03:03,53
and it is that house very fresh in my memory to the kitchen that had now if you will start

14
00:03:03,53 --> 00:03:17,99
and a great big table in the centre out that Armidale, then it had two bedrooms of the and one-bedroom for the law.

15
00:03:17,99 --> 00:03:27,55
He later said that he and my mother and father 's bedroom and it was all very rough, some L3.

16
00:03:27,55 --> 00:03:36,05
Our floor was actually made us see that as land and in the winter.

17
00:03:36,05 --> 00:03:42,47
My mother will down make sure that there were many to keep the place.

18
00:03:42,47 --> 00:03:44,87
All rights for the floor

19
00:03:44,87 --> 00:03:53,26
and somebody's she would make itself from the scraps that were left over from our address issues make a student

20
00:03:53,26 --> 00:04:05,9
and align it with a line that would cash in the house. All this of course was third dealt by my father.

21
00:04:05,9 --> 00:04:10,66
The powers are all part of his that countrymen

22
00:04:10,66 --> 00:04:23,2
and they were made up basically a twenty people who escaped are working from on the canefields in North Queensland,

23
00:04:23,2 --> 00:04:31,66
and they had come down to the Tweed in that area to be independent to start their market gardens and so forth.

24
00:04:31,66 --> 00:04:36,34
So they help my father back up the timber they wanted to the forest timber

25
00:04:36,34 --> 00:04:52,51
and they built this was a very open as it had done this sick Bay and I am how and

26
00:04:52,51 --> 00:05:03,19
when these people who come from the at the word were dysplasia. Since little trains are came out of the Tweed.

27
00:05:03,19 --> 00:05:12,73
It was cold and many of them go to bronchitis and banking influenza bronchitis, pneumonia

28
00:05:12,73 --> 00:05:15,39
and that they would come to our play

29
00:05:15,39 --> 00:05:25,76
and they will someone a rare in fact that they be allowed today is the last time at night would be taken care of by a

30
00:05:25,76 --> 00:05:34,74
mother mother and will keep on going to wait on the mother mother would say, for instance, cooking the evening meal

31
00:05:34,74 --> 00:05:40,37
and then she set up a great big tin tray which were used to trace

32
00:05:40,56 --> 00:05:52,00
and that she get us to take the merely hinder whoever was sick and is a very sick. She certainly tender my illness.

33
00:05:52,00 --> 00:06:02,77
Remember, so that people who had a temperature and should take the addition of cold water and a small bowel

34
00:06:02,77 --> 00:06:10,25
and Kalimna bring the clutter and put it on the forehead the fan and coolant.

35
00:06:11,41 --> 00:06:14,1
Sometimes my father would call the ambulance.

36
00:06:14,1 --> 00:06:15,94
Then they go off to hospital

37
00:06:15,94 --> 00:06:24,98
but many a time they would just stay there someone he'll make that my mother 's attention and good care

38
00:06:25,02 --> 00:06:32,95
and they go path that many eight two, so the existence and efficient manner

39
00:06:32,95 --> 00:06:41,46
and to search our early childhood memories now that was my mother 's kitchen that had described with the table in the

40
00:06:41,46 --> 00:06:41,92
centre

41
00:06:41,92 --> 00:06:56,63
and so forth at the best thing at the back of the hut that was whether vegetable out what this which will eventually

42
00:06:56,63 --> 00:07:04,34
lived after that we never knew that there was such a thing as the greengrocer in existence at whilst my father 's

43
00:07:04,58 --> 00:07:14,93
outhouse kitchen is to have it was just made a ten under high and it had an earthen floor and matter

44
00:07:14,93 --> 00:07:19,46
and flooring in the centre was this huge log fireplace

45
00:07:20,62 --> 00:07:27,2
and at night after the evening the little woodchips would Gandhi who is our father

46
00:07:27,2 --> 00:07:34,74
and we had done to my thesis to sit on,

47
00:07:34,74 --> 00:07:45,88
which will really the case that was used for packing bananas in an my father had he is that no one would ever sit on

48
00:07:45,88 --> 00:07:56,44
his hands at the bus would just take over) sit on the floor is very close to the phone at the farm was wonderful

49
00:07:56,44 --> 00:08:08,13
and there was a huge kettle hung on the English chain from the year roof and it would be

50
00:08:08,13 --> 00:08:16,91
and it good being softly as background music to this storytelling engine

51
00:08:16,91 --> 00:08:29,75
and the way a certain story which happen to be is not my favourite may be the favourite of one of my sisters all one

52
00:08:29,75 --> 00:08:41,38
hundred and to mislead or gather around the fire we all put in for our favourite story and I can before

53
00:08:41,38 --> 00:08:51,22
and as he told of whilst he told a thousand times and afterwards Bayesian again and again and again

54
00:08:51,22 --> 00:08:52,73
and I didn't understand.

55
00:08:52,73 --> 00:08:58,75
but That was about until Bethlehem granddaughter and she would want to hear the same story thousand pounds

56
00:08:58,75 --> 00:09:12,17
and he would tell us the and the story and it was when he will want to illustrate, for instance, how far

57
00:09:12,48 --> 00:09:27,48
when he was kidnapped and taken by the latest and what it was like in the coming over from his island

58
00:09:27,48 --> 00:09:30,15
and broken in the new pretext.

59
00:09:30,92 --> 00:09:35,73
The class and how they will feel the whole

60
00:09:35,73 --> 00:09:43,35
and how to think that with those who doubt they would be thrown overboard Howard,

61
00:09:43,35 --> 00:09:50,00
whilst the money that was a variety of Australia and Australians.

62
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:58,77
Everything seemed to him and I just ask you what year it was that he was taken from the meeting

63
00:09:58,77 --> 00:10:12,74
and also how old was he and what were his reaction as that presumably very young man, so he was about thirteen,

64
00:10:12,74 --> 00:10:19,99
in the year of eighteen eighty three when he was captured and brought to Australia landed in my car.

65
00:10:19,99 --> 00:10:20,57
They

66
00:10:21,84 --> 00:10:31,97
and herself always remember him telling us that stranger files to see these huge animals like the great draft told that

67
00:10:31,97 --> 00:10:47,62
a that and all the beautiful bird that was strange to hear Matt and powers it in her it was Sam

68
00:10:47,62 --> 00:10:56,19
and another world another world, so these stories would go around the fireplace and as intelligent,

69
00:10:56,19 --> 00:11:14,43
once we beg for him to tell it again and again and he liked Festival Hall wants wits with powers to the car

70
00:11:15,89 --> 00:11:27,5
and he say all that he is now it is all current cars car being forced fantastic he that they became

71
00:11:27,5 --> 00:11:34,38
and its baby car came the mother cow. He was a boy of thirteen or fourteen. Such a large animals.

72
00:11:34,38 --> 00:11:41,26
He had never seen through the stories would go around fireplace.

73
00:11:41,26 --> 00:11:48,45
The dreams he would have known he was great believer in tree

74
00:11:48,45 --> 00:11:57,18
and likely to keep retailers stories around the fireplace at night and they next morning, very early, of course,

75
00:11:57,18 --> 00:12:02,16
as we have relevant as she would try and recaptured history

76
00:12:02,88 --> 00:12:13,75
and then he interpreted according to what he believed all conditions like when he first came to Australia what,

77
00:12:13,75 --> 00:12:25,88
what work was to do and where what he was them that will hinder thirteen fourteen when he arrived in Australia

78
00:12:25,88 --> 00:12:28,49
and conditions.

79
00:12:28,49 --> 00:12:33,85
Even in the staff were very primitive follow from all workers

80
00:12:33,85 --> 00:12:40,11
but it's hard to describe how hard it flies in North Queensland.

81
00:12:40,11 --> 00:12:43,93
It was the least circulating at the same

82
00:12:43,99 --> 00:12:54,96
when the cane industry started in the north that it was too hot for paying workers to work in that industry the now

83
00:12:54,96 --> 00:13:06,89
that was the excuse used by the traders in Islanders Lara is that they need black people who could stand up to fifty

84
00:13:07,7 --> 00:13:14,5
and the Queensland Gap State government in fact accepted that without question

85
00:13:14,5 --> 00:13:23,11
and do so that Turkey was one of sixty thousand who was brought over from the islands were kidnapped.

86
00:13:23,11 --> 00:13:29,38
Most of its true, some say that they agreed to cut agreed to come.

87
00:13:29,38 --> 00:13:36,55
I don't dispute back, but only gather stories of my father told me so as the younger, i.e.

88
00:13:36,55 --> 00:13:40,1
He was in those days they were being so on.

89
00:13:40,1 --> 00:13:49,9
I'll I think it was seventy pounds ahead the bigger they were all they got the men from China at AMP,

90
00:13:49,9 --> 00:13:54,97
which was my phone as they will quite be quite tall.

91
00:13:54,97 --> 00:14:10,63
He was very to all heedless that it are six one three six foot for any humans bit free say he was sent to work on the

92
00:14:10,63 --> 00:14:21,53
farm billeted in that which was built in for those who are brought over to where they had men's barracks

93
00:14:21,53 --> 00:14:27,33
and women's barracks in the city of Mackay in north Queensland

94
00:14:27,33 --> 00:14:37,74
and the sun will actually be sent at the barracks because they were very hot in summer

95
00:14:37,74 --> 00:14:40,4
and they took to building their own

96
00:14:40,4 --> 00:14:50,4
and shacks with thatched roofs cc with cooler for the summer months while he was found he was related.

97
00:14:50,4 --> 00:14:58,07
All he was put to live with all the men and he fathers of his age.

98
00:14:58,07 --> 00:15:03,72
when The sun was at a summarised in the morning the Belmont during the whistle

99
00:15:04,75 --> 00:15:14,84
and they have to be ready to go into the field and they would work there until sunset, then that their number.

100
00:15:14,84 --> 00:15:26,74
Chris and they would be allowed to go back to the barracks and they had a ration and it was a very poor race and many,

101
00:15:26,74 --> 00:15:41,00
many of those people that are in fact they would be dropping dead in the canefields and buried, Graves,

102
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:48,97
mainly because of the strange life regular hours hard work can be for 's hand

103
00:15:48,97 --> 00:16:02,35
and no longer having than nourishing diet of all fish and seafood are good however the lens you sweet potatoes,

104
00:16:02,35 --> 00:16:09,95
tomatoes, wasn't there and they were given rations but the owners of the same,

105
00:16:09,95 --> 00:16:20,13
that the aboriginal people were given on their research that was flour tea, sugar much else.

106
00:16:20,13 --> 00:16:28,46
In fact, and fall from the slaughter houses if they were lucky,

107
00:16:28,46 --> 00:16:39,27
so it is in fact seventy died that a Royal commission was established in Queensland to investigate the living

108
00:16:39,27 --> 00:16:49,08
conditions of the island was at the data. The findings were that they were seen to be very undernourished.

109
00:16:49,08 --> 00:16:58,02
My father stayed there and worked on the plane and for about twenty years

110
00:16:59,36 --> 00:17:08,93
and finally he felt well enough is in his brother was brought with him and who was my uncle

111
00:17:09,25 --> 00:17:17,36
and said well you can hang research and kind.

112
00:17:17,36 --> 00:17:21,94
It is my twenty year will Henry 's yarn,

113
00:17:21,94 --> 00:17:34,5
and he was/ Annandale is in what happened was that there were like my aunt Kate also came

114
00:17:34,5 --> 00:17:45,03
and that she was working in the house of the owner of the came and she became she was became a very able capable

115
00:17:45,03 --> 00:17:53,38
and manager out household duties, and when it became was put in charge of the Adelaide servants

116
00:17:53,38 --> 00:18:00,6
and their job of course was basically Audrey to the cooking

117
00:18:00,6 --> 00:18:07,01
and I think that some of these people survived because of what Kate was getting regularly and at worst,

118
00:18:07,01 --> 00:18:16,12
taking the home-made matter and nourishment from the farmers kitchen and she taken at night to the barracks.

119
00:18:16,12 --> 00:18:23,94
It is a bit of nourishment is easier to boil the water before they drank at the simple things like that.

120
00:18:23,94 --> 00:18:34,35
and Of course the English game for an Irishman boss at which was very valuable because it was turned into sugar,

121
00:18:34,35 --> 00:18:48,37
so I am not just my father 's life that they had twenty year are they were called the Queensland government call them

122
00:18:48,37 --> 00:18:56,85
connected and that is the other way and word which he just man,

123
00:18:56,85 --> 00:19:01,88
and yet they were people who came from many different gardens with their very different cultures

124
00:19:01,96 --> 00:19:12,67
and do you like saying out to a hunger calling a hung area.

125
00:19:12,67 --> 00:19:20,07
The French person or a French person that German or whatever sales letter

126
00:19:20,76 --> 00:19:25,2
and they had been you continue with their different cultures and health

127
00:19:25,2 --> 00:19:35,12
but they were all just bundled in the melting pot as they can adjust men.

128
00:19:35,12 --> 00:19:40,12
They are throughout the strong objection taken to the word, and although it is still used today,

129
00:19:40,12 --> 00:19:48,23
particularly by historians anthropologist 's bad turn my father objected to it very strongly.

130
00:19:48,23 --> 00:19:58,66
Yesterday I come from aim is my highlight it is not to am a it's not down any injury at Pentecost in India,

131
00:19:58,66 --> 00:20:00,44
and were different,

132
00:20:00,44 --> 00:20:12,03
so of course in many ways they were forced to lose their identity are so he ended his brother having

133
00:20:12,03 --> 00:20:24,64
and their sister Kate spent twenty years working after some years they were paid that paid very, very little.

134
00:20:24,64 --> 00:20:33,48
It's true they had their own way of an entertaining themselves are negative work on a Sunday

135
00:20:33,48 --> 00:20:40,55
and the farmers always organised as a Christian to give them some lessons in Christ

136
00:20:41,78 --> 00:20:47,64
and it is all a bit of a mystery to my father because he says it

137
00:20:47,64 --> 00:20:58,26
and believe it if I can't walk on water lather cameraman Jesus Walker brought the more you just being very practical

138
00:20:58,26 --> 00:21:03,83
anyhow, they were always expected to lead to church

139
00:21:04,19 --> 00:21:11,95
and they went to church because that provided them with a very good opportunity of coming together in seeing each other

140
00:21:11,95 --> 00:21:20,87
but couldn't it during the week to target exhausted they have to sleep some days they go to church because that's what

141
00:21:20,87 --> 00:21:30,09
it was a mapping together are some of them were able to play the piano accordion they look great at that

142
00:21:30,09 --> 00:21:42,36
and the little small following a ball and paint play by year, mainly in the city absolutely loved it.

143
00:21:42,36 --> 00:21:44,3
That was carried on ropes enough.

144
00:21:44,3 --> 00:21:49,71
I was a sad debating just in the church

145
00:21:49,71 --> 00:21:56,93
or to the season at other times as well well… usually put that the service was often held under a big mango tree

146
00:21:57,8 --> 00:22:10,2
and they have made in the church, but they are before or after you now this is a feast day or so

147
00:22:10,2 --> 00:22:20,6
and have been cooked left much more toe for something a little special tell me the story of how your father left these

148
00:22:20,6 --> 00:22:22,09
conditions.

149
00:22:22,09 --> 00:22:31,02
He was twenty years in Mackay probity get out when it had a gut full of all of this after a while,

150
00:22:31,02 --> 00:22:39,66
and there he wanted her money, you really be able to buy beds, chairs and whatever,

151
00:22:39,66 --> 00:22:47,83
like the extent that they are not quite sure whether her his brother, my uncle Charles

152
00:22:47,83 --> 00:22:50,9
and auntie Kate gathered up the goods and shackles

153
00:22:50,9 --> 00:22:56,85
and went together with him whether I think he went to learn the estimate went a little later

154
00:22:56,85 --> 00:23:07,01
and don't so he learned he ran away year one and he only travel during the night

155
00:23:07,01 --> 00:23:12,6
and during the dateline in the bushes doesn't sleep mailing staff

156
00:23:13,73 --> 00:23:25,12
and he did that from a kite in Brisbane because he didn't want to be seen yesterday at the he the many beautiful stream

157
00:23:25,12 --> 00:23:26,57
was by the roadside.

158
00:23:26,57 --> 00:23:36,85
The unmade roads streams from the mountains you could thought it was clear crystal just beautiful

159
00:23:36,85 --> 00:23:47,07
and down at he had fought and varies of all kinds probably not dead brown bandicoot or Paddy Mallon, or something

160
00:23:47,72 --> 00:23:55,52
and he did take on matters and things with him so he was able to feed himself on the way down

161
00:23:55,52 --> 00:24:05,02
and data guess he read it affirmative bananas or whatever was going and eventually here who arrived in Brisbane.

162
00:24:05,02 --> 00:24:06,44
Well,

163
00:24:06,44 --> 00:24:17,15
he'd always heard about Brisbane while he was still in McCartney discrete city in the staff while he was still in the

164
00:24:17,15 --> 00:24:24,59
car he had observed of my auntie Kate is to do the house should be to add a few clues about running a house that

165
00:24:24,59 --> 00:24:29,2
when he got to Brisbane to hear.

166
00:24:29,2 --> 00:24:35,58
He went and got a job in a house for a woman who left all alone

167
00:24:35,58 --> 00:24:41,47
and she paid him she had to listen very welcome common

168
00:24:41,83 --> 00:24:52,72
and festival she employed him as the gardener in the suburb of what it is wanted was the Albion then which adjoins

169
00:24:52,72 --> 00:24:53,53
Clayfield.

170
00:24:53,53 --> 00:24:59,32
This is very harsh in the anyhow, he started off with the garden

171
00:25:00,35 --> 00:25:04,65
and then he said she got him to do the floors of the house

172
00:25:04,65 --> 00:25:12,04
and he really enjoyed that isn't carried wrap the line on delinquencies faith in our

173
00:25:14,16 --> 00:25:21,57
and then the she started to show palatable in an EA and if you think the fat

174
00:25:21,57 --> 00:25:30,86
and in any he was doing everything for her everything all cooking gardens shopping the extruding about it.

175
00:25:30,86 --> 00:25:34,01
He told us that she only had one drink

176
00:25:34,01 --> 00:25:43,87
and it was his job to wash that drink every evening after he served firmly in cheek

177
00:25:43,87 --> 00:25:50,15
and get into had nothing down the dressing gown and he'd take that dread and is doing very,

178
00:25:50,15 --> 00:25:56,89
very hard that would dry overnight and he would find it in the morning it given to her in.

179
00:25:56,89 --> 00:26:10,57
She put it on wealthier will I shall effect/ eighty there and then receive the promises I want system hard with you

180
00:26:10,57 --> 00:26:26,04
and really work there. He left Brisbane and then hit it off to walk to cross the Queensland border.

181
00:26:26,04 --> 00:26:29,14
That's a hundred miles was at fifty.

182
00:26:29,14 --> 00:26:40,22
Anyhow it was peanuts to him absolutely nothing great tall stroll of thirty -year-old that took at any strike he

183
00:26:40,22 --> 00:26:53,83
arrived at journos versus Canada is an very found quite a few morale and and do so they all together very quickly.

00:26:53,83 --> 00:27:09,82
He meant the whose parents were from Sweden and she was a place with the island as she do things on washing, cooking

185
00:27:09,82 --> 00:27:19,74
or whatever. This was that surfers Paradise. She was a very tightly little person.

186
00:27:19,74 --> 00:27:24,81
She wasn't a warm and she was only ago and she didn't seem to belong to anyone.

187
00:27:24,81 --> 00:27:32,41
No parent is no family learnt nothing so now my father felt very sorry for her

188
00:27:32,99 --> 00:27:39,59
but he said he couldn't stay there he wanted to go to a place where he could get a farm of his own,

189
00:27:39,59 --> 00:27:53,3
so he walked away from surfers Paradise went down across the border is killing at walked through twenty ten out through

192
00:28:08,05 --> 00:28:16,62
white farmers receipts and very, very quickly. He got pensions settled in Lauer.

I want activists woman to whom he may in certain spirit after a short while this woman appear and could you

194
00:28:28,81 --> 00:28:30,23

She then brought by some other Ireland women who were moving over to we could,

you could was now had a reputation among the islanders that was a good place to settle and it was nice

197
00:28:44,32 --> 00:28:55,85
and the farmers were good and they paid a decent wage so the woman came in couldn't she had nothing

198
00:28:56,16 --> 00:29:03,81
and someone saw her she was only about fourteen or fifteen feet and some sort, and they took to the police station

199
00:29:05,27 --> 00:29:12,8
and one of my father 's country went into the police station for something or another, and the police daily.

200
00:29:12,8 --> 00:29:22,68
This manager is to know anybody get out of her into pieces of what we don't what to do with her.
