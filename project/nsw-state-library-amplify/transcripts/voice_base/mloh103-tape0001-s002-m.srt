1
00:00:15,87 --> 00:00:20,94
We come to nimbin for peace and happiness
and harmony in our lives and the way

2
00:00:20,94 --> 00:00:26,04
that we divided the labor in those
early days of building our homes

3
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:32,37
and establishing gardens was really
directed towards peace and harmony.

4
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:34,22
The difficulties

5
00:00:34,22 --> 00:00:38,25
that would have ensued from say doing it
the other way around having the women out

6
00:00:38,25 --> 00:00:40,98
trying to build the house and the
men inside looking out of the kids

7
00:00:41,76 --> 00:00:44,64
that would not have been
a harmonious situation.

8
00:00:44,66 --> 00:00:49,57
This didn't in any way allay the
deep suspicion of the city feminists

9
00:00:49,57 --> 00:00:52,51
that we just fallen for
the old line and you know

10
00:00:52,51 --> 00:00:56,32
that we were really not creating
any sort of alternative at all

11
00:00:57,93 --> 00:01:01,89
but from our point of view it was a more
harmonious way of living our lives.

12
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:05,00
I think i can't speak for all
my sisters in that regard

13
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:09,40
but certainly for me
it didn't feel too bad

14
00:01:09,40 --> 00:01:13,18
and i did have a go at clearing a
site and starting to build something

15
00:01:14,43 --> 00:01:19,98
and within a very short space of time i was
weeping over the mattock i do you know

16
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:21,71
just feeling totally incompetent.

17
00:01:22,04 --> 00:01:25,39
Now there were women who
who have built houses

18
00:01:25,39 --> 00:01:29,52
and one woman built a stone
house at the top of a cliff.

19
00:01:30,90 --> 00:01:32,91
From stone that she had
to get up there somehow.

20
00:01:33,04 --> 00:01:38,86
And she devised a flying fox too to
carry the materials up to the site an

21
00:01:38,87 --> 00:01:44,10
extraordinary feat of engineering
and another woman. Not only built.

22
00:01:44,62 --> 00:01:46,35
I think by now she's built several houses

23
00:01:46,35 --> 00:01:50,85
but in the in the early time of paradise
valley she built her first home

24
00:01:52,07 --> 00:01:56,87
and subsequently went on to teach other
women in a women's building course and

25
00:01:56,87 --> 00:02:00,19
and also taught aboriginal
women in a built. In course.

26
00:02:00,55 --> 00:02:02,36
So that's not to say

27
00:02:02,36 --> 00:02:06,83
that you know there weren't women who
became builders there were quite a few

28
00:02:08,98 --> 00:02:11,95
but as i say in the early days it
was it was mainly the men who did

29
00:02:11,95 --> 00:02:16,41
that sort of work and mostly
that was that was okay.

30
00:02:17,71 --> 00:02:20,48
There were ways in which of
course you know i mean the guys

31
00:02:20,48 --> 00:02:22,97
that came to live it turned
toward just guys you know

32
00:02:22,97 --> 00:02:25,63
and the women were just women and
we all came with the conditioning

33
00:02:25,63 --> 00:02:28,40
that we'd all had no different
from the rest of society

34
00:02:29,27 --> 00:02:33,04
but with the haps a little more
will to move past our conditioning

35
00:02:33,04 --> 00:02:38,05
and establish a new values
and customs for ourselves so

36
00:02:38,06 --> 00:02:41,04
that the aim of

37
00:02:41,04 --> 00:02:44,46
that was really to help each other rather
than to confront each other constantly

38
00:02:44,46 --> 00:02:51,34
which would have just been a constant
battle. I think we were aiming for.

39
00:02:51,50 --> 00:02:55,78
How can we co-operate how can
we live together better.

40
00:02:55,80 --> 00:02:59,69
And there were many ways in
which we tried to achieve that.

41
00:02:59,79 --> 00:03:06,77
No women's group was particularly supportive
of women you know who either wanted in

42
00:03:06,78 --> 00:03:11,26
their relationship to improve
their status as women.

43
00:03:11,28 --> 00:03:12,31
Or who felt

44
00:03:12,31 --> 00:03:16,14
that their status was so far from any
hope of improvement in the relationship

45
00:03:16,14 --> 00:03:20,28
that they were in that they were
supported then to get out of

46
00:03:20,28 --> 00:03:23,22
that relationship because it was seen
as being destructive and harmful

47
00:03:23,93 --> 00:03:24,78
and i guess for that reason

48
00:03:24,78 --> 00:03:29,60
and also a lot of relationships
actually didn't survive.

49
00:03:30,56 --> 00:03:31,90
And i do think that

50
00:03:31,90 --> 00:03:36,41
that was partly because women were
supported to leave relationships

51
00:03:36,41 --> 00:03:43,01
that was stifling them. Yeah very much.

52
00:03:43,06 --> 00:03:45,93
So although it was a factor too.

53
00:03:46,13 --> 00:03:50,38
In you'd think twice before leaving any
sort of a shelter because there wasn't

54
00:03:50,38 --> 00:03:54,76
another one to go to easily and.

55
00:03:54,78 --> 00:03:58,50
But because i suppose there were very
few women and quite a lot of guys

56
00:03:58,50 --> 00:03:59,84
and probably about three to.

57
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,90
One in the first few years of tangible
it was a little easier for women to find

58
00:04:06,90 --> 00:04:08,40
support not only among her women friends

59
00:04:08,40 --> 00:04:11,99
but also from other guys
outside of her relationship.

60
00:04:12,01 --> 00:04:15,82
And it didn't work the other way and

61
00:04:15,83 --> 00:04:20,86
that led to an awful lot of loneliness
particularly among the guys who were there

62
00:04:20,86 --> 00:04:23,40
without partners and

63
00:04:24,88 --> 00:04:27,35
and really belied the myth

64
00:04:27,35 --> 00:04:31,77
that the nimbin alternative society
was about sex drugs and rock

65
00:04:31,77 --> 00:04:35,64
and roll because it was not as much about
sex as people might have supposed the

66
00:04:35,65 --> 00:04:41,04
fact that we all ran around start naked
which we did had nothing to do with that.

67
00:04:41,32 --> 00:04:45,73
Well certainly you know as far as i was
concerned it didn't it may have in the

68
00:04:45,73 --> 00:04:48,53
minds of some people but. It really.

69
00:04:50,47 --> 00:04:54,63
In a way there was a kind of incest
taboo operating where we were so close

70
00:04:54,63 --> 00:04:58,93
and living together and
such close quarters that.

71
00:04:58,95 --> 00:05:03,82
To run through a series of highly charged
sexual relationships with one's.

72
00:05:04,12 --> 00:05:04,59
Brothers

73
00:05:04,59 --> 00:05:09,58
and sisters could have actually been
destructive to the to the survival of the

74
00:05:09,58 --> 00:05:14,47
community and you know i don't know how
conscious that was but i observed that

75
00:05:15,23 --> 00:05:15,99
that it didn't happen

76
00:05:15,99 --> 00:05:19,64
that there weren't a series of
highly charged sexual relationships

77
00:05:19,64 --> 00:05:22,00
that one relationship
might be breaking down

78
00:05:22,00 --> 00:05:26,83
and another one might be
passionately starting up but.

79
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:31,20
It was it wasn't right through the
community or you know sort of.

80
00:05:32,63 --> 00:05:34,91
A total sort of day night loving as.

81
00:05:35,41 --> 00:05:39,13
The media might have like to
portray it despite the fact

82
00:05:39,13 --> 00:05:43,17
that we never had any clothes on.

83
00:05:43,92 --> 00:05:55,56
It.

84
00:05:57,34 --> 00:05:59,40
Very much so and in fact i think.

85
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,89
Had it not been for my tribal experience
of nimbin i may not have gone on to

86
00:06:06,89 --> 00:06:10,14
be as interested in other
tribal cultures as i am but.

87
00:06:10,18 --> 00:06:14,79
Subsequently i spent a great deal of time
with the rainforest tried since are awake

88
00:06:14,79 --> 00:06:17,01
in borneo.

89
00:06:17,02 --> 00:06:19,83
And particularly with the
penan and chi and tribes

90
00:06:19,83 --> 00:06:25,02
and their ways of living exhibit often.

91
00:06:25,19 --> 00:06:27,53
Well very much the same sort of qualities

92
00:06:27,53 --> 00:06:30,48
and i've noticed also with
some aboriginal tribal people

93
00:06:30,48 --> 00:06:34,26
and north american indians too.

94
00:06:35,06 --> 00:06:39,65
That probably the most important things is
is if everybody's at a similar level of

95
00:06:39,65 --> 00:06:39,97
poverty.

96
00:06:41,23 --> 00:06:46,00
It's not really first was not really
experience just poverty then it's anything

97
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:51,98
that is extra to do your very
basic provisions is is a treat

98
00:06:51,98 --> 00:06:53,95
and everybody is really excited about that

99
00:06:53,95 --> 00:07:00,17
but also you share anything if everyone's
really poor you share anything with

100
00:07:00,17 --> 00:07:05,63
anyone. There's no that smart and
you can't have it sort of feeling

101
00:07:05,63 --> 00:07:08,23
and that's true throughout
tribal societies

102
00:07:08,23 --> 00:07:13,74
and it's more true in truly tribal societies
than it was at nimbin in those days

103
00:07:13,74 --> 00:07:15,57
but there were elements of that there

104
00:07:16,45 --> 00:07:20,85
that you know there was there would
always be a welcome and refreshments

105
00:07:20,85 --> 00:07:26,80
and you know hospitality even for
total strangers who arrived at tunde

106
00:07:26,80 --> 00:07:30,26
or that somewhere they'd
always find a warm welcome

107
00:07:30,26 --> 00:07:33,10
and a sense of community
as soon as they got there

108
00:07:33,96 --> 00:07:40,18
and that's that's a very tribal
thing and a kind of integrity and.

109
00:07:41,19 --> 00:07:45,97
A trust a lack of a
stranger feeling you know

110
00:07:45,97 --> 00:07:48,46
that you're a stranger
somebody else is a stranger.

111
00:07:48,47 --> 00:07:50,27
There's a kind of there's more openness

112
00:07:50,27 --> 00:07:54,73
and trust accepting people exactly
as you find them at that moment

113
00:07:55,52 --> 00:07:59,77
and not sort of projecting a whole
lot of fear or suspicion onto them.

114
00:08:00,91 --> 00:08:03,05
And that tended to be you know.

115
00:08:03,42 --> 00:08:07,51
The way that we operated it
for that everyone was okay

116
00:08:08,35 --> 00:08:09,95
and if they prove
themselves to be otherwise.

117
00:08:10,18 --> 00:08:13,27
Well we just knew more
about them than you know

118
00:08:14,44 --> 00:08:17,62
and i think that's that's a
fairly tribal sort of thing.

119
00:08:18,95 --> 00:08:25,68
And despite what i said earlier about
the ways of bringing up children still

120
00:08:25,69 --> 00:08:30,95
within the tribal setting there were more
advantages for children than disadvantage

121
00:08:30,95 --> 00:08:33,99
is that the tribal way of
bringing up children in the sense

122
00:08:33,99 --> 00:08:38,75
that adults would have a sense of
responsibility as much for other people's

123
00:08:38,75 --> 00:08:41,07
children as for their own now

124
00:08:41,08 --> 00:08:44,47
that might have come back to
a lowest common denominator

125
00:08:44,47 --> 00:08:47,27
that they didn't have much sense of
responsibility for anyone children

126
00:08:47,27 --> 00:08:50,14
but the children all survived i mean none
of them actually sort of drowned in the

127
00:08:50,14 --> 00:08:51,42
creek.

128
00:08:52,39 --> 00:08:56,66
So there was a sense that there
were other eyes and ears and uncles

129
00:08:56,66 --> 00:09:00,22
and aunties out there and if
you kids were in difficulty

130
00:09:00,22 --> 00:09:03,76
that there be somebody they could
call on even if you weren't nearby.

131
00:09:04,98 --> 00:09:09,32
That was a good feeling and a
tribal feeling but i think mostly

132
00:09:09,32 --> 00:09:12,55
that the sense of a tribal experience came

133
00:09:12,55 --> 00:09:15,75
when we came together for
celebrations and dances

134
00:09:15,75 --> 00:09:22,45
and events could have been an event centered
around a spiritual activity such as

135
00:09:22,45 --> 00:09:28,19
a naming ceremony for children or a
retreat or something of that sort

136
00:09:28,19 --> 00:09:33,04
or it could have been just a full moon dance
at luna paul could have been anything

137
00:09:33,04 --> 00:09:34,35
but when we all came together

138
00:09:35,83 --> 00:09:41,35
and saw each other there in you know
dressed in whatever we're dressed in silks

139
00:09:41,35 --> 00:09:45,68
and satins and colors and all that
sort of stuff in celebre tree mood.

140
00:09:45,70 --> 00:09:49,41
Then the tribal sense was
exquisite just exquisite

141
00:09:49,41 --> 00:09:54,04
and it's still it's still survives now
even they were scattered through the hills

142
00:09:54,04 --> 00:09:59,81
and the rainbow region is extended far
beyond the boundaries of nimbin. When we do.

143
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,60
See each other at different events
maybe at byron bay or even in sydney

144
00:10:03,60 --> 00:10:09,27
or somewhere else that sense of oh we're
together again is really wonderful

145
00:10:10,10 --> 00:10:14,65
and now it's interesting because we often
i find with lots of different people.

146
00:10:14,85 --> 00:10:18,87
We sort of make jokes about how we're all
going to end up in the same old hippies

147
00:10:18,87 --> 00:10:24,67
home somewhere and i mean that it's a
joke now because we're in our mid forties

148
00:10:24,67 --> 00:10:28,93
but actually 20 years down the track if we
keep meeting like this you know you know

149
00:10:28,93 --> 00:10:32,04
what's going to happen
and it could well be

150
00:10:32,04 --> 00:10:36,58
that there's a suddenly wonderful
eccentric old hippies home

151
00:10:36,58 --> 00:10:38,12
and there's a part of me

152
00:10:38,12 --> 00:10:45,67
that really hopes there will be i
think these they're just sort of.

153
00:10:46,59 --> 00:10:48,83
You know.

154
00:10:48,85 --> 00:10:53,77
Well the folk love was one of the very
earliest sort of institutions of nimbin i

155
00:10:53,77 --> 00:10:57,76
mean there were many and and many
have survived to the present day

156
00:10:57,76 --> 00:11:01,87
but the folklore was
particularly special because.

157
00:11:01,89 --> 00:11:08,11
There were so many people who came who
had music as part of their background

158
00:11:08,12 --> 00:11:13,40
and one of the things that they really
loved to do either is a you know.

159
00:11:13,42 --> 00:11:14,82
A player or a listener.

160
00:11:15,50 --> 00:11:20,22
And the folk club arose out of that
and arose also out of the fact

161
00:11:20,22 --> 00:11:23,18
that a number of those people they
might have had classical training

162
00:11:23,18 --> 00:11:24,89
or all sorts of training

163
00:11:24,89 --> 00:11:30,53
and education in music a lot of them
were into writing original material

164
00:11:31,61 --> 00:11:37,04
and which is not particularly commercial
perhaps but incredibly enjoyable

165
00:11:38,12 --> 00:11:43,72
and so we had a weekly event where
you know it was just a kind of

166
00:11:45,05 --> 00:11:50,28
jam session or you know people would would
play one at a time or into us or trios

167
00:11:50,28 --> 00:11:54,19
or whatever and then all get together
at the end for whatever happened

168
00:11:54,19 --> 00:11:57,53
and it was it was an extraordinary event

169
00:11:57,53 --> 00:12:00,21
and every time it happened
i mean sometimes. It was.

170
00:12:01,28 --> 00:12:03,21
The most astonishing music you know

171
00:12:03,21 --> 00:12:07,24
and people you got to be very famous we
had people who sort of had played the

172
00:12:07,24 --> 00:12:07,89
sydney opera house.

173
00:12:08,93 --> 00:12:14,15
You know playing unbelievably strange
medieval instruments you know the night

174
00:12:14,15 --> 00:12:18,63
before and the next night found themselves
in nimbin playing to an indian crowd

175
00:12:18,63 --> 00:12:22,48
and getting you know an even more motorists
ponce in the night got at the opera

176
00:12:24,21 --> 00:12:29,78
and we didn't we had a magic drawing power
for all sorts of people who came through

177
00:12:29,78 --> 00:12:33,76
and one of the most healing events
for nimbin in the early days

178
00:12:34,89 --> 00:12:37,97
when there was still
quite a bit of suspicion

179
00:12:37,97 --> 00:12:41,65
and difficulty between the old settlers
and the new people who'd come to town

180
00:12:43,07 --> 00:12:48,53
and slim dusty was in town and was
invited to play at the folk and

181
00:12:48,53 --> 00:12:50,16
and agreed to do that

182
00:12:51,74 --> 00:12:57,18
and it was just fantastic because he was
the hero of all the country people who

183
00:12:57,18 --> 00:12:58,03
live there for ever

184
00:12:59,14 --> 00:13:03,13
and you know particularly the sort of
middle aged country women who lived in a

185
00:13:03,13 --> 00:13:05,29
minute that time you know just do it.

186
00:13:05,30 --> 00:13:11,34
Him they were absolutely ecstatic slim dusty
fans quite unashamedly you know really

187
00:13:11,34 --> 00:13:18,02
amazing. And and we organised a night
where half of it was slim dusty

188
00:13:18,02 --> 00:13:20,66
and his daughter anka
patrick and their band

189
00:13:21,87 --> 00:13:25,18
and putting on a fantastic totally
professional show for nothing.

190
00:13:25,18 --> 00:13:30,92
You know and the rest of it was an info
club singers and the best of performance

191
00:13:30,92 --> 00:13:31,41
and.

192
00:13:32,03 --> 00:13:38,02
Who organised some special material for
the night to to really share with the old

193
00:13:38,02 --> 00:13:41,16
settlers what it was that brings
us together and keeps us together

194
00:13:41,16 --> 00:13:43,70
and to let them have a glimpse
of that and let them know

195
00:13:43,70 --> 00:13:47,42
that they were welcome to
share in it too. Any time.

196
00:13:47,44 --> 00:13:52,35
And it was just the most wonderfully
successful night. Everyone had a great time.

197
00:13:52,54 --> 00:13:56,02
The old settlers of course loved
slim dusty and were you know.

198
00:13:56,05 --> 00:13:59,75
Felt so wonderful to have him in
their town playing for them but.

199
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:04,68
Also really enjoyed that little peek into
what the hippies like to do you know

200
00:14:04,68 --> 00:14:07,32
when they get in there on tuesday
nights and have their folk love

201
00:14:07,32 --> 00:14:12,31
and you know they've never ventured
in before and to tell the truth.

202
00:14:12,34 --> 00:14:16,55
They didn't venture in much after either
but it was they knew a bit more about us.

203
00:14:16,56 --> 00:14:17,03
After that

204
00:14:17,75 --> 00:14:24,25
and we'd had a a common shared high
experience which amongst ourselves we were

205
00:14:24,25 --> 00:14:25,91
having all the time really regularly

206
00:14:25,91 --> 00:14:30,06
but with the people who lived here
before we came we seldom got to have

207
00:14:30,06 --> 00:14:33,84
that sort of commonality
of a high experience

208
00:14:33,84 --> 00:14:36,39
that we could look back on together
and say wasn't that a great night

209
00:14:37,36 --> 00:14:53,14
and it was lovely to have
one of those very special.

210
00:14:54,69 --> 00:15:00,02
I never had any yeah i personally
never had any direct experience of

211
00:15:01,01 --> 00:15:04,99
hostility from sickos who'd
been there before i came

212
00:15:05,88 --> 00:15:09,17
but i heard of many people who did and
i was it was the nearest i got was

213
00:15:09,17 --> 00:15:13,23
when somebody i was at the bush factory
one night and there was music on

214
00:15:13,23 --> 00:15:15,72
and a neighbor complained
very loudly about the noise

215
00:15:15,72 --> 00:15:18,37
and she obviously hated
everything about us.

216
00:15:18,42 --> 00:15:22,46
It wasn't just the noise
at the factory that night.

217
00:15:22,47 --> 00:15:25,76
Yes i did hear stories of
people being shot at it

218
00:15:25,76 --> 00:15:29,44
when they were seen sort of diving into
some of these creek with no clothes on

219
00:15:29,44 --> 00:15:35,71
and they were you know i mean it was a
period of adjustment in the first five to

220
00:15:35,71 --> 00:15:37,86
eight years of living their lives.

221
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:39,55
You know understanding

222
00:15:39,55 --> 00:15:43,16
that maybe it was offensive to other
people if we took our close off

223
00:15:43,16 --> 00:15:44,27
and jumped in their creek.

224
00:15:44,44 --> 00:15:49,86
You know and maybe we should think
about that and refrain. You know.

225
00:15:49,88 --> 00:15:54,29
And the same time you know it was
offensive to us to see them lift a gun

226
00:15:54,29 --> 00:15:56,78
and shoot at anything
you know especially us.

227
00:15:57,01 --> 00:16:01,35
But you know even a bird or a rabbit a
lot. If people would have been very upset.

228
00:16:02,46 --> 00:16:05,35
So you know i mean we just
had lifestyle differences

229
00:16:05,35 --> 00:16:06,71
that were bound to bring some friction

230
00:16:06,71 --> 00:16:10,74
but given the number of
those lifestyle differences

231
00:16:10,74 --> 00:16:16,86
and the tenacity of people on both sides
to their particular way of life in some

232
00:16:16,86 --> 00:16:20,59
cases it's surprising that there
wasn't more friction and there was

233
00:16:20,59 --> 00:16:23,25
and i always feel like
you know looking back on

234
00:16:23,25 --> 00:16:30,24
that applauding the old settlers for
their example of tolerance which i think

235
00:16:30,24 --> 00:16:31,79
taught us a great deal and

236
00:16:32,73 --> 00:16:39,20
when the time came for us to see a third
wave of settlers coming to nimbin who had

237
00:16:39,20 --> 00:16:44,51
different ideals and look different and
acted differently from how we had.

238
00:16:44,53 --> 00:16:48,47
We were very hard put to it
to show as much tolerance

239
00:16:48,47 --> 00:16:51,79
and compassion as the
original settlers have been

240
00:16:51,79 --> 00:17:06,85
when we are rived on their doorstep.

241
00:17:06,86 --> 00:17:12,76
Here the study was i didn't study for the
university of new england i think as the

242
00:17:13,70 --> 00:17:18,60
geography department. It
was a land use survey and.

243
00:17:18,61 --> 00:17:24,84
The intention was to find out the shifting
patterns of land use in various parts of

244
00:17:24,84 --> 00:17:27,51
new south wales i think they had
a control area somewhere else.

245
00:17:29,10 --> 00:17:32,93
And they were particularly interested in
interviewing the new settlers to nimbin

246
00:17:32,93 --> 00:17:35,07
and and finding out what they were about

247
00:17:35,07 --> 00:17:38,70
and how what their intentions were as
regard the regards the use of the land.

248
00:17:40,02 --> 00:17:42,91
Well i don't remember very much about
what they replied in answer to

249
00:17:42,91 --> 00:17:44,84
that particular question
or that set of questions

250
00:17:44,84 --> 00:17:48,43
but what really struck
me is quite remarkable.

251
00:17:50,21 --> 00:17:52,73
Was that one of the questions that i ask.

252
00:17:52,73 --> 00:17:56,36
I had to interview i
think it was 94 hippies.

253
00:17:56,38 --> 00:17:59,61
Which wasn't hard to do it
was actually a lot of fun.

254
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,58
And one of the questions
that i asked them all was.

255
00:18:03,60 --> 00:18:10,04
Whether they felt themselves in coming
to nimbin. To be a part of a movement.

256
00:18:10,06 --> 00:18:14,23
And i mean objectively you know if you
took a step back and looked at it.

257
00:18:14,30 --> 00:18:19,92
Who were 94 people representing another
you know several hundred who'd all come

258
00:18:19,92 --> 00:18:23,98
around the same period of time
to the same area doing more

259
00:18:23,98 --> 00:18:26,83
or less the same sorts of
things in similar ways

260
00:18:28,22 --> 00:18:32,64
and you know from an objective point of
view movement wouldn't be too strong a word

261
00:18:32,64 --> 00:18:36,75
to put on it but every one of them said
i'm not i'm not part of a movement.

262
00:18:36,93 --> 00:18:41,71
I'm an individual who like it was
completely separate from anything else

263
00:18:41,71 --> 00:18:45,75
that was happening and i found that quite
astonishing but it was actually true.

264
00:18:45,81 --> 00:18:48,85
I mean people believed that
of themselves they felt.

265
00:18:48,87 --> 00:18:54,34
They not only fat they really experienced
themselves as making a totally individual

266
00:18:54,34 --> 00:18:58,16
choice and coming to nimbin and
doing a totally individual thing.

267
00:18:59,22 --> 00:19:04,66
And i love the duology of that
that of course it was a movement

268
00:19:04,66 --> 00:19:09,53
and of course it was nothing to do with a
movement it was a you know hundreds of

269
00:19:09,53 --> 00:19:11,05
totally individual decisions.

270
00:19:11,86 --> 00:19:14,17
I think that really a pit in
my eyes is a lot about women

271
00:19:14,17 --> 00:19:16,39
and it says a lot about the difficulties

272
00:19:16,39 --> 00:19:19,62
that we always had in making
rules for communities. You know.

273
00:19:19,98 --> 00:19:25,41
Until falls coordination co-operative at
its very first tribal meeting brought up

274
00:19:25,41 --> 00:19:28,46
the topic of whether people should
be allowed to have cats dogs

275
00:19:28,46 --> 00:19:32,64
and guns on the property
and now 15 years later

276
00:19:32,64 --> 00:19:38,46
and more than 58 in nearly 20 years later
they're still discussing whether they can

277
00:19:38,46 --> 00:19:40,63
have cats dogs and guns
on the property and now

278
00:19:40,63 --> 00:19:44,11
and all the intervening years there
have been cats and dogs and guns

279
00:19:44,11 --> 00:19:48,12
and everybody's disapproved of it and
everybody's tried to make rules about it

280
00:19:48,12 --> 00:19:54,29
and it can't happen. And so where
there are levels of agreement.

281
00:19:54,33 --> 00:19:59,07
I think they're usually quite
unspoken and unconscious and.

282
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,92
Deviance from the general agreement
in terms of environmental

283
00:20:05,93 --> 00:20:10,31
custodianship and those sorts of concepts

284
00:20:11,08 --> 00:20:17,59
that are beyond rules. You know.

285
00:20:17,76 --> 00:20:23,70
No i don't because i feel in a way
it's success because rigid rules

286
00:20:25,07 --> 00:20:28,62
actively exclude the people
who will not conform to them

287
00:20:29,58 --> 00:20:35,92
and in a society of non-conformists how
how could you possibly impose rigid rules

288
00:20:35,92 --> 00:20:45,62
and not lose some of your best people.

289
00:20:48,04 --> 00:20:54,90
It was about being active
being creative being careful

290
00:20:54,90 --> 00:20:56,29
and being harmless

291
00:20:58,48 --> 00:21:03,05
and it was also about growing ourselves.

292
00:21:04,39 --> 00:21:07,07
Food children.

293
00:21:07,08 --> 00:21:12,12
Institutions structures that we needed
that were appropriate to our needs.

294
00:21:13,64 --> 00:21:16,97
But growing all those things and
taking care of those things

295
00:21:16,97 --> 00:21:21,39
and as much as we could
of the wider picture too.

296
00:21:23,29 --> 00:21:25,67
And giving something into it.

297
00:21:26,00 --> 00:21:32,81
Putting own mark into it somehow
culturally so that involved music

298
00:21:32,81 --> 00:21:36,90
and dance and poetry and all sorts of art

299
00:21:39,12 --> 00:21:46,05
and. I suppose treading lightly on the
earth and and above all being harmless.

300
00:21:47,08 --> 00:21:47,83
That's what it was for me

301
00:21:47,83 --> 00:21:59,44
but you know they've be as many
visions as there are people here.

302
00:22:00,85 --> 00:22:03,41
But he needs to.

303
00:22:06,79 --> 00:22:13,12
Guys give it a serious.

304
00:22:13,13 --> 00:22:16,29
Oh there's been so many stupid hippy ideas

305
00:22:16,29 --> 00:22:22,04
and long hippy raves deep into
the night about to technology

306
00:22:22,05 --> 00:22:26,50
and it's really hard to even think of
one example they are all so bizarre.

307
00:22:29,86 --> 00:22:35,67
So bizarre that i can't i
can't come up with air

308
00:22:35,67 --> 00:22:42,61
and. Well actually i mean in terms of
conspiracy theories that that that it.

309
00:22:42,68 --> 00:22:45,73
There's been quite a frightening
thing about an imminent a way that

310
00:22:45,73 --> 00:22:50,61
that there's a lot of paranoia
around and i don't know

311
00:22:50,61 --> 00:22:51,66
that i really want to go into

312
00:22:51,66 --> 00:22:56,39
that there because it's a i suppose only
a few individuals. So it's not a good.

313
00:22:56,53 --> 00:23:01,45
It's not a good starting
at the end to go into

314
00:23:01,45 --> 00:23:05,04
that.

315
00:23:06,22 --> 00:23:16,53
Problem.

316
00:23:17,81 --> 00:23:23,15
Yeah i think that's why i really didn't
want to go into it because there are there

317
00:23:23,15 --> 00:23:26,66
are some people around them in who
will be thought disordered with

318
00:23:26,66 --> 00:23:30,75
or without marijuana who are actually
you know borderline personalities

319
00:23:30,75 --> 00:23:34,38
and that's really harry's area
more than mine. It's not a good.

320
00:23:34,52 --> 00:23:45,35
It's not a good thing for me to talk
about yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

321
00:23:45,36 --> 00:23:46,70
Kids names.

322
00:23:49,10 --> 00:23:57,92
What people.

323
00:23:58,63 --> 00:23:59,90
Yeah yeah.

324
00:24:00,18 --> 00:24:04,20
Well people you people gave
their children the names

325
00:24:04,20 --> 00:24:07,33
that people gave to their children were
actually no funnier than the names

326
00:24:07,33 --> 00:24:08,49
that they gave to themselves.

327
00:24:08,65 --> 00:24:13,69
I mean you know there were as many
sort of staff flowers and sundays

328
00:24:13,70 --> 00:24:19,90
and moon shines in among the adult population
who changed their names as there were

329
00:24:20,70 --> 00:24:23,59
strange and unusual
names for the children.

330
00:24:23,60 --> 00:24:25,65
And of course particularly

331
00:24:26,55 --> 00:24:30,73
when quite a few people became devotees
of racial nation and that's not to say

332
00:24:30,73 --> 00:24:33,68
that that was any kind of dominant
paradigm in the community

333
00:24:33,68 --> 00:24:36,92
but quite a few people did
get into the rajneesh eating

334
00:24:36,92 --> 00:24:41,57
and take on new names as a result of
that there was impossible to remember

335
00:24:41,57 --> 00:24:43,61
and far too long and irrelevant.

336
00:24:43,70 --> 00:24:47,49
But that's a judgment of mine but the nays

337
00:24:47,49 --> 00:24:51,29
that were given to children because
a lot of the children wouldn't.

338
00:24:51,31 --> 00:24:57,71
Wouldn't keep they once they got to school
age if the name embarrassed them the

339
00:24:57,71 --> 00:24:58,70
child would change it.

340
00:24:59,69 --> 00:25:05,98
I was there was a there was a child called
tiger who pretty quickly reverted to

341
00:25:05,98 --> 00:25:10,54
sally when she got to school and
there was another little guy.

342
00:25:10,70 --> 00:25:13,01
I forget what his original name was

343
00:25:13,01 --> 00:25:16,20
but i member he ended up
being he was known as diddy.

344
00:25:17,50 --> 00:25:22,20
He's known as diddy and that was
his name and he became john.

345
00:25:22,47 --> 00:25:25,92
Very quickly.

346
00:25:25,94 --> 00:25:30,11
And i remember one frenchman who
didn't name his child at all

347
00:25:32,17 --> 00:25:35,16
and wouldn't give her name and
she was three when i measure

348
00:25:35,16 --> 00:25:37,60
and so don't have a name but i
don't know what became of her

349
00:25:37,60 --> 00:25:50,82
and i can't remember her name.

350
00:25:51,81 --> 00:25:56,29
Oh. I think for me the most
memorable night was was.

351
00:25:56,99 --> 00:25:59,62
Well there were several there
were several memorable night.

352
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:00,57
There was one in particular

353
00:26:01,42 --> 00:26:08,00
that was a new year's eve which traditionally
was held as a sort of costume ball a

354
00:26:08,00 --> 00:26:09,75
blue knob hall.

355
00:26:09,76 --> 00:26:14,93
And a hippie costume ball is something
to be seen it was really fantastic

356
00:26:16,57 --> 00:26:22,98
and on this particular night it was
especially wonderful for me because i knew in

357
00:26:22,98 --> 00:26:22,99
advance

358
00:26:23,77 --> 00:26:29,62
that some people coming over from america
whom i greatly admired stephen gaskin

359
00:26:29,62 --> 00:26:34,88
and his wife i am a gaskin who had set up
a community in tennessee called the farm

360
00:26:36,30 --> 00:26:38,98
and was him i'd been in correspondence
for several years by then

361
00:26:40,34 --> 00:26:42,89
and they were coming to the area to
visit i knew they were due any day

362
00:26:43,96 --> 00:26:45,48
but what actually happened was

363
00:26:45,48 --> 00:26:48,77
that we were all at the dance i
do know a pool on new year's eve

364
00:26:49,87 --> 00:26:54,93
and stephen gaskin and i know may
arrive just as smiling ruth and

365
00:26:54,93 --> 00:26:58,37
and the band i think the band was
called blue skies or something

366
00:26:59,33 --> 00:27:01,52
and they just started to
play the tennessee waltz

367
00:27:01,52 --> 00:27:05,98
and by sheer coincidence steven and
i am a arrived at you know of hall

368
00:27:06,94 --> 00:27:09,17
and you know i recognized
even from a distance.

369
00:27:09,21 --> 00:27:10,84
I was outside the hall and here i've

370
00:27:10,84 --> 00:27:15,97
and i was standing facing him in the
moment when he first heard the music

371
00:27:15,97 --> 00:27:20,68
and realized what the song was and
he realized that the tennessee vols.

372
00:27:20,68 --> 00:27:24,24
Is being played and i realized that
he was steven gaskin from tennessee

373
00:27:25,14 --> 00:27:29,33
and then we looked at each other and
we just had this incredible hug

374
00:27:29,33 --> 00:27:32,39
that we never met before but
it was incredibly high.

375
00:27:32,41 --> 00:27:33,32
It was a wonderful experience

376
00:27:34,27 --> 00:27:38,97
and he went on to to spend a few weeks
around nimbin and it was a great visit

377
00:27:38,97 --> 00:27:51,57
and a great cultural exchange.

378
00:27:53,99 --> 00:27:58,08
I think there are certain parts of
the world that have a magic energy.

379
00:27:58,29 --> 00:27:59,75
I don't i couldn't define.

380
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,79
It any better than that it's it's an energy
that you feel as you approach a place.

381
00:28:05,76 --> 00:28:08,97
It might magnetize you it
could repel you i suppose

382
00:28:11,12 --> 00:28:13,66
but you know it's a feeling
that you get about play.

383
00:28:14,85 --> 00:28:18,47
And women has a very
strong spirit of place

384
00:28:19,63 --> 00:28:22,80
and i couldn't possibly define it

385
00:28:22,80 --> 00:28:27,70
but for me it's absolutely
unmistakably there and.

386
00:28:28,90 --> 00:28:29,18
I know

387
00:28:29,18 --> 00:28:32,36
that there are other people who experience
other parts of the world as having a

388
00:28:32,36 --> 00:28:34,66
similar. Vibration if you like

389
00:28:34,66 --> 00:28:39,39
and i think it's a you know it's to do
with the things that have happened there.

390
00:28:39,48 --> 00:28:40,67
The history of the place.

391
00:28:41,84 --> 00:28:47,12
I don't think those sorts of
emanations disperse very easily

392
00:28:47,12 --> 00:28:51,24
and you know there are
there's a sort of cold dank

393
00:28:51,24 --> 00:28:54,84
and nasty feeling about places where cold
dank and nasty things have happened.

394
00:28:55,26 --> 00:28:59,55
And there's a an energetic feeling about
places where energetic things have

395
00:28:59,55 --> 00:29:06,51
happened and nimbin is certainly one
of those things and i've got to go.

396
00:29:06,61 --> 00:29:07,40
Yea.
