1
00:00:01,34 --> 00:00:03,15
I'm talking to dave irvine who was

2
00:00:03,15 --> 00:00:06,29
a former riveter in the workshops during
the building of the sydney harbour bridge

3
00:00:06,99 --> 00:00:12,72
. Do you remember first getting the job
the yes i remember getting the job

4
00:00:14,53 --> 00:00:16,91
i came and mr.

5
00:00:16,92 --> 00:00:22,43
Martin. I met him in sydney in 1926. And
he asked me when i take a job on there as

6
00:00:22,43 --> 00:00:27,97
a matter of fact i had written to dorman
long's in england when i was home an

7
00:00:27,97 --> 00:00:31,25
island and they tell me i
came to the site of a make up

8
00:00:31,25 --> 00:00:35,36
a case of bridge up there. So
i came in 1926 a moment mr.

9
00:00:35,36 --> 00:00:41,05
Martin offered me the job and i was the
first really on the job in the shops and

10
00:00:41,06 --> 00:00:43,82
how long were you working
there in the shops five and

11
00:00:43,82 --> 00:00:50,20
a half years. I left there and run
december thirty one. Do you remember the

12
00:00:50,20 --> 00:00:55,42
process of riveting exactly how it was
done. Well you want me to go through that

13
00:00:55,42 --> 00:01:02,34
hydraulic and pure magic right through.
Well the hydraulic riveting was made there

14
00:01:02,35 --> 00:01:07,40
was five and six on the squad sometimes
they were very heavy hydraulic machines

15
00:01:07,40 --> 00:01:13,13
which were called on gantries by just
operated them on from the gantry and the

16
00:01:13,13 --> 00:01:17,07
holder up they just stopped them and front
of the river and the bottom i could just

17
00:01:17,07 --> 00:01:23,49
simply trying to handle. We had very very
large. Oil furnaces there which would

18
00:01:23,49 --> 00:01:25,36
hold up to half

19
00:01:25,37 --> 00:01:31,07
a bag of rivets or time all of us and then
the pure magic shop in the small shop

20
00:01:32,12 --> 00:01:37,06
well that was all more and more still there.
They had the same. There's only phone

21
00:01:37,06 --> 00:01:43,09
a squat there but they had the same
methods of heating the rivets.

22
00:01:43,89 --> 00:01:48,75
And there was the head of the ribbons the
catch boy which was considerable distance

23
00:01:48,75 --> 00:01:54,98
away sometimes. And they put it. Now the
hold up put on with his machine and just

24
00:01:54,98 --> 00:01:59,96
took the pressure and the river which
was the tribesmen down the muddy job of

25
00:01:59,96 --> 00:02:05,34
knocking it down which means and i've
tried doing the job of making the river

26
00:02:05,34 --> 00:02:05,72
forming

27
00:02:05,72 --> 00:02:12,63
a rounding ahead of can you remember the
accuracy with which the job had to be done

28
00:02:12,63 --> 00:02:15,21
. Yes accuracy events

29
00:02:15,21 --> 00:02:21,89
a group of my eastleigh all
jobs and their buildings

30
00:02:21,89 --> 00:02:24,63
shipbuilding got

31
00:02:24,64 --> 00:02:29,26
a sixteenth clearance and there were the
clouds. But on the harbour bridge. They

32
00:02:29,26 --> 00:02:32,96
all have a thirty second
clearance. And we never had

33
00:02:32,96 --> 00:02:38,10
a reamer on the job through the magnificent
marking off and the drilling of the men

34
00:02:38,10 --> 00:02:43,68
in the lightship. And you in the heavy
shot was it did it come through to you as

35
00:02:43,69 --> 00:02:48,80
plates or was it already. Partly bolted up
or was sectionals it was all sectionals

36
00:02:48,80 --> 00:02:54,32
. It was no no. Only place came through
there was all built in sections and in the

37
00:02:54,32 --> 00:02:57,90
light shop and they were pushed through
to the heavy shop where they were joined

38
00:02:57,90 --> 00:03:02,12
together again the roof further assembled
until they were complete want of

39
00:03:02,12 --> 00:03:08,33
a set to remember any machined or drilled
plates being brought from from great

40
00:03:08,33 --> 00:03:14,83
britain from middlesbrough no i've
as one fellow i interviewed recently

41
00:03:14,83 --> 00:03:20,08
who worked in the endowment lungs in
middle and he said that he was working for

42
00:03:20,08 --> 00:03:24,77
three years on drilling patris plates
whatever there. Well i could have the could

43
00:03:24,77 --> 00:03:30,75
have but every plate they took off the ships
of the side of the light shop were all

44
00:03:30,75 --> 00:03:36,41
marked off in the light shop and any and
it struck your work out there. Well i

45
00:03:36,41 --> 00:03:42,39
didn't see if anything came through the
shops were all marked of their. I want to

46
00:03:42,39 --> 00:03:45,85
follow this business through of these
buttress plates to try and get some

47
00:03:45,85 --> 00:03:48,10
resolution. Do you understand what

48
00:03:48,10 --> 00:03:55,03
a patris plate is no i don't. All
right well the bloke who was who

49
00:03:55,03 --> 00:04:00,17
was doing this drilling talks about the
plates that were what that was standard

50
00:04:00,17 --> 00:04:04,44
which were on the transverse frames on the
joints which were up on the bridge there

51
00:04:04,44 --> 00:04:11,18
were some some plates which covered
over the joint matter but battered

52
00:04:12,32 --> 00:04:16,83
but when they met when they met they have
to put the coming plate on not and then

53
00:04:16,83 --> 00:04:20,71
they were half worried all right well
according to him. These plates which were

54
00:04:20,71 --> 00:04:25,04
standard throughout the job were all drilled
in uk. Can you imagine that this might

55
00:04:25,04 --> 00:04:29,02
be so i know the answer could. Yes because
they were all staying with all the way

56
00:04:29,02 --> 00:04:34,74
through so that it could be right there
but it's just an amazing thing. And i'd

57
00:04:34,74 --> 00:04:39,72
never seen my been in there in that shot
from every river put in the last one and i

58
00:04:39,72 --> 00:04:45,29
never saw any any place coming through there
because they could have all they would

59
00:04:45,29 --> 00:04:49,06
have been joined up on the job. Wouldn't
they. There's those but you know not

60
00:04:49,06 --> 00:04:54,25
necessarily half half of might be joined
here and then i feel it in then the other

61
00:04:54,25 --> 00:04:59,54
half or really that's really how they joined
now but at the moment there. Yes well

62
00:04:59,54 --> 00:04:59,87
this is

63
00:04:59,87 --> 00:05:06,73
a mystery. I'd say no. Yes well he
reckons he was working for three years

64
00:05:06,73 --> 00:05:11,82
on drilling. Jobs for in the bridge
department for the rich i will be repetition

65
00:05:11,82 --> 00:05:18,39
because they were there assembled in the
bottom shop and we riddled them. It's i

66
00:05:18,39 --> 00:05:20,74
know that there were some things
that definitely were done over

67
00:05:20,74 --> 00:05:26,78
a nuke and that check that out and one of
the things was the pipes which acted as

68
00:05:26,78 --> 00:05:33,56
guides for them for the cables. These
pipes were made into a gigantic frame and

69
00:05:33,56 --> 00:05:37,76
a hundred twenty eight cables passed. Two
sets of these down into the tunnels and

70
00:05:37,76 --> 00:05:40,93
they were made in the uk. I suppose they
must have been an awful lot of drilling

71
00:05:40,93 --> 00:05:45,67
and that would be yes that would be there
was another job which i also know was was

72
00:05:45,67 --> 00:05:52,23
was made in the uk and this is the angle
pass which kept the position of the rods

73
00:05:52,23 --> 00:05:57,53
that bolted the bearings in from the bottom
they reckon that they were all those

74
00:05:57,53 --> 00:05:59,16
angles were all drilled in the u.k.

75
00:05:59,16 --> 00:06:04,97
Also yes because of the shop work we done
nothing whatsoever on the bottom. On the

76
00:06:04,97 --> 00:06:09,61
base but this buttress place that has me
baffled that so. Well it could be but i

77
00:06:09,61 --> 00:06:15,77
never so. Can you remember any of the other
staff around the workshop there and his

78
00:06:15,77 --> 00:06:22,18
staff. Yes out. Joe phelps no he was on
the it was the other even the inspector.

79
00:06:23,97 --> 00:06:30,52
Said thompson out martin. And who were
your riveters in the shop do you remember.

80
00:06:32,13 --> 00:06:36,57
Yeah bob mcdonnell.

81
00:06:39,54 --> 00:06:40,61
There's only but being done and

82
00:06:40,62 --> 00:06:44,77
a few of the names are so long ago they
were coming and going and i just can't

83
00:06:44,77 --> 00:06:51,64
recollect many more names.
Really hold it now. Did any of

84
00:06:51,64 --> 00:06:58,06
your men go out on the on the
arch afterwards. Oh yes yes yes.

85
00:06:58,34 --> 00:07:04,69
John yates even the arch.
And george got was

86
00:07:04,70 --> 00:07:08,75
a two from the shop the only two went up
from the shop the calico from the shop now

87
00:07:09,52 --> 00:07:15,72
. Blowing on the outside. He started on
the erection. Shouted more. All those

88
00:07:15,72 --> 00:07:21,16
routers out there. They all started from
the other side. Do you remember the day

89
00:07:21,16 --> 00:07:26,93
that kelly fell. I remember it very well
very well indeed. Yes. Please tell us

90
00:07:26,93 --> 00:07:33,87
about that. Yeah sure. And you kelly. We
are we call them net for short. He fell

91
00:07:33,87 --> 00:07:38,41
on for bridge but he might as well add
that this momo and him were very good

92
00:07:38,41 --> 00:07:42,12
commerce and they were exceptionally
good rivers i tried but they had

93
00:07:42,12 --> 00:07:42,67
a little bit of

94
00:07:42,67 --> 00:07:47,07
a knock on each other because they were
both exceptionally good divers and swimmers

95
00:07:47,07 --> 00:07:51,94
and they belong to a club in balmain and

96
00:07:51,95 --> 00:07:54,82
a certain amount of jealousy
between them. But i have

97
00:07:54,82 --> 00:08:00,25
a they're working as workmates they were
good covers. But when kelly fell in in the

98
00:08:00,25 --> 00:08:05,01
harbor. I had been speaking to him previously
several occasions and they tell me

99
00:08:05,01 --> 00:08:09,63
that the emphasis about what he would do
any event of falling out. And exactly.

100
00:08:09,85 --> 00:08:13,60
That was exactly what happened because
he fell in feet first. They reckoned his

101
00:08:13,60 --> 00:08:16,26
boots were also unsound sound
so which they were a strawman

102
00:08:16,26 --> 00:08:19,90
a punt and this more on the top

103
00:08:19,90 --> 00:08:24,28
a took six member holding back because he
wanted to jump in after to save his life

104
00:08:25,74 --> 00:08:29,17
by the way this momo rieu dived into
into time just one day at lunch time

105
00:08:29,17 --> 00:08:36,03
a cockatoo by diving in from the top of
the titan bigger like rain. But more of

106
00:08:36,03 --> 00:08:42,96
course. Kelly. He came back within
two weeks came back to where it

107
00:08:42,97 --> 00:08:45,71
was entered and with a medal.
I understand i say i met

108
00:08:45,71 --> 00:08:49,37
a lot of people that it's right up here
recover. You got to watch but i think he

109
00:08:49,37 --> 00:08:54,07
got that much from norman long but i know
where he got the medal. I think example

110
00:08:54,07 --> 00:08:59,56
from the insurance company and still have
a million dollars. We wouldn't have got

111
00:08:59,56 --> 00:09:02,62
a million dollars. The next and we would
have got would be sixteen hundred dollars

112
00:09:02,62 --> 00:09:05,77
. Even if we've got killed. Yes that's

113
00:09:05,77 --> 00:09:11,17
a yes. However that was my kelly and these
i don't know if he's still alive. No i'm

114
00:09:11,17 --> 00:09:16,61
not sure i think he died last year. How
much. Well i'm very sorry to hear that he's

115
00:09:16,61 --> 00:09:21,67
a very nice chap. Can you remember the
working conditions in the shop. Yes

116
00:09:21,67 --> 00:09:26,52
wonderful harmonious i never worked on

117
00:09:26,52 --> 00:09:30,55
a better job with harmony and
all my life. We had we have

118
00:09:30,55 --> 00:09:35,99
a working workshop committee. Every trade
was represented and we had a chairman of

119
00:09:35,99 --> 00:09:41,23
a committee epaulette called up the read
and read and was the tool smith very

120
00:09:41,23 --> 00:09:43,89
clever man clever tradesman. And

121
00:09:43,89 --> 00:09:49,23
a great orator and he kept things of peace.
He could talk to the bus and talk to

122
00:09:49,23 --> 00:09:51,89
them. With the result
we never have a strike

123
00:09:51,89 --> 00:09:56,81
a dispute on the highway job on the inside
there's people saying regarding the

124
00:09:56,81 --> 00:10:00,40
outside of the love around of the bridge
on the outside there are bad as they were

125
00:10:00,40 --> 00:10:05,27
today. I'm referring to the latter in early
but aren't the real and the harmony in

126
00:10:05,27 --> 00:10:10,27
the shop perfect. And we had a
manager there martin he was

127
00:10:10,27 --> 00:10:16,39
a very severe and solid manly one of the
pound of flesh. But he socialized with us

128
00:10:16,39 --> 00:10:17,94
all our department

129
00:10:17,94 --> 00:10:23,20
a little social functions we'd housed run
about their sergeants and markets ready

130
00:10:23,20 --> 00:10:25,08
be it a be in attendance. We have

131
00:10:25,08 --> 00:10:28,53
a cricket team and he followed us right
through but the harmony in the shop was

132
00:10:28,53 --> 00:10:30,89
absolutely perfect to play in

133
00:10:30,89 --> 00:10:36,24
a test match did you. I never played the
test. No no no that was more or less the

134
00:10:36,24 --> 00:10:40,12
office they have over on the other side.
They have that test match that we played

135
00:10:40,12 --> 00:10:43,81
and see holmes and we were run
up but when you play we have

136
00:10:43,81 --> 00:10:45,89
a very good team. After dan's up

137
00:10:45,89 --> 00:10:51,66
a down of the leading him on the in the
latch up and he was he played for he played

138
00:10:51,66 --> 00:10:52,42
for us. I'm

139
00:10:52,42 --> 00:10:56,47
a great team here at the time but he can't
stop talk me come back to me organise

140
00:10:56,47 --> 00:10:56,76
just be

141
00:10:56,76 --> 00:11:02,70
a pretty good team. A new member as opposed
to whether there were strikes or whatever

142
00:11:02,70 --> 00:11:06,96
. Do you remember the working conditions
being any different to you know what you

143
00:11:06,96 --> 00:11:12,50
remembered in other jobs or the
conditions were all right.

144
00:11:14,11 --> 00:11:19,59
Today up to date. Well of course you're
thinking of fifty odd years ago were as

145
00:11:19,60 --> 00:11:23,81
they're writing is you've got to put an
older bit of wouldn't think you carried on

146
00:11:23,81 --> 00:11:25,01
. Well knows it was

147
00:11:25,01 --> 00:11:30,26
a sign there in those days. No no. Charters
no clothes no locker rooms or nothing

148
00:11:30,26 --> 00:11:35,66
like that we have today is just the same
as they were on those days any place else

149
00:11:35,66 --> 00:11:42,54
. How did it compare with where you served
your time in the first. Well and when i

150
00:11:42,54 --> 00:11:46,88
was serving my apprenticeship. You
simply have at work about four miles of

151
00:11:46,88 --> 00:11:52,95
a job and i get into my working clothes.
One day and went to work and my working

152
00:11:52,95 --> 00:11:58,37
close knocked off and come out never even
watch my amps. It just simply never work

153
00:11:58,37 --> 00:12:04,10
and the close to moment of what was the
money like when you were on the bridge

154
00:12:05,30 --> 00:12:08,40
row well i was getting as

155
00:12:08,40 --> 00:12:15,25
a foreman i was getting there. I don't

156
00:12:15,25 --> 00:12:20,14
know. I wasn't really on
the staff but i missed

157
00:12:20,14 --> 00:12:24,70
a day i was always paid of you understand
but i'd work every saturday morning. The

158
00:12:24,70 --> 00:12:26,02
boys were in there and i bring a couple of

159
00:12:26,02 --> 00:12:30,48
a couple of squads and every week i
think about six six pounds for that as

160
00:12:30,48 --> 00:12:35,14
a form mine was was in pretty good.
Whenever i went to new guinea with such

161
00:12:35,14 --> 00:12:38,68
standing pay there and they
were giving us six pounds ten

162
00:12:38,68 --> 00:12:41,74
a week to go into new guinea to
work but you know my six pounds

163
00:12:41,74 --> 00:12:46,25
a week was pretty good. You know fact
therefore you were getting about the pound

164
00:12:46,25 --> 00:12:51,31
two pounds less than the people are
working on the arch. Yes. Well they were

165
00:12:51,31 --> 00:12:55,87
working and then i got up. That was the
conclusion they got through as i'm telling

166
00:12:55,87 --> 00:13:00,29
you those strikes and strikes and strikes
that was at the conclusion of the job.

167
00:13:01,61 --> 00:13:04,59
Early on they weren't getting anything like
the money. I was getting more than them

168
00:13:04,59 --> 00:13:11,56
for so much. To rember of the
other accidents. Oh yes it

169
00:13:11,57 --> 00:13:15,38
was not it wasn't really many actions in
the shop. But i remember one of the little

170
00:13:15,38 --> 00:13:19,77
scotch fellow men. He was working in the
heavy shop and they were preparing to take

171
00:13:19,77 --> 00:13:24,93
a lift. Don't put it on the punt and i
don't know what it was about the rapala

172
00:13:24,93 --> 00:13:30,92
little plate had them cut them on the leg
and they happened to tiger but it turned

173
00:13:30,92 --> 00:13:34,37
out pretty bad it was pretty bad in there.
He had to lose his job and that to be

174
00:13:34,37 --> 00:13:38,55
looked after and when the boys jumped
in every week and kept them. All right

175
00:13:39,39 --> 00:13:41,71
another one another bad one was

176
00:13:41,71 --> 00:13:46,29
a living hand rigger and there's no
riggers in the shop and he was a kind of

177
00:13:46,29 --> 00:13:47,96
a chain chaser

178
00:13:47,96 --> 00:13:53,80
a crane chaser. But he was supervising
they taken the plates off the boats when

179
00:13:53,80 --> 00:13:59,17
they came in the side of the chopper and
he was on the punt and lincoln ran to hit

180
00:13:59,17 --> 00:14:04,22
them and knock them in and they picked them
up there the next day it was really all

181
00:14:04,22 --> 00:14:10,87
i didn't know. You remember from
there. Where did you live at the time

182
00:14:10,87 --> 00:14:16,22
you get to work and lived in what i tell

183
00:14:17,70 --> 00:14:21,65
right on the job right and then the right
job we got up out of bed and simply

184
00:14:21,65 --> 00:14:27,17
feeling. The job. She's a wonderful person
was as far as she treated us well as

185
00:14:27,17 --> 00:14:27,74
a matter of fact

186
00:14:28,82 --> 00:14:32,32
a lot of these fellows make that they
demonstrate as i did they made application

187
00:14:32,32 --> 00:14:36,86
projects in england and they tell me of
the commodity or make up location which

188
00:14:36,86 --> 00:14:37,97
they did and i gave them

189
00:14:37,97 --> 00:14:44,47
a job. Mostly all british boys scotch
english irish belfast like myself. And

190
00:14:46,01 --> 00:14:48,12
when they get out here argument
germany might send them

191
00:14:48,12 --> 00:14:54,62
a bring them up to the hotel and this hotel
was muddy place reasonable and she met

192
00:14:54,62 --> 00:14:57,63
with these families when they came out
here they didn't know where they where she

193
00:14:57,63 --> 00:15:03,28
looked after what was the name of the hotel
they imperial right down at the gate as

194
00:15:03,28 --> 00:15:06,50
you go in. That's right. We're in

195
00:15:06,51 --> 00:15:11,25
a park is now. She's one of the water her
family which is well known in sydney know

196
00:15:11,25 --> 00:15:16,47
that she is the mother of the late charles
charles if they had the young fellow but

197
00:15:16,48 --> 00:15:21,89
a rather two sons billy which
is well known and jack about

198
00:15:23,98 --> 00:15:27,64
big time but my guess. It may make
a film on the rails. And she had

199
00:15:27,64 --> 00:15:28,90
a daughter also betty which was

200
00:15:28,90 --> 00:15:33,38
a very charming girl too. She still
alive. But that was mr water she was

201
00:15:33,38 --> 00:15:38,16
a wonderful person she mother the lot of
them they ask you. Sometimes they ask you

202
00:15:38,16 --> 00:15:42,54
what happened during the lunch ask in the
shops but we never knew we always went up

203
00:15:42,54 --> 00:15:49,21
another lovely lunch was every day. Do
you remember in the workshops there

204
00:15:50,29 --> 00:15:56,98
that you had. Well alright so
used to come up at lunchtime

205
00:15:58,60 --> 00:16:03,11
to the imperial so you didn't know what
went on doing lunch. Did you know any other

206
00:16:03,11 --> 00:16:07,11
extracurricular activities that used to
go on there during working hours. Oh yes

207
00:16:07,11 --> 00:16:07,96
yes yes there's

208
00:16:07,96 --> 00:16:12,97
a very good esprit bookmaker up shop. We
have another one down in the heavy shop

209
00:16:12,97 --> 00:16:19,44
also others to bookmakers on there within
hours. One was oh i forget his name now

210
00:16:19,44 --> 00:16:26,19
but my memory is gone but he was up on
them and they have patronized him all the

211
00:16:26,19 --> 00:16:31,30
bustle. But damn good went down on
the latch up. I've been there for

212
00:16:31,30 --> 00:16:36,04
a long long while but one of the early
release it on the ass playing and the fellow

213
00:16:36,04 --> 00:16:40,76
that picked up the rivets and brought on
the furnaces he got the best for i want to

214
00:16:40,76 --> 00:16:45,40
give you forget the name of that
the bookie in their vision.

215
00:16:48,23 --> 00:16:53,83
If you're getting your own next. Jeremy
when the art was close. Did they give you

216
00:16:53,83 --> 00:16:58,34
a mento in those days. Ah yes
yes i got a medal from mr.

217
00:16:58,34 --> 00:17:01,60
Freeman. And i meant it was a form of

218
00:17:01,60 --> 00:17:07,36
a canberra to bob the date of the locking
of the archers on the nine i'm foreman on

219
00:17:07,36 --> 00:17:12,64
it. I still go with the i believe. Do you
remember if you get the day after day to

220
00:17:12,64 --> 00:17:15,10
do for the rest of the day.
Yes we're going to have

221
00:17:15,10 --> 00:17:21,63
a day off. You know with it sure yeah.
As you say with the only frontier we got

222
00:17:21,63 --> 00:17:28,16
tight. Play out of that.
Well as anzac day they all.

223
00:17:28,17 --> 00:17:33,36
Rather funny all all the extra girls of
the first world war there were laid open

224
00:17:33,36 --> 00:17:39,38
arms that day they go to the light of
morning off they go to the cenotaph. Every

225
00:17:39,38 --> 00:17:40,13
back in the shop was

226
00:17:40,13 --> 00:17:44,10
a soldier. So they all knocked off and
they never came back and that day but they

227
00:17:44,10 --> 00:17:47,13
they got a day off before anzac day was

228
00:17:47,13 --> 00:17:52,89
a holiday. It's my birthday so i
reckon it should should be encouraged

229
00:17:54,38 --> 00:18:01,26
. The at the workshops. Do you have anything
to do with the any of the stone masons

230
00:18:01,26 --> 00:18:06,23
are as you know know now they were they
worked outside so that the fact the stones

231
00:18:06,23 --> 00:18:11,34
were already in the plane that the maria.
And then they can do only on the bus and

232
00:18:11,34 --> 00:18:16,30
they just place them in position. You didn't
have anything to do with them. Do you

233
00:18:16,30 --> 00:18:19,83
have anything to do with the people who
worked on the approaches at all. No women

234
00:18:19,83 --> 00:18:22,46
at the public works do you have anything
to do with the public works people are

235
00:18:22,46 --> 00:18:28,41
they were my opposition to satisfy our
military were very very very serious boys.

236
00:18:28,93 --> 00:18:34,60
Everything was accurate on the bridge and
up to 100 percent of happily 100 per cent

237
00:18:34,60 --> 00:18:41,45
for them every rule that was tested and
the very very few rejected very few

238
00:18:43,20 --> 00:18:48,59
. How many how many rivets were rejected
you know i couldn't tell you i mean he was

239
00:18:48,59 --> 00:18:52,86
rejected at the very very little you take
six million me that's put in the job and

240
00:18:52,86 --> 00:18:58,51
i chide they could have been a
few. But there was one occasion

241
00:18:58,51 --> 00:19:02,62
a couple of my memory i have of
the case of gone erection and

242
00:19:02,62 --> 00:19:08,80
a couple of times these inspectors
came and they tested every rivet with

243
00:19:08,80 --> 00:19:14,43
a hammer. And at with the usual low procedure
and i tried and different places to

244
00:19:14,43 --> 00:19:17,96
tighten the rivet we got to select one.
It just put a tool and hit it with

245
00:19:17,96 --> 00:19:19,22
a hammer and it made

246
00:19:19,22 --> 00:19:25,15
a little mark and it wasn't detected by
much. And the type the type written up. But

247
00:19:25,15 --> 00:19:28,55
these rivers were so heavy
and so big that you got

248
00:19:28,55 --> 00:19:32,94
a big scale on them when they got hot and
that get that scale ok you just hit them

249
00:19:32,94 --> 00:19:36,24
on a plate and it didn't at the
head of my little bit just

250
00:19:36,24 --> 00:19:41,33
a tiny little bit and when they get when
they could off that same mark was on which

251
00:19:41,33 --> 00:19:44,81
with which we represent as we've
been marking. And it took me quite

252
00:19:44,81 --> 00:19:48,62
a want to discover that or it would
have been a big big big fault have been

253
00:19:48,62 --> 00:19:55,57
a big blue i was but we found out and they
were great the place was what it was so

254
00:19:55,57 --> 00:19:59,21
in actual fact they didn't reject them
for that they were not. They couldn't

255
00:19:59,21 --> 00:20:03,55
because they were perfect only for that
little mark which was quite it was in the

256
00:20:03,55 --> 00:20:07,55
trade that that was the math at the time
on the map. What happened if you say

257
00:20:07,55 --> 00:20:11,35
overheated to rivet what would
happen if there were heated

258
00:20:11,35 --> 00:20:16,87
a rivet. I could never never just simply.
You could put the rivet in there and

259
00:20:16,87 --> 00:20:22,26
would burn away and not run out. Well if
it got burned at all. It had to be thrown

260
00:20:22,26 --> 00:20:26,36
away. Yeah well it never they never get
they get the period we never get another

261
00:20:26,36 --> 00:20:32,67
show any time but that was what that's what
would happen. There's those we put half

262
00:20:32,67 --> 00:20:36,67
a bag or ever since that time. There's
those that say over the harbor that the

263
00:20:36,67 --> 00:20:40,57
amount of burnt ones that were checked
over the side. You could have

264
00:20:40,57 --> 00:20:44,25
a bridge alone on a over the
over the and i burnt with

265
00:20:44,25 --> 00:20:45,86
a burnt with it if you put up

266
00:20:45,86 --> 00:20:51,37
a river in coke. You'll burn it on the point
and it will all swell up and burn burn

267
00:20:52,20 --> 00:20:56,04
but when you put it in the same heat all
the way you can't get it by the church

268
00:20:56,04 --> 00:21:02,91
just simply melt but it
won't burn. When you

269
00:21:02,91 --> 00:21:06,02
light off off the bridge then the work of

270
00:21:06,02 --> 00:21:10,99
a riveting work was completed in the shop.
Absolutely. Complete. I left work on

271
00:21:10,99 --> 00:21:14,32
friday night and i got
on the big jury doing

272
00:21:14,32 --> 00:21:18,89
a maiden voyage in new guinea on the summer
they morning. So i was never off one

273
00:21:18,89 --> 00:21:22,81
minute he had a job of a new guinea.
I went to new guinea for the below

274
00:21:22,81 --> 00:21:27,97
a gal dredging calmly approach me prior
to leaving there i didn't left on the my

275
00:21:27,97 --> 00:21:33,45
own steam and we went to new guinea and
built some bridges up there as up there for

276
00:21:33,45 --> 00:21:38,77
eighteen months. He's anything else that
sticks in your memory or linear amusing

277
00:21:38,77 --> 00:21:44,21
stories that stick in your memory from the
time she worked on the bridge. Do you

yes. Dr. Brett then went overseas

279
00:21:51,16 --> 00:21:51,95
and i was

280
00:21:51,95 --> 00:21:58,68
a foreman and when he came back. At
used to be my job to meet all these

281
00:21:58,68 --> 00:22:02,79

a time when he's up to dinner speeches i've
heard of myself years. Can you think of

293
00:22:44,94 --> 00:22:50,75
any other funny stories that happened during
the building of the bridge. Oh yes yes

294
00:22:50,75 --> 00:22:57,48
yes this is a goodie. One of these good
fellows. At came out here and i got

295
00:22:57,48 --> 00:23:00,26
a commendation up and mr.

296
00:23:00,26 --> 00:23:05,50
Wharton holmes's. His name is damn the
month i think is still alive. He worked at

297
00:23:05,50 --> 00:23:10,51
a work to bonnaroo powers last time i heard
up and down the month. And i don't mean

get them to go to job is just cheeky and

301
00:23:24,09 --> 00:23:29,27
it wasn't them. It just this monday morning.
It just wouldn't do anything in the

302
00:23:29,27 --> 00:23:31,11
front of the squad. He was making me look

303
00:23:31,11 --> 00:23:37,24
a fool and then he invited they want to
fight me want to fight me so i knew damn

304
00:23:37,24 --> 00:23:41,59

i'll fight you. So we went up the ramp

305
00:23:42,50 --> 00:23:46,60
went up to the paddock in front of the pub
and he grabbed my hand he said dave you

306
00:23:46,60 --> 00:23:50,38

head's bursting he said come another drink

307
00:23:51,76 --> 00:23:54,23
which i did and we can die
and he went to work in

308
00:23:54,23 --> 00:24:01,07
a big hit on the monday. That's as true
as god and they were used to do in

309
00:24:01,07 --> 00:24:05,31
any spare time when you had money and
in those days in sydney. When you were

310
00:24:05,31 --> 00:24:10,50
working on the bridge this money business
on there was days we went dancing made

311
00:24:10,50 --> 00:24:10,67
quite

312
00:24:10,67 --> 00:24:17,68
a lot of plenty of entertainment
where used to go to the ball

the fellow that struck

315
00:24:27,39 --> 00:24:32,40
a beer out. Jack we were working on the
bridge when every start of the track at

316
00:24:32,40 --> 00:24:34,45
their own. So we used to go there were

317
00:24:34,45 --> 00:24:39,77

married of course at the time but

318
00:24:41,80 --> 00:24:46,42
tell me about this how tell most
of what has a hotel. What you have

319
00:24:46,42 --> 00:24:52,25
a nice charming little girl surely sixteen.
And this is what i choose to bring up

320
00:24:52,25 --> 00:24:59,23
from in the give and i am making beds at
separate and general work tipple of being

321
00:24:59,23 --> 00:25:03,91

kid and if you want to ask me many

322
00:25:03,91 --> 00:25:08,32

the pictures and i'm with stella and she

323
00:25:08,32 --> 00:25:10,05

325
00:25:12,94 --> 00:25:19,40
a lot. I married the
bugger. If she's still

326
00:25:19,40 --> 00:25:23,13
a charming girl. So it's

327
00:25:23,13 --> 00:25:29,98
a good story and. The orpheum picture
show in sydney you mention where was that

328
00:25:30,76 --> 00:25:36,67
it was right and nearly on the way of the
bridge there and they approach is no

329
00:25:36,67 --> 00:25:41,45
sydney station. I think it's building
and i think it might make way for

330
00:25:41,45 --> 00:25:46,41
a roadway for the bridge but there's another
reference. I don't know whether you

331
00:25:46,41 --> 00:25:47,86
can remember this. There was

332
00:25:47,86 --> 00:25:53,04
a famous fire during the time of the building
of the bridge. It was called the p f

333
00:25:53,04 --> 00:25:59,46
a building fire remember where that
was no now only had a fire and

334
00:25:59,46 --> 00:26:04,14
a hotel up there nearly off in the other
was quite a big fire but it was in

335
00:26:04,14 --> 00:26:10,54
a hotel. You know you can remember. Do you
member any of the other picture places

336
00:26:10,54 --> 00:26:16,90
in town then city. Oh yes
yes yes. Used to go to the.

337
00:26:18,13 --> 00:26:19,16
Usually through we went on

338
00:26:19,16 --> 00:26:25,85
a sunday night but they.

339
00:26:25,87 --> 00:26:27,45
Oh yes we used to get

340
00:26:27,45 --> 00:26:32,08
a bit the capital thing ever used to go
up there and they couldn't charge you on

341
00:26:32,08 --> 00:26:35,78
a sunday night but they had all sorts
of entertainment fights and they had

342
00:26:35,78 --> 00:26:38,36
a they had a animal show
is there and you just put

343
00:26:38,36 --> 00:26:42,100
a silver coin in but little one and then
we went the prince edward they were

344
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,23
building the state there at the time that
we got the prince edward and the really

345
00:26:47,23 --> 00:26:52,19
good show. There was about the fact we saw
the first talking picture of their mummy

346
00:26:52,19 --> 00:26:57,23
show. Other just think it was just so you
know that they were just opposite the

347
00:26:57,23 --> 00:27:04,21
hotel australia. If you did did you pay
extra to go and see that i think we did

348
00:27:04,21 --> 00:27:10,64
the first one leave we were very
impressed with it seems do you remember

349
00:27:11,50 --> 00:27:18,05
any australian films and australian
films that was deb and dave and

350
00:27:18,05 --> 00:27:21,78
the below that sort of stuff but i was
never much we didn't have much them.
