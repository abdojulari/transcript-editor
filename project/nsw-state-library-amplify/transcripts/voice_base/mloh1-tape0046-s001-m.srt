1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:00,88
I'm speaking to mr.

2
00:00:00,88 --> 00:00:05,51
Bill talents and who worked on the sydney
harbour bridge approaches as a concrete

3
00:00:05,51 --> 00:00:12,46
a who is that correct. Mr thomson. Yes i
worked as in the concrete gang material is

4
00:00:12,46 --> 00:00:17,59
getting these local and we kept the
materials up to the concrete mixers was

5
00:00:17,60 --> 00:00:24,54
a dumping materials. Yes. Metal sand and
cement. Did you do that in rickshaws

6
00:00:24,54 --> 00:00:29,46
or. You know what her way and that made
a lorries quite a lot on the job quite

7
00:00:29,46 --> 00:00:33,69
a big job at the corner and
all those big arches took

8
00:00:33,70 --> 00:00:38,99
a lot of material i met on the sands and
there. Where did you start first. I

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,44
started on the north side
and and i was stationed

10
00:00:46,66 --> 00:00:52,86
where the north sydney railway station
is the day i think it was originally

11
00:00:55,13 --> 00:01:02,07
and depot good yard there and that's where
the start of the tunnel where they had

12
00:01:02,07 --> 00:01:08,54
already been built and in the tunnel was
one tunnel that went over the other

13
00:01:08,54 --> 00:01:14,25
tunnels into those account my spin the
plans at that particular time. But there's

14
00:01:14,25 --> 00:01:19,98
no eventuated of the tunnel still there
that they need to be used as i know what do

15
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:26,35
you did you start. I started in
nineteen twenty. Seven i think it was

16
00:01:27,38 --> 00:01:34,27
early twenty seven or late 20s. So the
station was already operating then they put

17
00:01:34,27 --> 00:01:39,06
the tunnel. You know was not rating not
for goods. Didn't you didn't just come in

18
00:01:39,06 --> 00:01:43,87
through the rail. Oh yeah but the you
know it was there. Exactly. Before the

19
00:01:45,39 --> 00:01:49,97
project started. I think they built the
tunnel the first up that i performed my

20
00:01:49,97 --> 00:01:55,12
time. Yes. Oh i know that dr.

21
00:01:55,13 --> 00:01:58,27
Bread rolls writings he said that the
first thing to do was to get the tunnels

22
00:01:58,27 --> 00:02:02,96
through so that they could use them for
bringing in materials that they did that

23
00:02:02,96 --> 00:02:09,92
they didn't tell me that who took
you on first and i would know

24
00:02:09,92 --> 00:02:15,49
i don't say i got the job through i was
and you sort of follow the storm and back

25
00:02:15,49 --> 00:02:16,55
as up which was

26
00:02:16,55 --> 00:02:23,50
a seasonal job and in the wintertime
with no work and in the hall and i

27
00:02:23,50 --> 00:02:30,33
used to. Keep in touch with
the union office in the trays

28
00:02:30,33 --> 00:02:35,20
all through casual and one particular
day i was there and i think mr.

29
00:02:35,20 --> 00:02:38,81
Gardner garden he had

30
00:02:38,81 --> 00:02:44,28
a meeting for the unemployed
and how that meeting. I got

31
00:02:44,29 --> 00:02:46,29
a notice to report for

32
00:02:46,29 --> 00:02:53,28
a job i was on the bridge and i
thought myself then that i was going

33
00:02:53,28 --> 00:03:00,08
to work on the bridge itself and i
reported to them. The long on the

34
00:03:00,08 --> 00:03:06,73
north side of the harbour and they
directed me to the public works i

35
00:03:06,73 --> 00:03:13,52
didn't know anything about and so and
along and when i heard about the public

36
00:03:13,52 --> 00:03:14,90
works i said see this will do me

37
00:03:14,90 --> 00:03:18,10
a government stroke. You
know but that was it figures

38
00:03:18,10 --> 00:03:24,50
a mistake i ever made it work too hard to
do i say you know there. When so i was in

39
00:03:26,37 --> 00:03:32,05
you know material again and the brain and
all of material the sand the metal and

40
00:03:32,05 --> 00:03:38,13
the some hand through the tunnels. Whenever
i come from into this depot and the

41
00:03:38,13 --> 00:03:43,36
gang high we used to empty the railway track
in the lorry and lorry used to take it

42
00:03:43,36 --> 00:03:49,47
to the mixers. So that all shovel work
was shovel work and home issues and then

43
00:03:49,47 --> 00:03:54,97
days. Remember you're going to do your
boss. Yeah that's happened they made

44
00:03:56,28 --> 00:04:01,83
charlie peach. I think he's dead now. What
was he like you. Nice chap but he was

45
00:04:01,83 --> 00:04:07,25
a little you know days so i don't think
he last that long here. Now do you shovel

46
00:04:07,25 --> 00:04:13,23
as well. Oh no. Now he he never shall of
the director who haggis and that i now.

47
00:04:14,14 --> 00:04:16,70
But i've got a picture of

48
00:04:16,70 --> 00:04:19,80
a fellow an old fellow who was
in that that yard area them

49
00:04:19,80 --> 00:04:21,30
a start and used to wear

50
00:04:21,30 --> 00:04:26,51
a waistcoat white shirt. Yeah
they could be him but there was

51
00:04:26,51 --> 00:04:31,35
a right and you know just tie and i think
he name is bill was his first name not

52
00:04:31,36 --> 00:04:35,88
shepherd here that i built shepherd. Well
he was the foreman of all the public

53
00:04:35,88 --> 00:04:41,77
works on both sides. That's why and why i
remember bill shepherd was that. Do you

54
00:04:41,77 --> 00:04:48,49
mean that in our job and unloading
the trucks every day every

55
00:04:48,49 --> 00:04:49,80
evening. You get

56
00:04:49,80 --> 00:04:55,51
a truckload. Trainload of trucks line and

57
00:04:56,99 --> 00:04:58,91
they are job doing so well on

58
00:04:58,91 --> 00:05:05,30
a friday. On the friday that trucks had
come in about three or four o'clock and

59
00:05:07,01 --> 00:05:11,35
if they were kept over the weekend the
public work you have to pay the railway

60
00:05:11,35 --> 00:05:18,24
people demurrage so much extra on
the truck see this pretty hard

61
00:05:18,24 --> 00:05:22,10
you know work and all day. You know you
know there was officially in the summertime

62
00:05:22,10 --> 00:05:26,21
when night down the hole and it's pretty
warm you know that i was young and silly

63
00:05:26,21 --> 00:05:31,83
and i've led to work and because no times
it was suppression to actually was

64
00:05:31,83 --> 00:05:32,86
depression time you know

65
00:05:32,86 --> 00:05:37,32
a lot of unemployed and i was pleased
i just been married i pleased to have

66
00:05:37,32 --> 00:05:44,30
a job and i didn't say i die at the work
the dolans i got out what happened. But

67
00:05:45,56 --> 00:05:52,48
when four o'clock come and the late young
come in. Bill shepherd used really up all

68
00:05:52,48 --> 00:05:54,11
the other trucks and all the other get

69
00:05:54,11 --> 00:05:58,58
a different gauge you know and bring it
up to help. But they're doubly hard is

70
00:05:58,58 --> 00:06:05,44
going to get the tax unloaded
by the time you know

71
00:06:06,30 --> 00:06:11,91
your time and bill shepherd i
know member now clearly he is

72
00:06:11,91 --> 00:06:16,45
a run up and down attacks and if you just
stood up and straighten your back. You

73
00:06:16,45 --> 00:06:21,24
think you'd hear somebody sing out get in
there. We'll get out there. You got the

74
00:06:21,24 --> 00:06:25,85
thing and in them they were talking
about public works and you know and the

75
00:06:25,85 --> 00:06:28,14
government started well that was

76
00:06:28,14 --> 00:06:33,41
a mistake on my bar but part on that i
found you know the job pretty good.

77
00:06:35,80 --> 00:06:40,78
Tell me the bridge approach is there when
you you loaded the trucks and you also

78
00:06:40,78 --> 00:06:44,95
did you unload at the cement mixers and
that's only so i meant because i guess the

79
00:06:44,95 --> 00:06:49,12
tip that they used to tip the metal in the
sand but the cement used to be stacked

80
00:06:49,12 --> 00:06:53,79
alongside them. So you were used to go
with the trucks you ask first unload the

81
00:06:53,79 --> 00:06:59,58
railway wagons onto the onto
the road trucks to do well

82
00:07:00,76 --> 00:07:04,68
where we wouldn't go anywhere with the
sand on the metal but the people whose and

83
00:07:04,68 --> 00:07:11,07
some in gang which i was one we had done
load the track with us. I meant. And

84
00:07:11,08 --> 00:07:15,28
if the cement board with

85
00:07:15,28 --> 00:07:21,82
a mix or i was empty. We keep the bags on
and we'd take from the truck too but if

86
00:07:21,82 --> 00:07:22,80
not they had

87
00:07:22,80 --> 00:07:27,63
a shed in the yard. Especially for the
sump bags i meant and we used to put the

88
00:07:27,63 --> 00:07:33,94
surplus in in the so we them to take it
out of the trucks or so in actual fact

89
00:07:33,94 --> 00:07:36,76
there was no road trucks you were going
straight from the rower trucks to the

90
00:07:36,76 --> 00:07:43,74
cement mixer. Shed. And

91
00:07:43,74 --> 00:07:47,89
if if there are no railway tracks well
natalie if i get out of the shed. How many

92
00:07:47,89 --> 00:07:54,56
mixers were there on the spot
that i wouldn't now. I think

93
00:07:54,56 --> 00:07:56,18
three or four with

94
00:07:56,19 --> 00:08:01,99
a one cubic garden sheens or the bigger big
consumer i mean being that i didn't go

95
00:08:01,99 --> 00:08:06,52
into details and you know when i
was pretty hard our chaps had

96
00:08:06,52 --> 00:08:10,33
a pretty hard job clean. You know where
there is the cement mixers all the cement

97
00:08:10,33 --> 00:08:15,27
mixers for the northern approaches where
there are only for the north idea that's

98
00:08:15,27 --> 00:08:21,69
tied and south side there are you know depot
and where the cement was mixed it you

99
00:08:21,69 --> 00:08:28,14
know just how they handled it gently
went into burrows and was tracked to the

100
00:08:29,14 --> 00:08:36,05
site that was they bring the cement
mixer up near the case of the job

101
00:08:36,86 --> 00:08:37,09
pole

102
00:08:37,09 --> 00:08:43,98
a course on and they work on that but
then how did these cement. When when that

103
00:08:43,98 --> 00:08:49,19
happened. Did you have to go out with it
and deliver the stuff. When you mean. Well

104
00:08:49,19 --> 00:08:52,75
if they move the cement mixer up you'd have
to do you move the material as well and

105
00:08:52,75 --> 00:08:57,48
i want to say when when they finish their
job they generally finished up most of

106
00:08:57,48 --> 00:09:01,16
the material you know they wouldn't take
more than what they required and they

107
00:09:01,16 --> 00:09:01,39
don't have

108
00:09:01,39 --> 00:09:06,89
a little bit of you know at that shift
that the ship there because they had all

109
00:09:06,89 --> 00:09:11,40
those big walls you know and they approach
it from down the bottom or three out

110
00:09:12,32 --> 00:09:19,10
right up the bridge down up to the arches
and they wouldn't know moved too far.

111
00:09:19,27 --> 00:09:23,19
Once i went clear in my
mind although i've seen

112
00:09:23,19 --> 00:09:27,12
a lot of photographs on how they did it.
I haven't got it clear in my mind where

113
00:09:27,12 --> 00:09:33,72
the what where you moved the cement to
cement and sand and metal and also where the

114
00:09:33,72 --> 00:09:36,88
. There's a bent mix as were did
the cement mixers move up with

115
00:09:36,88 --> 00:09:40,69
a job in which case did they use our trucks
to move it up to them or what did they

116
00:09:40,69 --> 00:09:47,34
do. Oh no. The the mixers we're on
wheels and they be pulled on by

117
00:09:47,34 --> 00:09:52,79
a wagon lorry thing and whenever they go
over there. We couldn't news any railway

118
00:09:52,79 --> 00:09:58,82
track macaws have no rails. You know. So
what did you do then. And so what do you

119
00:09:58,82 --> 00:10:04,54
do then to get the sound of metal and
cement up to the mixer you unloaded it from

120
00:10:04,54 --> 00:10:07,81
railway trucks and then what
the road as already formed

121
00:10:08,91 --> 00:10:14,33
a dirt road we already formed and enough
of the trucks motor trucks used to take

122
00:10:14,33 --> 00:10:19,99
the material up the mixer and tippet out
on the board. You know and you would go

123
00:10:19,99 --> 00:10:25,80
and with them and unload the cement only
the summit yeah the summit. And because

124
00:10:26,88 --> 00:10:31,56
all the while the only be when they needed
us i mean that we had you know the metal

125
00:10:31,56 --> 00:10:35,77
in the sand was the biggest part they needed
more so when we went back and those i

126
00:10:35,77 --> 00:10:39,02
meant when we got back into the tracks
unload trucks i meant wealthy and whatever

127
00:10:39,02 --> 00:10:41,75
may be you know how many hours

128
00:10:41,75 --> 00:10:48,53
a day to do work those days eight days
it out. I think forty forty four starter

129
00:10:48,53 --> 00:10:54,38
forty four forty four. I think we know
what union we're you in i thin the

130
00:10:56,78 --> 00:10:57,18
w

131
00:10:59,22 --> 00:11:05,92
w that the dime and my gang. I
mean about the travel. What

132
00:11:07,01 --> 00:11:12,58
do you want no strikes no less don't work.
We now have few disputes we and i would

133
00:11:12,58 --> 00:11:18,60
shed. For our change quarters and whenever
it rained we came in and the water be

134
00:11:18,60 --> 00:11:21,61
floating around the food to be float
around the money and we jacked up

135
00:11:21,61 --> 00:11:23,74
a couple of times but we got

136
00:11:23,74 --> 00:11:30,68
a bit of attention so we never never
had to resort to someone work and who

137
00:11:30,69 --> 00:11:37,40
did you see when there was this dispute who
did you go and see and oh we report at

138
00:11:37,40 --> 00:11:44,37
the gang at charlie peach and he deported
back to the office and they'd send some

139
00:11:44,37 --> 00:11:49,80
money out. Jim meeting any of the public
works engineers. I can't say i did.

140
00:11:52,04 --> 00:11:55,56
I don't remember any many other gang of
even on the job only one up sticks in my

141
00:11:55,56 --> 00:12:02,55
mind as charlie let's remember him
at all. Mention that big chap he was

142
00:12:02,55 --> 00:12:09,33
a ganger on one other material concrete
or what was he like oh he's like

143
00:12:09,33 --> 00:12:15,42
again if you know yet that
to you at the job. Was

144
00:12:15,42 --> 00:12:17,64
a i've i've heard. I've heard

145
00:12:17,64 --> 00:12:24,50
a few stories about public works going as
re. Them being not. Not too particular

146
00:12:24,50 --> 00:12:27,64
about the way they handle people looking
for jobs or even people had jobs

147
00:12:27,64 --> 00:12:31,28
threatening them with wanting something out
of their pay or what anything do i come

148
00:12:31,28 --> 00:12:36,11
across like anything like that nothing at
all at all. Now i'd be up against that

149
00:12:36,11 --> 00:12:40,99
state and would go. You know who had
been one union stickin up myself. And if

150
00:12:40,99 --> 00:12:47,58
anything like that happen and i was one
person and yes and i had the one yeah

151
00:12:49,49 --> 00:12:53,81
wasn't my gang of they we went down to
help them out there and there you know

152
00:12:53,81 --> 00:12:57,89
a feeling that when they used to do the
archway that used to be the biggest job

153
00:12:57,89 --> 00:13:04,06
because when they started on the arch they
had to do the whole lot. That's lavender

154
00:13:04,06 --> 00:13:09,88
street art and if it's right there will
allow and i see. Well we have the arch was

155
00:13:09,88 --> 00:13:14,84
finished and we are down doing the roadway
and this particular gang. You see get in

156
00:13:14,84 --> 00:13:18,19
the middle of the roadway where you
could see and hear the footy foot up on

157
00:13:18,19 --> 00:13:22,67
something and they wouldn't move for hours.
I mean you know and it's not necessary

158
00:13:22,67 --> 00:13:28,07
to you know stand over i mean like that.
You know that when i see the men on the

159
00:13:28,07 --> 00:13:32,94
job they all did this year they said
before there were no public. No government

160

00:15:06,86 --> 00:15:13,59
early part of my life. Tell me.
Also read the bridge again

179
00:15:13,59 --> 00:15:17,84
on the day they poured the airing
of lavender street art which was

180
00:15:17,84 --> 00:15:22,40
a world record at that time were you in
on that you know that i was kept in some

181
00:15:22,40 --> 00:15:29,17
end up timer on the boards and those
particular davie used to start earlier think

182
00:15:29,17 --> 00:15:34,97
that he evolve extra. Over time. Of
course and very welcome those days

183
00:15:36,62 --> 00:15:42,86
and boys just earned their money on the.
It was hard work just one or four board to

184
00:15:42,86 --> 00:15:48,28
actually medal and say in shoveling into
the mix. Oh yeah shall and i mean you know

185
00:15:48,28 --> 00:15:52,61
i never done that much of that myself and
do you remember the quantity that was

186
00:15:52,61 --> 00:15:57,41
done in that in that arch ring that day i
can't idea. As i should put it on record

187
00:15:57,41 --> 00:16:00,74
. I don't have it with me actually. But i
should put it on record and but i know

188
00:16:00,74 --> 00:16:01,18
that it was

189
00:16:01,18 --> 00:16:05,53
a record at that time and it was the
lavender street arch wasn't it yet. That's

190
00:16:05,53 --> 00:16:09,83
right. Yes i remember that they did say
that they missed so many bags i mean it

191
00:16:09,83 --> 00:16:15,31
used in particular for what time did you
get finished that they owe i think if he's

192
00:16:15,31 --> 00:16:20,70
around about six o'clock in the issue then
where did you know fifty or do you know

193
00:16:21,44 --> 00:16:24,62
where did you go then. Did you go straight
home or did you go over the pope. Oh at

194
00:16:24,62 --> 00:16:29,22
the public eye which but was it. We had
one right on the job right outside the

195
00:16:29,22 --> 00:16:35,87
depot. I think that they are
that not there now because

196
00:16:38,38 --> 00:16:44,39
well can i take you back for your memory
thing more on the on the on the bridge

197
00:16:44,39 --> 00:16:49,02
approach is there anything outstanding
any accident. At least how only thing

198
00:16:49,02 --> 00:16:55,82
outstanding. I i remember was one
particular day one afternoon

199
00:16:55,82 --> 00:16:59,87
of getting ready to knock off and just
in the change room at the bottom of the

200
00:17:01,46 --> 00:17:02,03
morning walk

201
00:17:02,03 --> 00:17:08,30
a street i thrown where the picture shows
used to be and still is and we looked

202
00:17:08,30 --> 00:17:14,04
across the harbor and we saw. So all the
people struggling in the water with the ax

203
00:17:14,04 --> 00:17:20,94
and all the great lift and
that the laws. That stand out

204
00:17:20,94 --> 00:17:26,33
in my memory and how that no accident on
the job and the only when i run. I mean we

205
00:17:26,33 --> 00:17:32,24
are an accident when we were when those xo
bait and for the stairs in the mountains

206
00:17:32,25 --> 00:17:39,18
point. Railway station. I
would happen to be. Down i

207
00:17:39,18 --> 00:17:43,55
mean in our spike spare time when they're
down material to go where you go with the

208
00:17:43,55 --> 00:17:49,87
other games and roadway and things like
that help out. Keep that occupied and was

209
00:17:49,87 --> 00:17:53,18
actually late and this what you go
on and then x of eight and back and

210
00:17:53,18 --> 00:17:57,92
a lot of the day and you know and i went
to steady it and buying that i got me

211
00:17:57,92 --> 00:18:03,21
a hand caught in the clip and i lost that
even the finger part of me as in bedded

212
00:18:03,21 --> 00:18:06,74
in the bridge somewhere. Yes i see it's

213
00:18:06,74 --> 00:18:11,00
a top joint you lost seven eight seven
eight and they are going to like you get

214
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,50
compo for that. Yeah yeah.
ninety to ninety dollars in

215
00:18:14,50 --> 00:18:19,22
a ninety pound i mean those day than the
insurers reckon i only lost seven eight of

216
00:18:19,22 --> 00:18:24,65
a deal and so i only got seven eights and
ninety dollars. Do you member any other

217
00:18:24,65 --> 00:18:30,04
serious accidents remember fatalities
they're not on and on they're pros. Kate i

218
00:18:30,04 --> 00:18:33,66
heard occasion when going off
a bridge you know there was

219
00:18:33,66 --> 00:18:39,74
a carpenter and on the fitzroy that
collapsed and he lost his life. I don't

220
00:18:39,74 --> 00:18:44,49
remember them. And in addition to that
there was somebody working there were

221
00:18:44,49 --> 00:18:49,81
wrecked in a crane and that taking the
crane apart crane parts off a truck with

222
00:18:49,81 --> 00:18:54,55
a shear legs and suddenly one leg of the
share legs collapsed into the earth and it

223
00:18:54,56 --> 00:18:57,99
turned over on him killing and immediately.
You know i heard about that but i was

224
00:18:57,99 --> 00:19:03,52
nowhere near that you know about eyewitness
account of it. And one bloke got killed

225
00:19:03,52 --> 00:19:04,40
in the train and work by

226
00:19:04,40 --> 00:19:08,93
a tram working in the street there as well.
Yeah i didn't know that because i did

227
00:19:08,93 --> 00:19:15,86
say and i started in 1927 saying
well it was going well before i

228
00:19:15,86 --> 00:19:22,59
was well advanced when i. And then
twenty seven was well advanced

229
00:19:22,59 --> 00:19:26,82
you know they've been working some time
when i don't know what time they started

230
00:19:26,82 --> 00:19:33,78
you know the approach that there were
nineteen twenty seventeen in the

231
00:19:33,78 --> 00:19:39,61
1930 to us there after the bridge was
one of the last ones to go. Where you

232
00:19:40,78 --> 00:19:44,79
were you in the procession on the day
the bridge opened and yeah you know

233
00:19:45,59 --> 00:19:48,11
processional right and we got

234
00:19:48,11 --> 00:19:53,50
a crowd of it to that day. Yeah i remember
the mob on the fence you know to get i

235
00:19:53,50 --> 00:19:58,79
guess all the crystal ball in the margin
you know everybody would wait you see

236
00:19:58,79 --> 00:19:59,98
they'd all be on the bearded with

237
00:19:59,98 --> 00:20:05,09
a cool day and it wasn't too good not
black and so it happened that you know

238
00:20:05,09 --> 00:20:09,00
somewhat out the empty out and that's where
they do that over the fence just at the

239
00:20:10,05 --> 00:20:13,68
start of the style of the bridge whether
the time was like we need to we need

240
00:20:15,30 --> 00:20:19,42

pretty wet you hoes and the car down and

317
00:26:39,84 --> 00:26:42,13

a strong booze me i'm wrong blucher
boots and i mean but try and i out and

319
00:26:48,94 --> 00:26:54,51

blistered me bloomin feet and

320
00:26:55,74 --> 00:27:00,15
going home when i got the time and i had
the stands on the rail over most angelo

321
00:27:00,15 --> 00:27:04,71

a father saying when they had

322
00:27:04,71 --> 00:27:09,98
a walk from granville to guilford to get
home and i tell you my first produced

323
00:27:10,83 --> 00:27:15,63
a thing that sticks in my memory about you
know trying to do that save myself the

324
00:27:15,63 --> 00:27:17,03
money and i lost

325
00:27:17,03 --> 00:27:22,65
a lot of skin froze there anybody you
know involved in the in the seventeen

326
00:27:22,65 --> 00:27:28,07
struggle and you member the family being

327
00:27:29,61 --> 00:27:34,43
being interested in the conscription debate
as well. And it other the way at the

328
00:27:34,43 --> 00:27:36,38
time i think you called up as

329
00:27:36,38 --> 00:27:41,89
a boy soldier. I thought everybody had
to go all the boys had to go into the

330
00:27:43,15 --> 00:27:48,02
compulsory training like theirs i
belong to the militia. That's why i had

331
00:27:48,02 --> 00:27:53,12
a trip to camp to liverpool and i was quite
an experience you enjoy that. Oh yeah

332
00:27:53,12 --> 00:27:56,85
it was alright was a change and
you have to go along. One night

333
00:27:56,85 --> 00:27:59,38
a week as well you know i'd like in

334
00:27:59,38 --> 00:28:06,36
a way that i i. After i went to camp after

335
00:28:06,37 --> 00:28:12,47
i had to camp i come back and i put me in
uniform you know and all the gear in and

336
00:28:12,48 --> 00:28:17,12
i supposed to report to back
on the job. I suppose in

337
00:28:17,12 --> 00:28:21,37
a certain time and anyway i got to go. I
never heard any more about it. I didn't do

338
00:28:21,37 --> 00:28:23,56
any more training. Nobody
want i could have been

339
00:28:23,56 --> 00:28:30,14
a good soldier could i say. You know i
think it was doing. Do you remember during

340
00:28:30,14 --> 00:28:35,98
the depression time. You know how it was
for you. I mean did you get less work

341
00:28:35,98 --> 00:28:40,73
because of the because of the depression
that strawman back. Oh yeah yeah. P

342
00:28:40,74 --> 00:28:41,58
opposition and

343
00:28:41,58 --> 00:28:48,51
a you know we on the dole. We were on the
dole and i'm now i would say yes only

344
00:28:48,51 --> 00:28:55,04
do about i'd be lucky if i get six months
in the years he will you can then up and

345
00:28:55,04 --> 00:28:55,49
six months

346
00:28:55,49 --> 00:29:00,07
a lark you know the other think month and
again cause the dole wasn't that you

347
00:29:00,07 --> 00:29:04,93
could say in the first part i remember
which i didn't have to experience yourself

348
00:29:04,93 --> 00:29:09,94
was that you used and i
used to have to report to

349
00:29:09,95 --> 00:29:15,09
a place at the railway and they used to
dish out the bread and the meat and those

350
00:29:15,09 --> 00:29:20,69
things like that and i'd believe it used
to be you know pretty rough. If you didn't

351
00:29:20,69 --> 00:29:25,21
like it. Well you know you could love it
and the people serving out of course used

352
00:29:25,21 --> 00:29:25,39
to get

353
00:29:25,39 --> 00:29:33,12
a bit cranky and i remember one
particular time we're chap. With

354
00:29:33,13 --> 00:29:38,43
yet need meat. And i mean this is
hearsay mind and that line that

355
00:29:40,27 --> 00:29:45,32
he said hey look at this meeting he said.
How how would you like to take that home

356
00:29:45,32 --> 00:29:50,11
to your wife and the japs and he said i
don't have to and the bank just got the

357
00:29:50,11 --> 00:29:55,39
meet and slap you know faith and
that was their attitude and quite

358
00:29:55,40 --> 00:29:59,72
a you know maybe body one the same i find
it in life and you know you find stinkers

359
00:29:59,72 --> 00:30:06,58
and good bloods you know and how did
you get away in my dealings with

360
00:30:06,58 --> 00:30:13,15
the with the dull was that i
used to have to get the offers

361
00:30:13,90 --> 00:30:18,82
and they used to give me coupons and used
to take the coupons to the graces and the

362
00:30:18,82 --> 00:30:24,56
bakers and the butcher and you get so much
meat on each kid one that. I never in

363
00:30:24,56 --> 00:30:29,48
the state where they got money used to
get about seven and six days worth of

364
00:30:29,48 --> 00:30:36,15
married man and i didn't have any kids then
and how do you get the rent and how did

365
00:30:36,15 --> 00:30:40,18
you get the rent. I wasn't in the best
harbor time i think when the bad times i

366
00:30:40,18 --> 00:30:40,62
lived with

367
00:30:40,62 --> 00:30:47,78
a wife's mother. And i was
paying board and i had to take

368
00:30:47,78 --> 00:30:52,42
a lot up and i tell you when i got
the lump sum from the finger with

369
00:30:52,42 --> 00:30:57,23
a very handy. They and what i owed the
lady at those particular day is quite

370
00:30:57,23 --> 00:31:03,08
pleased i get the money back from you £90
that you lost you talk to your finger.

371
00:31:03,45 --> 00:31:09,15
That's right. So i done this odd bit of
good die. Down and miss the finger that

372
00:31:09,15 --> 00:31:14,54
much that tip and i don't a
good turn the way i had to give

373
00:31:14,54 --> 00:31:15,55
a bit of flesh but deny

374
00:31:16,75 --> 00:31:22,84
a pound of flesh it's not. And do you
remember again before the bridge. How many

375
00:31:22,84 --> 00:31:29,73
times we are out of work every
season. You know well i want to

376
00:31:29,73 --> 00:31:36,52
say i i. Just got casual

377
00:31:36,52 --> 00:31:43,35
work. You know just going to work but
i never thought i was in in the john

378
00:31:43,35 --> 00:31:50,31
until three about three years i think well
i you know when pollen wasn't following

379
00:31:50,31 --> 00:31:55,81
me. Trade i think the packers when you
went down to the. The trades hall.

380
00:31:57,44 --> 00:31:58,34
Was that like

381
00:31:58,34 --> 00:32:04,16
a toeing the line arrangement where you
were you sort of lined up for jobs. No in

382
00:32:04,17 --> 00:32:07,36
our in our particular
union was that they had

383
00:32:07,36 --> 00:32:13,75
a book and if they you signed that signed
the book and she was out of work and

384
00:32:13,75 --> 00:32:14,31
