1
00:00:00,45 --> 00:00:06,54
You're going to tell me about the the
fatalities that happened in the in the work

2
00:00:06,54 --> 00:00:12,87
there. There's one in the quarry
quarry. Yes well the other fatality

3
00:00:12,88 --> 00:00:17,66
happened in the face of

4
00:00:17,67 --> 00:00:24,25
a quarry. It seems that they had
the power to monkeys had blasted

5
00:00:24,25 --> 00:00:30,47
a very large mass of granite
and it was balancing

6
00:00:31,46 --> 00:00:37,92
on the quarry ledge and the
quarrymen were working down below

7
00:00:39,22 --> 00:00:39,60
and all of

8
00:00:39,60 --> 00:00:46,52
a sudden that mass of granite
became unbalanced and my shout

9
00:00:46,52 --> 00:00:52,10
went round look out look out and they all
sprang away from the face except one man

10
00:00:52,10 --> 00:00:59,02
who sprang back against the face
and when the stone fell it crushed

11
00:00:59,02 --> 00:01:04,32
him against the face of the quarry. His
name was percy poole. I knew him personally

12
00:01:04,32 --> 00:01:11,03
. Percy poole or my brother in law.
George leslie what now deceased

13
00:01:12,67 --> 00:01:13,19
. He was

14
00:01:13,19 --> 00:01:21,08
a big strong young man of about twenty
six cliff fifteen or sixteen stone quite

15
00:01:21,09 --> 00:01:27,86
like the greek god apollo he picked
percy poole up like this who you know

16
00:01:27,86 --> 00:01:34,30
a ten year old boy picked him up and carried
him down to the dressing station. But

17
00:01:34,30 --> 00:01:41,28
the man was dead. Percy pool. And
another incident was when harry

18
00:01:41,29 --> 00:01:46,92
waters who was a contemporary
of my father. Harry waters had

19
00:01:46,92 --> 00:01:51,48
a job of being a dog man
for a crane a dog man as

20
00:01:51,48 --> 00:01:54,27
a man that fastens

21
00:01:54,28 --> 00:02:00,97
a hooks onto crane loads. And harry waters
used to form the habit of riding on

22
00:02:00,97 --> 00:02:07,71
the courage of the crane rather than
run along after it and i missed this

23
00:02:07,71 --> 00:02:11,65
particular day mr joe wright

24
00:02:11,66 --> 00:02:18,19
a crane driver didn't see harry sitting on
the body of the crane and he swung this

25
00:02:18,20 --> 00:02:24,51
mobile steam crane around and
it crushed. Harry water society

26
00:02:25,60 --> 00:02:31,05
and he died very soon after that. Without
any other incidents like that around the

27
00:02:31,05 --> 00:02:36,84
place anything in the standard thing sheds
no accidents there. Yes yes there's one

28
00:02:36,84 --> 00:02:43,63
now you recall the need of outlining
this. There was one man there. George

29
00:02:43,63 --> 00:02:50,18
walton full blooded scotsman
who used to play the accordion

30
00:02:51,22 --> 00:02:58,09
at the caledonian dances. He
used to for most melodiously and

31
00:02:58,10 --> 00:03:05,05
george walton work just opposite
me and i saw walton had

32
00:03:05,06 --> 00:03:11,74
he had his stone. The granite block it
must have been an eight feet long. He had

33
00:03:11,74 --> 00:03:17,30
the dogs in it and the electrical crane
driver had lifted it up off the ground and

34
00:03:19,23 --> 00:03:25,30
walden wanted to work. What we call the
joints of the stone which meant to say to

35
00:03:25,30 --> 00:03:30,76
put blocks hundreds of stop it from falling
over it was standing up vertically. And

36
00:03:30,76 --> 00:03:31,51
he picked up

37
00:03:31,51 --> 00:03:38,39
a block and instead of catching hold of
the block end for end for safety sake

38
00:03:38,39 --> 00:03:45,11
he forgot. And he put one hand under the
block and the other over the block and

39
00:03:45,12 --> 00:03:49,51
the dogs. Came out the dogs holding to

40
00:03:49,51 --> 00:03:51,97
a block of granite flew out and

41
00:03:53,03 --> 00:03:59,68
a stone fell and caught. Walton's
hand and it crushed his finger off

42
00:03:59,68 --> 00:04:05,84
first finger off to the first joint
now that man he was about sixty five

43
00:04:07,40 --> 00:04:13,74
but he held his hand like so and with
fortitude with fortitude that man of sixty

44
00:04:13,74 --> 00:04:19,89
five. He walked about 400 yards down to
the dressing station to have his crushed

45
00:04:19,89 --> 00:04:26,41
finger dressed. That convinced me
about the fortitude of the scotchman

46
00:04:30,46 --> 00:04:37,28
jim of the men who used to work in the
in the workshops there at the quarry

47
00:04:37,28 --> 00:04:40,33
there who used to sharpen the tools used
to call you call them the tools sharps

48
00:04:40,33 --> 00:04:46,27
they were correctly named
tool shops a blacksmith is

49
00:04:47,02 --> 00:04:52,89
a very capable person tools
sharp is more highly

50
00:04:52,89 --> 00:04:55,63
specialized still because

51
00:04:55,64 --> 00:05:01,14
a blacksmith cannot show cannot
sharpen and temper steel

52
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:12,97
like the professional tool shop
can. But these tools sharps were

53
00:05:12,97 --> 00:05:19,85
the key men of the job. There were about
eight or ten of them and without them

54
00:05:21,23 --> 00:05:21,85
we ran

55
00:05:21,85 --> 00:05:28,49
a pylons would never have been constructed
just those eight or ten men were the key

56
00:05:28,49 --> 00:05:33,71
. Men because they had the skill to temper
the steel to stand up to the granite

57
00:05:33,71 --> 00:05:39,71
chisels and punches and machine chisels
and drills and so forth. They were the

58
00:05:39,71 --> 00:05:45,79
specialized men. And there was one man
in fertik ular richard if you can recall

59
00:05:45,79 --> 00:05:51,37
yourself mckenzie he was a
foreman mckenzie was a us

60
00:05:51,38 --> 00:05:57,19
a man about eleven stone
dark except fellow very

61
00:05:58,05 --> 00:05:59,51
doer to use

62
00:05:59,51 --> 00:06:04,64
a scotch term he boasted of nothing but
there's one thing he did boast of that he

63
00:06:06,57 --> 00:06:09,90
used to temper steel and
punches to stand up to

64
00:06:09,90 --> 00:06:15,63
a granite in scotland called
the brunswick black and it's

65
00:06:15,63 --> 00:06:21,64
a highly impregnated with carbon and very
very hard but this man had successfully

66
00:06:21,64 --> 00:06:27,03
tempered steel to stand up to the
brunswick black and that was his boast

67
00:06:29,10 --> 00:06:33,72
. You know there's no no comparable granite
like that in australia there is there

68
00:06:33,72 --> 00:06:40,16
is we have in this country we have granites
of various colors and including black

69
00:06:41,55 --> 00:06:47,53
and some of the some of the black granite
of this country is as hard as the hobbs

70
00:06:47,53 --> 00:06:48,86
of hell to use

71
00:06:48,86 --> 00:06:55,68
a common expression. The man who sharpened
the tools there and how long did it take

72
00:06:55,68 --> 00:07:00,91
you to wear one down to the point where
it had to be resharpened oh that's an

73
00:07:00,91 --> 00:07:05,72
interesting question. Well that's largely
dependent upon the skill of the tool shop

74
00:07:05,72 --> 00:07:12,61
. So you sometimes tool
shop. Used to air in his

75
00:07:12,61 --> 00:07:19,07
judgment and the tool would either turn out
to brittle and therefore it would crack

76
00:07:19,07 --> 00:07:25,54
and fly or be too soft. But this
used to happen and if it did happen.

77
00:07:26,85 --> 00:07:33,03
All you did was throw that tool away
from your stone into the corridor where

78
00:07:34,40 --> 00:07:38,95
it was from one massive granite chip chip
so your tool over there rejected and we

79
00:07:38,95 --> 00:07:45,06
all did the same and there was a
man employed retired who wasn't

80
00:07:45,06 --> 00:07:49,03
a retired member he was an
ex mason who used to wheel

81
00:07:49,03 --> 00:07:53,42
a barrow up and down the shed collecting
the blunt tools and taking them to

82
00:07:53,42 --> 00:07:58,71
a blacksmith. And each blacksmith had

83
00:07:58,72 --> 00:08:03,47
a way of determining which were his tools
one way or brought back to the blacksmith

84
00:08:03,47 --> 00:08:09,55
shop he would select his chisels and punches
from the pile. I must have had them

85
00:08:09,55 --> 00:08:13,03
branded or some way but he wouldn't it
wouldn't take the blame for the other

86
00:08:13,03 --> 00:08:19,86
fellow's bad work. You know. Yes.
How long did it take you two to

87
00:08:19,86 --> 00:08:21,82
complete one stone. I mean other than

88
00:08:21,82 --> 00:08:26,93
a forty thousand dollars stands on the
hardwood bridge pylons and piers. Now how

89
00:08:26,93 --> 00:08:32,70
long did it take you to complete say one.
Well i don't mind confessing that as an

90
00:08:32,70 --> 00:08:37,46
apprentice. I wasn't expected
to work as laboriously as

91
00:08:37,46 --> 00:08:42,68
a mason on full money but nevertheless
it used to take me five a week to

92
00:08:42,68 --> 00:08:49,25
a fortnight to finish one stone. But down
there. They used to race each other they

93
00:08:49,25 --> 00:08:53,50
were jealous of each other's capacity to
turn these units out you know they use

94
00:08:53,50 --> 00:09:00,36
a race but they was one man there who i
to day think had the right attitude of

95
00:09:00,36 --> 00:09:07,12
mind and his name was kennedy.
Jim kennedy. Jim kennedy was

96
00:09:07,12 --> 00:09:11,75
a man and one of the first men to come
onto the job or jim kennedy another was

97
00:09:11,75 --> 00:09:15,94
george walton had his finger
crossed off and comer on.

98
00:09:18,36 --> 00:09:22,90
Crookshanks jimmy croup shanks and
other. Well this particular man

99
00:09:29,96 --> 00:09:35,54
. Yes jim kennedy her had been a lot
right attitude. It was going to be

100
00:09:35,54 --> 00:09:41,82
a five year contract and jim candy wasn't
going to kill himself he was going to

101
00:09:41,82 --> 00:09:44,21
take it easy. I don't know
the man might have had

102
00:09:44,21 --> 00:09:48,73
a bad heart. I used to think he must have
had because him kennedy used to stand by

103
00:09:48,73 --> 00:09:50,46
his down and have

104
00:09:50,46 --> 00:09:57,20
a gaze around. He worked adlib he
didn't didn't extend himself one bit.

105
00:09:57,26 --> 00:10:04,21
And do contract was finished
on time. You know what sort of

106
00:10:04,21 --> 00:10:09,36
speed. Did the how long did it
take the fastest masons to do

107
00:10:09,36 --> 00:10:15,64
a block. Well i would say one week. One
week there would be the average time of

108
00:10:15,64 --> 00:10:22,14
a mason completing a stone is.
Forty thousand weeks. That's

109
00:10:22,14 --> 00:10:27,86
a lot of weeks is over. Yes yes and
there was one man there apart from

110
00:10:29,41 --> 00:10:34,16
here. Of one day. Q did she go. Apart
from him. There was another fellow called

111
00:10:34,16 --> 00:10:37,56
dizzy low and he was lightly named he was

112
00:10:37,56 --> 00:10:44,54
a six foot man black as the ace
of spades. But tough and they

113
00:10:44,54 --> 00:10:50,61
were the way that man used to belt into
that granite he used to make some of the

114
00:10:50,61 --> 00:10:57,02
other fellows look like apprentices he
was so strong. How many. He absolutely

115
00:10:59,49 --> 00:11:05,41
gloried in beating the other fellow for
these down to the skirts in the some of the

116
00:11:05,41 --> 00:11:08,76
skirts and the italians used to compete
against each other. Did i don't i don't

117
00:11:08,76 --> 00:11:15,12
think so. I don't think so. But what i
mean is me is that the tenacity of the

118
00:11:15,12 --> 00:11:21,73
scottish character. These men were
brought out. And their families and the

119
00:11:21,74 --> 00:11:28,72
average man was past middle
age and yet they used to work

120
00:11:29,82 --> 00:11:36,48
furiously and their their constitutions
i must have had iron constitutions

121
00:11:36,48 --> 00:11:42,94
to work the way they did you hear granite
constitutions. That's the correct word. I

122
00:11:42,94 --> 00:11:43,88
couldn't think of

123
00:11:43,88 --> 00:11:50,29
a granite men they were granite constitutions
yes. Do you remember the manager

124
00:11:50,29 --> 00:11:52,28
there. Mr.

125
00:11:52,29 --> 00:11:59,10
Gilmore. Yes i've already
referred to my interlude with

126
00:11:59,10 --> 00:11:59,55
mr.

127
00:11:59,55 --> 00:12:07,28
John gilmore and his triumph over me. Where
did he live. He lived down the river in

128
00:12:07,28 --> 00:12:09,81
an old historic place

129
00:12:10,75 --> 00:12:16,48
a very beautiful home up on the southern
bank of the river towards the mouth of the

130
00:12:16,48 --> 00:12:22,49
river. It had been the property
of i saw miller name mr.

131
00:12:23,26 --> 00:12:29,87
Arthur ready. But when the sawmill closed
down and norman on long set themselves up

132
00:12:29,87 --> 00:12:34,72
there. This lovely drawing on the side
of the who hill was allocated to mr.

133
00:12:34,72 --> 00:12:41,69
Gilmore and family and there they lived the
full term of the bridge in fact one of

134
00:12:41,69 --> 00:12:46,32
the daughters. I just wrote can't recall
her first name is still occupying that

135
00:12:46,32 --> 00:12:51,63
house. Yeah and and the
company the company supplied

136
00:12:51,63 --> 00:12:58,15
a nice little speedy motor launch that
plied between the quarry and dwelling

137
00:12:58,16 --> 00:13:04,06
for the convenience of the manager and his
family he used to go home for lunch back

138
00:13:04,06 --> 00:13:10,36
and his son jock gilmore. Three
or four years older than i

139
00:13:11,70 --> 00:13:18,13
was the driver of that
launch. So i surmise. But

140
00:13:18,14 --> 00:13:19,91
was getting a retainer

141
00:13:19,91 --> 00:13:26,20
a retainer retainer from the company
to operate that launch. Plus his

142
00:13:26,20 --> 00:13:31,74
meager i emphasize the word his migo
apprenticeship money to supplement that

143
00:13:31,74 --> 00:13:38,12
retainer. I wasn't altogether to wake
up to this when i was an apprentice

144
00:13:38,12 --> 00:13:43,69
didn't cross my mind but i worked it
out since he were born down a maria of

145
00:13:43,69 --> 00:13:45,88
a word you. Yes i am

146
00:13:45,88 --> 00:13:52,73
a native of maria i was born on gun there
lee hill in the year nineteen zero

147
00:13:52,73 --> 00:13:59,15
nine. That makes me seventy
three years of age. I don't

148
00:13:59,15 --> 00:14:06,02
feel seventy three. I don't know whether i
look seventy three. Richard i don't feel

149
00:14:06,02 --> 00:14:11,85
seventy three. But i was born there.
nineteen zero nine. And my father before me

150
00:14:11,85 --> 00:14:17,36
was born in 1873 outside of maria at

151
00:14:17,36 --> 00:14:24,36
a place called do wires creek your
schooldays down there are only

152
00:14:24,36 --> 00:14:31,14
two well. Bob colfax and
i were contemporaries.

153
00:14:31,58 --> 00:14:38,48
We were schoolmates. And bob
cole facts has eulogised the

154
00:14:38,48 --> 00:14:45,25
headmaster whose name was
patrick egan. Bob cole facts

155
00:14:45,25 --> 00:14:51,87
loves to refer to. Patrick egan
as the prince of pedagogues

156
00:14:53,59 --> 00:14:54,45
because he was

157
00:14:54,45 --> 00:15:01,38
a very very well-informed man and had

158
00:15:01,39 --> 00:15:08,39
the art of teaching and these success
that he had with his pupils namely

159
00:15:08,40 --> 00:15:15,19
bursary bursary attainments was amazing
and all the colfax family in fact when i

160
00:15:15,19 --> 00:15:21,94
say all there are one two three boys and
two girls all attain bursaries under the

161
00:15:21,94 --> 00:15:28,69
instruction of egan. And bob
colfax for the satisfaction of

162
00:15:28,69 --> 00:15:35,07
posterity i refer them to bob cole faxes
story memory lane in which he elaborates

163
00:15:35,07 --> 00:15:38,62
on his school days at maria as

164
00:15:38,62 --> 00:15:43,18
a matter of fact bob colfax
recently supplied me with

165
00:15:43,18 --> 00:15:49,36
a manuscript outlining it.
It all and i typed that

166
00:15:49,36 --> 00:15:52,47
manuscript out and i'm about to send

167
00:15:52,47 --> 00:15:59,11
a copy of it. Plus the manuscript back
to colfax in maria. But i have had

168
00:16:00,30 --> 00:16:05,79
a friend of mine read that
manuscript and she she's

169
00:16:05,80 --> 00:16:10,63
a native of the south coast and she's truly
amazed at how cold facts and aberrated

170
00:16:10,63 --> 00:16:17,50
on the system of education that
was afforded we children of those

171
00:16:17,50 --> 00:16:23,94
days period and it was a good education.
It was excellent. It was marvelous. As

172
00:16:23,94 --> 00:16:29,18
a matter of fact when you reached fifth
and sixth class you were receiving

173
00:16:29,18 --> 00:16:34,91
secondary school education secondary
school education such subjects as

174
00:16:37,07 --> 00:16:42,40
trigonometry algebra quadratic equations

175
00:16:44,33 --> 00:16:49,72
and all the higher branches of education
were imparted to us by patrick egan in

176
00:16:49,72 --> 00:16:54,69
fifth and sixth class. How many teachers
were there at the school. There were about

177
00:16:54,69 --> 00:17:01,34
three lady teachers and one man. Patrick
egan and that took you up to high school

178
00:17:01,34 --> 00:17:06,65
to this. Yes the fifth and sixth class but
took it up to high school standard in

179
00:17:06,65 --> 00:17:11,86
fact one of the call faxes gord
on that's bob's brother. He got

180
00:17:11,86 --> 00:17:18,74
a super duper pass in the bursary
which entitled him to go straight

181
00:17:18,74 --> 00:17:22,35
to high school when he came
to sydney and that gordon is

182
00:17:22,35 --> 00:17:29,23

Do you have anything else about

186
00:17:46,24 --> 00:17:49,07
. Maria in those days. Do you. While

187
00:17:54,03 --> 00:18:00,63
some of the most inspiring days
of my life were spelt spent

188
00:18:01,39 --> 00:18:08,22
on my native soil and i remember

189
00:18:08,22 --> 00:18:09,43
i was a bit of

190
00:18:09,43 --> 00:18:18,07
a loner and i used to roam around
the countryside by myself and

191
00:18:18,08 --> 00:18:22,76
i remember one day. I thought
to myself i go and have

192
00:18:22,76 --> 00:18:29,11
a look at brown leave the island which
has been written up by the state

193
00:18:29,12 --> 00:18:35,50
historian and i walked down to the mouth
of the marina river which is about

194
00:18:36,61 --> 00:18:43,41
five mile five mile and i walked three mile
along the beach to brownlee island and

195
00:18:43,41 --> 00:18:49,49
all by myself and walked through the
bush by the time i got back home i musta

196
00:18:49,49 --> 00:18:56,23
covered about twenty miles. And i was
so thirsty that i didn't have the

197
00:18:57,62 --> 00:19:02,54
the good sense to go and ask a resident for
a drink of water. I had a drink out of

198
00:19:02,54 --> 00:19:07,96
a horse trough. I drank the water out of
the horse trough that's how thirsty i was

199
00:19:10,63 --> 00:19:14,47
. Can you think of any other stories
about maria. Richard a very dramatic

200
00:19:15,35 --> 00:19:22,10
a very dramatic episode i shall relate.
My father. Was in the habit of

201
00:19:22,10 --> 00:19:25,19
visiting his brother who was

202
00:19:25,19 --> 00:19:31,49
a farmer and my father used to
take we for children with him.

203
00:19:32,53 --> 00:19:33,38
And after having had

204
00:19:33,38 --> 00:19:40,08
a lovely day on the farm. My father would
help his brother milk the cows and we

205
00:19:40,08 --> 00:19:45,41
would sit around the table and
have our evening meal and we would

206
00:19:47,41 --> 00:19:54,27
start to wind our way home after dark. We

207
00:19:54,28 --> 00:20:00,100
had to cross the river. That is to say
that my father's brother used to go

208
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,97
down to the river with us and row us across
the river. And row the boat back to his

209
00:20:07,97 --> 00:20:14,16
side and from that point we used to
depart and go across the hills to

210
00:20:14,16 --> 00:20:20,12
a distant. Farming locality further
up the river named cairo or

211
00:20:21,78 --> 00:20:28,35
we lived at kai or well my
father got up into the hills and

212
00:20:28,36 --> 00:20:29,26
he was

213
00:20:29,26 --> 00:20:35,78
a very good bushman and he knew the country
like i knew the back of his hand but

214
00:20:35,79 --> 00:20:36,18
this was

215
00:20:36,18 --> 00:20:43,27
a very dark night and my
father missed his way and at

216
00:20:43,27 --> 00:20:50,23
a certain point and i father said
don't move and he was carrying

217
00:20:50,23 --> 00:20:57,22
my youngest sister in his arms he said
don't move and we all stopped dead

218
00:20:59,30 --> 00:21:05,25
and my father became more
fully aware of his situation

219
00:21:07,30 --> 00:21:14,24
and richard the dramatic incident
i am about to state is my

220
00:21:14,24 --> 00:21:16,95
father was standing on the edge of

221
00:21:17,70 --> 00:21:24,64
a mine shaft. One step further. My
father would have been down the shaft

222
00:21:24,64 --> 00:21:30,60
with his youngest child in his
arms. Now i often say to myself

223
00:21:32,54 --> 00:21:37,48
there something in that
shakespearian quotation. There is

224
00:21:37,48 --> 00:21:41,62
a dead divinity which
shapes our ends. There is

225
00:21:41,62 --> 00:21:48,31
a destiny or divinity which shapes our
ends rough few them out. We will my father

226
00:21:48,31 --> 00:21:51,30
was between life and death at
that moment but something had

227
00:21:51,30 --> 00:21:54,51
a presentiment. And he said stop.
