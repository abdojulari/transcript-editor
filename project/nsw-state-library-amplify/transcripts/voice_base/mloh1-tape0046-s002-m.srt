00:02:26,79 --> 00:02:33,32
in your union. No no you is involved with
the trade unions you know you so i know

32
00:02:33,32 --> 00:02:33,49

a trade y'all delegate at that mp the mp
because depend on the change union for

34
00:02:39,27 --> 00:02:40,76
their support. Is

35
00:02:40,76 --> 00:02:43,71
a city council but also i notice that he
was also i think the secretary at that

36
00:02:43,71 --> 00:02:48,33
time but he was also chairman of the
disputes committee because i heard his name

37
00:02:48,33 --> 00:02:52,16
mentioned i read the harbour bridge. I'm
not too sure he might i mean you know i

38
00:02:52,16 --> 00:02:54,13
mean i do good. He might have been

39
00:02:54,13 --> 00:02:58,14
a member but he was interested in the
union movement and it was him that had

40
00:02:58,14 --> 00:03:03,60
a meeting about the unemployed and that's
why the unemployed sold them back as

41
00:03:03,60 --> 00:03:06,57
others. You know happened to me i didn't
know that the meat and tell you that you

42
00:03:07,78 --> 00:03:13,24
die happen to be in the room when they
brought the book in and i said no i'm not

43
00:03:13,24 --> 00:03:19,11
lose anything but you know now so i put
my name down and that's what happened and

44
00:03:19,11 --> 00:03:23,45
when you left the bridge. You went back on
store and packing were you on the dole.

45
00:03:23,56 --> 00:03:30,29
Then after the bridge. No i don't
think so. I. I think i got i got

46
00:03:30,29 --> 00:03:33,97
back on dive straight into
the straight into the

47
00:03:38,73 --> 00:03:45,57
stall and packers. And i you know

48
00:03:45,57 --> 00:03:50,08
could got enough casual work to keep me
going till i actually i got a job with

49
00:03:50,08 --> 00:03:56,95
a well company then i would pollute less
your company in nineteen. Thirty five. I

50
00:03:56,95 --> 00:04:03,47
think and i was there for up to 1960 for.
That's where i don't or my best part of

51
00:04:03,47 --> 00:04:09,33
my work was at the shelter and.
fifty fifty odd years for them.

52
00:04:11,04 --> 00:04:17,28
Eight years at least i'm sorry. Twenty
eight twenty eight. Now you know and

53
00:04:19,48 --> 00:04:24,58
then i got kicked out how to retire
when i was sixty. I happened to get

54
00:04:24,58 --> 00:04:27,83
a job i was living that
manly of a time and i got

55
00:04:27,83 --> 00:04:32,39
a job. I'm in the council of the cleaner
office cleaner and i put five years as

56
00:04:32,39 --> 00:04:35,32
office cleaner and when i
became sixty five i had

57
00:04:35,32 --> 00:04:42,13
a retired sixty five of the at the
council. So i've been retired ever since

58
00:04:42,13 --> 00:04:49,02
i think sixty nine live on the pension.

59
00:04:49,04 --> 00:04:53,69
So looking back what was it like. What
you're of impressions looking back at the

60
00:04:53,69 --> 00:04:59,15
time when you were working on the bridge
approach as best thing i can think of that

61
00:04:59,15 --> 00:05:04,93
it was you know me a job well as doing

62
00:05:04,94 --> 00:05:07,74
a thing that was necessary for the state

63
00:05:07,75 --> 00:05:12,49
a large country at large with the bridge.
I thought myself you know been built. You

64
00:05:12,49 --> 00:05:12,56
know

65
00:05:13,33 --> 00:05:19,65
a long while before there and i mean on
the north side and close to it. It meant

66
00:05:19,65 --> 00:05:26,22
a lot to us and those days but i just
before i got the job i got married and

67
00:05:27,64 --> 00:05:32,54
i turned that bad policy to be able to
work. You know fairly when you just start

68
00:05:32,54 --> 00:05:39,33
north. You know yeah. Get down together and
i was quite happy to have the job done

69
00:05:39,33 --> 00:05:44,90
without you know how tough it was and i
don't regret anything that happened. I

70
00:05:44,90 --> 00:05:50,95
happy time i got on all of the men or i
than the gang is alright and i'm quite

71
00:05:50,95 --> 00:05:53,47
happy. Tell me what did you do for

72
00:05:53,47 --> 00:05:56,08
a recreation those days where
do you go when you had

73
00:05:56,08 --> 00:06:03,02
a bit of time off and bit of money
there. Pocket. Two there used to be

74
00:06:03,02 --> 00:06:09,22
around you know around different places
to get in and day out to you know. Go

75
00:06:09,22 --> 00:06:12,80
around you wouldn't get they think by wait
on the paper you have to get around ask

76
00:06:12,80 --> 00:06:13,40
people if they want

77
00:06:13,40 --> 00:06:17,96
a new no they you know. Do you did you
find no did you have no recreation. Do you

78
00:06:17,96 --> 00:06:20,92
not sport is dancing is one of

79
00:06:20,92 --> 00:06:24,68
a hot day is in town. You could or
dickens under the main bar and have

80
00:06:24,68 --> 00:06:30,03
a swim and something like that. You know
and play card mostly wait and wait to get

81
00:06:30,03 --> 00:06:30,66

82
00:06:30,66 --> 00:06:37,57
a recreation you know at you anyway.

83
00:06:37,57 --> 00:06:41,21

with the work it was to try to get there

84
00:06:41,21 --> 00:06:43,30
as i know i would never really it's

85
00:06:43,30 --> 00:06:46,12
a challenge. You know father might have
you know gone if i was that way inclined

86
00:06:46,12 --> 00:06:52,95

mean you can't remember any any

87
00:06:52,95 --> 00:06:58,35

you think you know bird's eye view of the
bridge as you go on over and the place i

123
00:09:54,81 --> 00:09:58,24
lived in greenwich and was you get

124
00:09:58,24 --> 00:10:02,35
a look across the water. You see the
bridge i you know it's all aspects of the

125
00:10:02,35 --> 00:10:06,02
bridge. Actually you
know go up so you have

126
00:10:06,02 --> 00:10:10,59
a little business on the side while you
were working on the richard you know and

127
00:10:10,59 --> 00:10:16,25
after that was when i was out of work i
was about before i started on the bridge

128
00:10:16,25 --> 00:10:23,10
that was only about eighteen or
nineteen i fail and i and that

129
00:10:23,10 --> 00:10:27,92
deal in the time. How do you go with the
business. Oh i would make your ports and

130
00:10:27,92 --> 00:10:32,38

money and i think that time you know

131
00:10:32,38 --> 00:10:38,39
people about what a lot
for nothing and they had

132
00:10:38,39 --> 00:10:44,11
a mate and. He was i mean out of work
and we had to go the fish market we buy

133
00:10:44,11 --> 00:10:48,99
a case of fish you get a filleted and we
go up the north shore line and we'd have

134
00:10:48,99 --> 00:10:54,89
a nice white and then we'll try and of white
cloth over the wall walk. You'd spend

135
00:10:54,89 --> 00:11:00,33
your money and walk all day they affairs
and fire and the end they are your fate x

136
00:11:00,33 --> 00:11:07,04

like down there when there's that time.

139
00:11:22,56 --> 00:11:28,99
Oh granny beautiful but it's right on the
river. The bottom part you know in the

140
00:11:28,99 --> 00:11:32,96
top other top part of greenish
looks down but all down

141
00:11:32,96 --> 00:11:36,50
a very quiet flat when i was
here and they live and up

142
00:11:36,50 --> 00:11:40,84
a bit down and i went mad shop for yourself
to go to crow's nest to do her job in

143
00:11:40,84 --> 00:11:45,53
the most shops you know crone out and used
to walk across the wheels and can't get

144
00:11:45,53 --> 00:11:48,71
work at us. I think i think it's a change
that are going to settle in we had

145
00:11:48,71 --> 00:11:55,39
a bus going from glenys to
point to some lenders and

146
00:11:55,40 --> 00:12:00,41
then we had the oil or oil workers at the
bottom of greenedge road and usually in

147
00:12:00,41 --> 00:12:02,23
the early part used to be

148
00:12:02,23 --> 00:12:06,70
a lot of traffic that i mean you know not
going to or for you to walk up the street

149
00:12:06,70 --> 00:12:11,67
and you know what your first move there
because of the because their oil company.

155
00:12:39,91 --> 00:12:46,29

157
00:12:54,05 --> 00:13:00,24

00:13:01,30 --> 00:13:05,61
And wages were a bit i think
of work and you know wages

159
00:13:05,61 --> 00:13:12,35
a bit higher than you know for the full
time found no today. That that's you know

160
00:13:14,17 --> 00:13:19,37
and when you were on the bridge was it the
same pay for £4 all the way through and

161
00:13:19,38 --> 00:13:24,86
there's more. And if there's more i think
in fiji i think we've got about eight. We

162
00:13:24,87 --> 00:13:29,72
have a rationed a we have a
ration if we i'm. Three days

163
00:13:29,72 --> 00:13:34,58
a week. I think it was on food only. On
the bridge on the beach approach here.

164
00:13:36,67 --> 00:13:42,40
In time for real bad. And then they gradually
put you on for more days of the week

165
00:13:42,40 --> 00:13:46,31
when things got better. We don't full
time when you know when they will get no

166
00:13:46,31 --> 00:13:53,20
finish an uplift rage and i was lucky that
at the finish. I got kept on quite the

167
00:13:53,20 --> 00:13:57,97
majority and got put off you know when the
bridge opened that i you know the job

168
00:13:57,97 --> 00:14:03,03
the gang we were doing the gardening
work their grass and all of the you know

169
00:14:03,03 --> 00:14:08,81
bottom part of the bridge and the waterfront
down that way. Doing up the streets

170
00:14:08,81 --> 00:14:12,83
and things like that and
eventually i. I got

171
00:14:16,11 --> 00:14:21,31
i had to go look for more different
feels that i ended up and i end up in

172
00:14:21,31 --> 00:14:27,82
a regular job at the finish and go. Can
you tell something about the casual.

173
00:14:29,91 --> 00:14:34,11
Store and packer's job from the point of
view of the wool stores exactly did they

174
00:14:34,11 --> 00:14:34,30
have

175
00:14:34,30 --> 00:14:39,26
a pool of casual labour all the time they
have many current many permanents i know

176
00:14:39,26 --> 00:14:45,82
i was all stores. Oh they have quite a few
but nothing like the staff they've got

177
00:14:45,82 --> 00:14:51,58
a handle on the seasons on. And when
the spurs are all stores is concerned.

178
00:14:52,62 --> 00:14:57,64
Nina as soon as the season starts. Well
that's when they start to employ casual

179
00:14:57,65 --> 00:15:01,11
labour and if they there's
men casual work as

180
00:15:01,11 --> 00:15:05,27
a follow other particular stores up and
they report to see if they can get

181
00:15:05,27 --> 00:15:11,30
a job if they're out of work and if the
wheels stores can't get anybody to

182
00:15:12,08 --> 00:15:12,55
approach them for

183
00:15:12,55 --> 00:15:19,49
a job they just ring up the wall stall
the stall and back as union and you all

184
00:15:19,49 --> 00:15:23,02
still and takers union jenny got
a good list of men looking for

185
00:15:23,02 --> 00:15:26,63
a job and so they sent
around and this applies in

186
00:15:26,63 --> 00:15:29,49
a lot of what they call someone
up gang want to say after

187
00:15:29,49 --> 00:15:36,07
a sale of all there's two hundred and
hundreds of bales it's been opened up in the

188
00:15:36,07 --> 00:15:41,94
top and been speculated by the buyer and
the wolves will be put back into the in

189
00:15:41,94 --> 00:15:47,92
the bales and sign up and that's what they
call the sowers sewing up game and these

190
00:15:47,92 --> 00:15:52,26
chaps floyd on a casual basis and
they might only get one or two days

191
00:15:53,19 --> 00:15:59,30
a week and they go from store to store.
Wherever the sales on but another part of

192
00:15:59,30 --> 00:16:04,100
the wool game is the dumping will dumping
when i say they dumped all the shipping

193
00:16:05,75 --> 00:16:11,10
and in this particular
case. The conditions are

194
00:16:12,64 --> 00:16:17,20
a lot of harder. Not a lot harder
work and in lots of cases there's

195
00:16:17,20 --> 00:16:24,06
a lot of machine as men working dumps
dumping machines and they need experience

196
00:16:24,07 --> 00:16:30,52
workers and so on the job last longer and

197
00:16:30,53 --> 00:16:31,93
when these people get

198
00:16:31,93 --> 00:16:37,01
a job they start off and do it and
if the job if the ship is sailing

199
00:16:37,96 --> 00:16:43,02
a certain time might knesset say they work
all day work all day and all night too.

200
00:16:43,02 --> 00:16:44,60
And these chaps are on

201
00:16:44,60 --> 00:16:49,99
a fair fair wage that they get because the
same rate. I saw at the saddest day. So

202
00:16:50,00 --> 00:16:56,18
is up get but it's more along the job. And

203
00:16:57,54 --> 00:17:03,29
if you can see the distance out and at the
end of a one ship. You can earn quite

204
00:17:03,29 --> 00:17:08,93
a lot of money and it's just like
the wharfies. In those days was

205
00:17:08,93 --> 00:17:12,74
a still dave and that's why they would
say they work a ship they get a job on

206
00:17:12,74 --> 00:17:19,15
a boat and they work so much overtime and
work all night and if you work all night

207
00:17:19,15 --> 00:17:21,16
. Well natalie and
that's a break. They get

208
00:17:21,16 --> 00:17:28,16
a fair whack of money and. As far
as i was concerned them day i

209
00:17:28,16 --> 00:17:32,20
was prepared to work because after i
finish the job. I know there were no other

210
00:17:32,20 --> 00:17:37,41
work that go to and i could
recuperate fool. I think we sell for

211
00:17:39,05 --> 00:17:44,43
the casual workers and entitled to all the
money they can get because when you're

212
00:17:44,43 --> 00:17:48,72
out looking for a job you you're not
paid and they're think and that's only

213
00:17:48,72 --> 00:17:52,48
a very very tired you've if you
work one block and you know into

214
00:17:52,48 --> 00:17:56,82
a couple of place and ask if they want
their labor and they say you know i do it

215
00:17:56,82 --> 00:18:01,61
you get tired very quick and decide that
and and tell me how long did you have to

216
00:18:01,61 --> 00:18:08,45
be off work in order to qualify for the
dole. I thought night i think those days so

217
00:18:08,45 --> 00:18:10,98
you could pick up a couple of days
work and that it is qualify you for

218
00:18:10,98 --> 00:18:14,88
a fortnight from getting the dole.
Now you know if you had a sign

219
00:18:14,88 --> 00:18:19,29
a declaration that you never earned certain
amount of time that your work there was

220
00:18:19,29 --> 00:18:22,48
an amount of money or do
you have any trouble with

221
00:18:22,48 --> 00:18:26,50
a dull inspectors on that sort of thing.
Now i now know i never cheated. Not much

222
00:18:26,50 --> 00:18:32,94
anyway. You know come across
inspectors at that time

223
00:18:33,94 --> 00:18:37,55
know gaza and. Do you ever get in

224
00:18:37,55 --> 00:18:43,93
a position where you faced eviction from
you know for me has always treated or i

225
00:18:43,93 --> 00:18:48,98
lie. And the mother in law holds out at
one stage mother all they'll be out and i

226
00:18:48,98 --> 00:18:49,28
played

227
00:18:49,28 --> 00:18:57,18
a half and one landlord and i. When i
moved from granny to i owed him. $5 and

228
00:18:57,19 --> 00:19:03,71
. I moved i said i'd pay more and when i
went oh man. The only way i haven't i

229
00:19:03,71 --> 00:19:07,34
would have a win in the no
lottery and i won a ten. I think

230
00:19:07,34 --> 00:19:11,95
a lot and i said he. The fiver in the us
quite happy in the very thought he'd ever

231
00:19:11,95 --> 00:19:12,87
get the five aleck.
