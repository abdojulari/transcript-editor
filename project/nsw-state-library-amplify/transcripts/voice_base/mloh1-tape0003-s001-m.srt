1
00:00:05,68 --> 00:00:06,31
I'm talking to mr.

2
00:00:06,31 --> 00:00:12,06
Bob cold facts who worked at the maria
quarry and also up in sydney on the pylons

3
00:00:12,06 --> 00:00:15,30
during the building of the sydney harbour
bridge. Do you remember how you first got

4
00:00:15,30 --> 00:00:21,96
your job. Mr folks. Yes. I was
born and educated in maria and

5
00:00:21,96 --> 00:00:27,77
i went off to high school in sydney. When
i was twelve years of age and from there

6
00:00:27,77 --> 00:00:28,65
on i was

7
00:00:28,65 --> 00:00:34,15
a long time away from maria and very homesick
for it all the time i was working for

8
00:00:34,15 --> 00:00:37,66
the irrigation commission
in griffith and i had

9
00:00:37,66 --> 00:00:42,30
a very good job and i was advancing well
in the job. But i was offered the job at

10
00:00:42,30 --> 00:00:48,00
maria quarry and because i was so terribly
homesick. I threw aside this permanent

11
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:48,53
job with

12
00:00:48,53 --> 00:00:53,72
a great prospect and came down to work at
the meru your quarry at the end of 1924.

13
00:00:54,81 --> 00:00:59,26
What was your job there at the quarry ms
twelve. I was general clark in the quarry

14
00:00:59,26 --> 00:01:06,24
and my father was the timekeeper.
And what did your job entail my job

15
00:01:06,24 --> 00:01:12,69
entailed the preparation of cost
records and some correspondence and

16
00:01:13,98 --> 00:01:20,67
the management of some of the stores
records and all kinds of returns that the

17
00:01:20,67 --> 00:01:24,71
company required weekly and anything of

18
00:01:24,71 --> 00:01:31,48
a general nature that was required to be
done in the office there. How many people

19
00:01:31,48 --> 00:01:36,43
worked at the quarry. Well when i was
there the maximum number was two hundred

20
00:01:36,43 --> 00:01:43,31
forty. Two hundred forty

21
00:01:43,31 --> 00:01:50,15
years. That was the maximum when rollman
and men were paid weekly i was paid

22
00:01:50,15 --> 00:01:55,70
clerk as well. I forgot to say previously.
And the men were paid weekly and the

23
00:01:56,52 --> 00:02:01,46
amount of money. The total money for the
power. All right. Approximately fifteen

24
00:02:01,46 --> 00:02:03,70
hundred pounds a week was

25
00:02:03,71 --> 00:02:09,96
a stable workforce of 250 or was it more
or less now that was stable at the time i

26
00:02:09,96 --> 00:02:13,85
was there you know what they did the
various numbers of the various jobs. Well

27
00:02:13,85 --> 00:02:17,58
there were ninety stone masons which was
of course they were the principal members

28
00:02:17,58 --> 00:02:22,96
of the workforce and then of course the
requirement to get the root stone out and

29
00:02:22,96 --> 00:02:27,55
then the first part of the
quarry workings. They had

30
00:02:27,56 --> 00:02:32,59
a huge crashing plant where they broke up
the ground balls and converted it into

31
00:02:33,69 --> 00:02:38,58
aggregate for making the concrete for the
building of the piers and the pile and.

32
00:02:39,21 --> 00:02:44,83
Do you memo how many workers there were in
the quarry end of things. Well as i said

33
00:02:44,83 --> 00:02:47,99
there were ninety stone
masons and i would say just

34
00:02:47,99 --> 00:02:53,78
a quick guess would be up to say twelve
quarryman but then of course the auxilary

35
00:02:53,79 --> 00:02:59,28
men such as quite a few labourers
powder monkey and then of course we had

36
00:02:59,28 --> 00:03:05,40
a huge power house there and there were
the engineers and we had we had to

37
00:03:05,40 --> 00:03:05,89
construct

38
00:03:05,89 --> 00:03:09,94
a water supply for the quarry and also for
the village that was subsequently built

39
00:03:09,94 --> 00:03:16,90
there for the workmen and we had
carpenters and so forth. We had. We had. A

40
00:03:16,90 --> 00:03:18,56
plumber and practically

41
00:03:18,56 --> 00:03:24,94
a reclassification of. Tradesmen that you
could nominate electrician. Yes you know

42
00:03:24,94 --> 00:03:29,81
. Did you remember the building of the great
town america. Oh i remember that very

43
00:03:29,81 --> 00:03:36,76
well they constructed sixty seven
cottages. There were about six

44
00:03:36,76 --> 00:03:42,85
three room cottages and all the rest were
forum cottages and i can recollect that

45
00:03:42,85 --> 00:03:45,98
we got all the hardwood timber
from mitchell brothers and

46
00:03:45,98 --> 00:03:52,13
a rumour and it only cost twenty shillings
four hundred superficial feet at that

47
00:03:52,13 --> 00:03:56,00
particular time. You know what happened
to those cottages after they were removed

48
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:00,98
from the. They were they were sold. I
wasn't there when they were sold but i know

49
00:04:00,98 --> 00:04:06,59
that they were sold properly by auction.
And of course the terms of sale was that

50
00:04:06,59 --> 00:04:12,67
the purchaser dismantle the cottage and
take it away and they were they were built

51
00:04:14,41 --> 00:04:21,28
as they stood previously in many different
parts and of course the total of

52
00:04:21,28 --> 00:04:27,44
the material was used to build bigger
buildings but as well as the duplication of

53
00:04:27,44 --> 00:04:33,21
the buildings as they originally were as
far north as ulladulla. I've seen some

54
00:04:33,21 --> 00:04:36,88
aboriginals who claim that they're living
in cottages it already in point which we

55
00:04:36,88 --> 00:04:41,50
came from the bridge. I don't know. It's
quite possible. It's quite possible. Yes.

56
00:04:42,46 --> 00:04:45,77
Can you remember anything else that happened
while you were at the quarry anything

57
00:04:45,77 --> 00:04:50,92
particular. You know but the fatalities
for instance i can remember the first

58
00:04:50,92 --> 00:04:56,63
battalion it was a man. A native of
maria called harry waters and he was

59
00:04:56,63 --> 00:05:03,01
a crane chaser for travelling locomotive
steam crane and this crane had

60
00:05:03,01 --> 00:05:06,40
a huge counterweight on it
and it could swing around in

61
00:05:06,40 --> 00:05:12,92
a circle of 360 degrees and he was sitting
on the carriage and instead of walking

62
00:05:12,92 --> 00:05:18,86
along. He's taking an easy ride on the
carriage of the crane and not observing that

63
00:05:18,86 --> 00:05:23,03
this huge counterweight was swinging around
and it practically tragedies like he

64
00:05:23,04 --> 00:05:27,11
was taken to the hospital but he only
survived for two or three days and the other

65
00:05:27,11 --> 00:05:30,08
fatality was a quarryman called
percy poole also although

66
00:05:30,08 --> 00:05:35,00
a local man from maria. He
went in to recover some tools

67
00:05:37,46 --> 00:05:40,63
. In a huge crevice that had
been created from blasting out

68
00:05:41,93 --> 00:05:46,60
a tremendous piece of granite and he went
into this crevice to recover some tools

69
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:53,65
and as he did so. The huge piece of granite
decided to slide and fill the crevice

70
00:05:53,65 --> 00:05:57,76
up and he was crushed to death and they
were the only two fatalities that happened

71
00:05:57,76 --> 00:06:02,11
. Maria quarry and i noticed their names
are recorded on the list of patel it is up

72
00:06:02,12 --> 00:06:05,63
on the harbour bridge itself on the
plaque up there. That is correct and i've

73
00:06:05,63 --> 00:06:08,91
checked that out in the morgue registers
and suchlike and it tallies exactly with

74
00:06:08,91 --> 00:06:15,00
what what do you say yes
yes indeed. There were

75
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:21,87
a great number of scotch people there of
course imported. Being stone masons and

76
00:06:21,87 --> 00:06:25,21
quarryman mainly and therefore there was

77
00:06:25,21 --> 00:06:29,48
a local caledonian society and maria.
And there were functions every week

78
00:06:29,48 --> 00:06:33,75
caledonian society functions and
scotch dances and the like and where

79
00:06:33,75 --> 00:06:38,22
a very merry time was invariably had
by all they were certainly they merge

80
00:06:38,22 --> 00:06:42,88
marvelously with their local maroon
community and they were the golden years of

81
00:06:42,88 --> 00:06:47,54
merari of the cash flow and free and everyone
was happy and merry and prosperous of

82
00:06:47,55 --> 00:06:51,59
the italians there. Yes i remember the
italians i can't tell you exactly the number

83
00:06:51,59 --> 00:06:56,99
that they are but they are all stone masons
i'd say and they the company built them

84
00:06:56,99 --> 00:07:01,08
quarters of their own and they had their
own cook there that prepared the meals for

85
00:07:01,08 --> 00:07:01,30
them.
