1
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:10,39
Where.

2
00:00:11,55 --> 00:00:18,49
Like birthing yes.

3
00:00:19,73 --> 00:00:26,11
It's hard to go home. Birthing was
another aspect of this vision.

4
00:00:26,13 --> 00:00:31,83
I mean we were really looking
at. Cradle to the grave.

5
00:00:31,85 --> 00:00:35,66
And so women were.

6
00:00:37,44 --> 00:00:42,00
Dissatisfied with the present with
the situation as it was then.

7
00:00:43,14 --> 00:00:47,52
They wanted to birth their children in a.

8
00:00:47,98 --> 00:00:52,88
In a loving nonclinical atmosphere.

9
00:00:53,09 --> 00:00:59,89
They didn't want birthing to be considered
a case for hospitals. It was really a.

10
00:01:01,18 --> 00:01:07,36
To be seen as a natural thing. And in many
cases there was no need for hospitals.

11
00:01:07,38 --> 00:01:10,46
I mean it was still recognized
that hospitals had their place.

12
00:01:10,51 --> 00:01:15,07
If something went wrong. So.

13
00:01:16,38 --> 00:01:21,28
So home birthing became
very strong movement here.

14
00:01:22,49 --> 00:01:24,80
Run by women who are having children

15
00:01:25,62 --> 00:01:29,17
and those women as they
their children grew up

16
00:01:29,99 --> 00:01:33,39
or their energies went somewhere
else were replaced by other women

17
00:01:34,24 --> 00:01:38,42
and that's continued to this day.

18
00:01:39,68 --> 00:01:44,21
So that's birthing then education.

19
00:01:44,22 --> 00:01:49,82
I think i mentioned earlier that
we started the community school.

20
00:01:49,84 --> 00:01:51,88
People were really
concerned with education

21
00:01:51,88 --> 00:01:58,74
that children weren't being educated
in the broad enough. You know in a.

22
00:02:00,78 --> 00:02:05,01
Non regimented.

23
00:02:05,03 --> 00:02:08,54
More flexible way.

24
00:02:09,38 --> 00:02:12,41
And so we set up our own schools and.

25
00:02:15,28 --> 00:02:22,26
We also started to see
the whole of all the

26
00:02:22,26 --> 00:02:25,42
activities in the area
as part of our education

27
00:02:26,34 --> 00:02:30,59
and our children's education
it was a sort of a.

28
00:02:30,61 --> 00:02:33,92
A university of life.

29
00:02:35,77 --> 00:02:39,08
And so people would hold workshops

30
00:02:39,08 --> 00:02:45,24
and people would visit each other's
places to learn different crafts.

31
00:02:45,25 --> 00:02:51,47
We were probably a little earthier then
than we are now. It was very much.

32
00:02:51,52 --> 00:02:55,76
Back to the land. And while that's
still a very strong element.

33
00:02:56,07 --> 00:03:02,79
Now there's a lot of diversification
and a lot of other interests as well.

34
00:03:05,60 --> 00:03:11,62
So there was education the
university of life in the field.

35
00:03:11,64 --> 00:03:17,67
Practical sort of learning.

36
00:03:17,69 --> 00:03:24,45
I've lost the thread.
What else can i tell you.

37
00:03:28,11 --> 00:03:34,32
Right right. Ok ok.

38
00:03:35,34 --> 00:03:35,53
Yeah.

39
00:03:37,73 --> 00:03:43,37
So another aspect of of the
values was the way we live.

40
00:03:45,43 --> 00:03:47,31
What sort of houses we lived in.

41
00:03:49,67 --> 00:03:51,25
You know how we did our gardens

42
00:03:51,25 --> 00:03:56,82
and how we integrated
outside with inside so.

43
00:03:56,84 --> 00:04:00,82
Because of the economic
circumstances. Much as anything else.

44
00:04:01,32 --> 00:04:06,03
There was a whole range
of innovative ideas

45
00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:09,06
that flowed into the building
the field of building.

46
00:04:09,59 --> 00:04:16,31
And people were very
conscious of passive solar

47
00:04:16,31 --> 00:04:19,16
design use of.

48
00:04:19,17 --> 00:04:25,30
Benign materials materials
that were ecologically sound.

49
00:04:26,47 --> 00:04:33,42
And use the lot of recycled materials
things that were at that time.

50
00:04:34,22 --> 00:04:36,65
Very much undervalued. You know.

51
00:04:36,96 --> 00:04:43,44
Buildings would get demolished
and the timber would get burnt.

52
00:04:43,45 --> 00:04:50,16
So people put together houses
using a whole range of these

53
00:04:50,16 --> 00:04:53,01
different materials.

54
00:04:54,57 --> 00:05:00,59
People build houses that
were open plan and.

55
00:05:00,61 --> 00:05:03,90
A lot of use of lofts.

56
00:05:03,92 --> 00:05:12,51
Lots of verandas borrowing from
traditional straight in country style.

57
00:05:14,64 --> 00:05:18,12
Lots of use of. Alternate energy.

58
00:05:19,12 --> 00:05:23,19
Many of these houses were located on
properties that were way off the grid.

59
00:05:24,09 --> 00:05:28,37
So there's no power no water. No services.

60
00:05:29,69 --> 00:05:35,94
So people began to. Use.

61
00:05:36,80 --> 00:05:43,11
Solar panels with battery banks.

62
00:05:43,13 --> 00:05:48,04
For their 12 volt systems to power
their lights and their sound systems

63
00:05:48,04 --> 00:05:55,01
and so on. Solar hot water.

64
00:05:57,56 --> 00:05:58,89
They used wind power.

65
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,54
Many of the properties were
located in the in the foothills

66
00:06:08,11 --> 00:06:12,47
around the mountain ranges
around the forested areas.

67
00:06:13,76 --> 00:06:17,88
And they became in a sense the
protectors of the forest.

68
00:06:19,03 --> 00:06:21,09
Such as at the rainier.

69
00:06:21,11 --> 00:06:28,05
Anyway these properties were ideally
suited for water park because

70
00:06:28,06 --> 00:06:32,83
there'd be streams running
out of these rainforests.

71
00:06:33,54 --> 00:06:39,33
Which never dried up. And so if
you put a pelton wheel into them.

72
00:06:39,35 --> 00:06:41,53
You could harness hydro power.

73
00:06:43,02 --> 00:06:44,43
And so they then use

74
00:06:44,43 --> 00:06:59,49
that as their energy source.

75
00:06:59,51 --> 00:07:01,51
This such a variety.

76
00:07:02,72 --> 00:07:07,61
You know there are domes ferro some and.

77
00:07:07,63 --> 00:07:10,41
Nestling in forests

78
00:07:10,42 --> 00:07:14,77
that sort of look somewhat like
mushrooms there are organic.

79
00:07:15,45 --> 00:07:22,19
And the years of thane
them with. You know.

80
00:07:22,21 --> 00:07:28,32
Moss and stuff and they
blend in beautifully.

81
00:07:28,33 --> 00:07:31,74
I mean i'm particularly keen
about recycling cereals.

82
00:07:34,90 --> 00:07:39,59
Often with in the case of timber the
recycled materials better than anything you

83
00:07:39,59 --> 00:07:42,98
can buy now. All the best
trees were cut years ago

84
00:07:44,04 --> 00:07:46,72
and.

85
00:07:46,74 --> 00:07:52,12
There's the timbers really
good quality season.

86
00:07:53,44 --> 00:07:54,34
And very strong.

87
00:07:54,97 --> 00:07:59,89
Our local hardwoods terrifically strong
then then there's all the cabinet making.

88
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,46
Timbers.

89
00:08:03,28 --> 00:08:09,14
Which you can selvage of fallen logs red
cedar for instance you can still find red

90
00:08:09,14 --> 00:08:16,02
cedar lying around.
That was cut years ago.

91
00:08:16,04 --> 00:08:21,96
A favourite house very difficult
to actually pick something out.

92
00:08:24,28 --> 00:08:26,18
I haven't thought of it in those terms.

93
00:08:26,48 --> 00:08:29,91
So that's why doesn't the doesn't come
thing i'm sure there is one but i.

94
00:08:30,17 --> 00:08:36,65
I just can't think of it. As a feat.

95
00:08:37,94 --> 00:08:44,79
Well i mean there are been amazing house
building feats in terms of just getting

96
00:08:44,79 --> 00:08:46,58
things built.

97
00:08:46,60 --> 00:08:52,11
There's a little stone cottage at thunderball
which is built on top of a cliff

98
00:08:52,11 --> 00:08:53,89
and every stone

99
00:08:53,89 --> 00:09:01,03
and every piece of material
was brought up by flying fox.

100
00:09:01,05 --> 00:09:05,69
That that was a real feed and it was
built by a woman a frail not free.

101
00:09:05,73 --> 00:09:06,83
I shouldn't call her frail

102
00:09:06,83 --> 00:09:14,18
but a slightly built
young woman build a pole

103
00:09:14,18 --> 00:09:15,64
frame construction on.

104
00:09:16,20 --> 00:09:21,54
The relatively steep hill sides
with poles that are seven

105
00:09:21,55 --> 00:09:26,62
or eight metres long. You know.

106
00:09:26,68 --> 00:09:30,28
So it's sort of three storey
split level construction.

107
00:09:31,93 --> 00:09:35,97
Amazing energy. To put these things up.

108
00:09:37,30 --> 00:09:41,32
And to have had the guts to stick with it

109
00:09:41,32 --> 00:09:47,81
and actually get it built because most of
these people have no previous building

110
00:09:47,82 --> 00:09:53,78
experience. They become. They become very.

111
00:09:53,80 --> 00:09:57,97
Multi-skilled on the land. You
know there's so much to do.

112
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:03,39
There are so many manual. Ask you you
learn very quickly to handle to.

113
00:10:03,41 --> 00:10:08,71
And and improvise and.

114
00:10:08,73 --> 00:10:10,56
So there's been a lot of that.

115
00:10:10,67 --> 00:10:22,75
Yes many great feats of building.

116
00:10:24,65 --> 00:10:27,56
Oh yes many of these building. Well.

117
00:10:27,67 --> 00:10:30,77
Well i mean there are buildings
that aren't finished

118
00:10:30,77 --> 00:10:35,15
that were started 18 years
ago. And are growing.

119
00:10:35,34 --> 00:10:40,88
I mean this is another aspect of of this
style of building it's it's organic it

120
00:10:40,89 --> 00:10:44,71
grows and it's fluctuates
according to needs.

121
00:10:44,90 --> 00:10:51,36
You know the it might start
off with a single person.

122
00:10:51,38 --> 00:10:56,83
Who then becomes a couple and you
know so they have to add extra space

123
00:10:56,83 --> 00:11:02,08
and then children come
along and more space and.

124
00:11:03,39 --> 00:11:06,70
And they discover more and
more about their environment

125
00:11:06,70 --> 00:11:08,27
and their immediate surroundings.

126
00:11:08,41 --> 00:11:10,89
So things get modified

127
00:11:10,89 --> 00:11:17,61
and improved to take advantage of the
north easterly breeze the winter sun

128
00:11:19,62 --> 00:11:20,31
sort of things.

129
00:11:20,92 --> 00:11:28,32
So many buildings are gone for many years.

130
00:11:28,33 --> 00:11:32,68
I think very few are
ever built. Full stop.

131
00:11:34,06 --> 00:11:36,63
You can only do that with a
brick veneer you can't do

132
00:11:36,63 --> 00:11:47,90
that with the sort of buildings
we're talking about.

133
00:11:47,92 --> 00:11:49,32
This.

134
00:11:50,93 --> 00:11:56,06
Well you know i realize

135
00:11:56,06 --> 00:11:59,90
that it's sort of.

136
00:12:00,74 --> 00:12:04,27
I realise that it's 20
years now since aquarius.

137
00:12:05,35 --> 00:12:08,21
But that in itself is just a date.

138
00:12:08,28 --> 00:12:12,41
I mean things have been moving
and changing all the time

139
00:12:13,13 --> 00:12:17,51
and will continue to do so. So.

140
00:12:18,76 --> 00:12:23,69
The vision that we had in
those early years in the 70s.

141
00:12:23,74 --> 00:12:30,63
I think in many ways has been
fulfilled though not precisely as we

142
00:12:30,63 --> 00:12:36,72
thought you know things are always changing
the state of flux of growth of learning.

143
00:12:38,30 --> 00:12:39,86
And.

144
00:12:39,88 --> 00:12:45,62
I see the next 20 years as a
continuation of that same process

145
00:12:46,77 --> 00:12:51,85
but i see the celebrating.
I actually don't think.

146
00:12:51,86 --> 00:12:55,23
Contrary to you might hear all
sorts of things about an ember

147
00:12:55,23 --> 00:12:59,46
and one of the things is that nothing's
happening here. Well you know.

148
00:12:59,91 --> 00:13:02,20
I i i have my finger on.

149
00:13:03,66 --> 00:13:06,31
A lot of things happening in

150
00:13:07,19 --> 00:13:12,56
that sort of poll seven in there are no
there are a lot of things going on in all

151
00:13:13,35 --> 00:13:15,53
all sorts of directions.

152
00:13:17,28 --> 00:13:22,78
You know alternate energy rainbow power
companies going from strength to strength.

153
00:13:24,32 --> 00:13:27,50
And you know the future is
you know alternative energy.

154
00:13:28,15 --> 00:13:35,36
I know the mainstream is still
hooked to non-renewable resources.

155
00:13:36,36 --> 00:13:42,25
But it's having to confront
you know the difficulties

156
00:13:42,25 --> 00:13:45,64
that are facing us that
are coming ahead and.

157
00:13:46,96 --> 00:13:50,82
So people like the rainbow power
company are becoming more

158
00:13:50,82 --> 00:13:56,93
and more relevant to the
mainstream. And so.

159
00:13:59,19 --> 00:14:04,92
There are all the. These aspects of our
lifestyle here that are still developing.

160
00:14:05,51 --> 00:14:09,49
There has been no full stop.
Nothing has really been achieved.

161
00:14:10,25 --> 00:14:15,62
And therefore you can put aside everything
is still continuing and growing

162
00:14:15,62 --> 00:14:21,38
and evolving.

163
00:14:24,94 --> 00:14:26,43
Well.

164
00:14:26,45 --> 00:14:32,51
I don't know if that's appropriate to
say because most of us in the beginning

165
00:14:32,51 --> 00:14:39,39
that beginning wave weren't
teenagers. We were in fact.

166
00:14:40,53 --> 00:14:50,08
You know early 20s on to late 30s.

167
00:14:50,09 --> 00:14:56,13
And so a lot of us have
have reached middle age in.

168
00:14:56,15 --> 00:15:01,95
You know now getting longer to and.

169
00:15:02,75 --> 00:15:06,39
But i hope not. We are of life.

170
00:15:07,12 --> 00:15:12,33
And a lot of kids have now grown up here.

171
00:15:14,21 --> 00:15:19,79
And while many of them. Leave nimbin.

172
00:15:20,85 --> 00:15:26,99
They take away the spirit
of nimbin and the values.

173
00:15:27,01 --> 00:15:33,15
And the sort of aquarian values.
And many of them come back.

174
00:15:35,01 --> 00:15:38,20
Many of us middle aged ones also leave

175
00:15:38,93 --> 00:15:42,19
and go to other places.

176
00:15:43,01 --> 00:15:49,54
And we hear of friends all over the place
doing similar things to what they were

177
00:15:49,54 --> 00:15:53,07
doing here. But. Often.

178
00:15:53,09 --> 00:15:59,88
Often now in the mainstream
people in government departments.

179
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,17
Yes.

180
00:16:02,18 --> 00:16:09,09
In various community organisations
basically all still moving in the

181
00:16:09,09 --> 00:16:15,84
same direction still looking for
alternatives to the dominant

182
00:16:15,84 --> 00:16:19,18
paradigm.

183
00:16:20,31 --> 00:16:23,92
Which is you know which is failing us and

184
00:16:23,92 --> 00:16:28,61
and so they're looking for
alternatives that they have a dance of

185
00:16:28,61 --> 00:16:34,96
that failure is everywhere
about us. And i think.

186
00:16:35,94 --> 00:16:42,11
So i see nimbin as continuing
to pursue these concerns

187
00:16:42,11 --> 00:16:43,63
environmental

188
00:16:43,63 --> 00:16:50,38
and energy schooling birthing recycling.

189
00:16:50,40 --> 00:16:56,78
You know we've set up a recycling
centre in the village.

190
00:16:57,49 --> 00:17:04,96
We're very concerned with
waste management in general.

191
00:17:04,98 --> 00:17:11,69
We're going to keep on
evolving community structures.

192
00:17:12,99 --> 00:17:18,22
You know we've got a thriving artist
artistic community here we've got the school

193
00:17:18,22 --> 00:17:22,10
of arts with the hall.

194
00:17:23,90 --> 00:17:30,21
Many many musicians many
painters craftspeople

195
00:17:31,30 --> 00:17:35,59
all of those things are
continuing to be developed.

196
00:17:38,26 --> 00:17:44,11
And i think as as the the world economic

197
00:17:44,11 --> 00:17:48,80
and environmental crises.
Becomes more apparent.

198
00:17:50,93 --> 00:17:54,56
So the mainstream will look more

199
00:17:54,56 --> 00:17:58,08
and more to places like nimbin.

200
00:17:59,07 --> 00:18:07,44
For the solutions.
