1
00:00:16,06 --> 00:00:20,70
So. When. And.

2
00:00:20,72 --> 00:00:26,00
Where is the problem.

3
00:00:26,02 --> 00:00:27,93
His problem all

4
00:00:28,80 --> 00:00:34,39
and.

5
00:00:35,37 --> 00:00:36,57
Well i'm robyn moore

6
00:00:36,57 --> 00:00:43,20
and i'm a member of rob red community which
is one of the older ones established in

7
00:00:43,20 --> 00:00:45,39
this area we.

8
00:00:46,25 --> 00:00:53,11
Were was established in
nineteen eighty as a

9
00:00:53,11 --> 00:00:57,96
community before that i had
lived on the property.

10
00:00:57,98 --> 00:01:02,81
For a couple of years and
it soon became clear that.

11
00:01:02,83 --> 00:01:08,56
There was an absurdly large amount
of land for a single widow with

12
00:01:10,19 --> 00:01:12,94
at the time. No no family living with me.

13
00:01:15,44 --> 00:01:21,40
And so since i kept meeting young
people in the area who had.

14
00:01:22,07 --> 00:01:23,40
Obviously had skills

15
00:01:24,15 --> 00:01:30,37
and great need for a home base.

16
00:01:30,39 --> 00:01:36,18
I kept thinking well this is would be a
good idea to do to see if we could become a

17
00:01:36,18 --> 00:01:41,60
community and the whole story
of how this has happened is.

18
00:01:41,61 --> 00:01:48,04
As i unfolded over the
last 12 years a couple

19
00:01:48,04 --> 00:01:52,55
first i met.

20
00:01:52,57 --> 00:01:57,09
I had been admiring these
mugs that and jugs

21
00:01:57,09 --> 00:02:01,39
that were in the local craft shop.
And had bought several of them.

22
00:02:02,06 --> 00:02:08,75
Because i just like the the way they
were thrown and the design of them.

23
00:02:08,77 --> 00:02:15,62
And i was at a function in nimbin
where money was being raised

24
00:02:15,62 --> 00:02:17,97
to the person beyond i think

25
00:02:18,92 --> 00:02:22,82
and someone introduced jeff sterling to me

26
00:02:23,82 --> 00:02:25,81
and i realised this is
the name of the potter.

27
00:02:25,86 --> 00:02:31,98
So i got talking with him and
found out that he and his wife

28
00:02:31,98 --> 00:02:37,46
and family were. Just
about to leave the area.

29
00:02:37,86 --> 00:02:40,10
Having been here for a couple of years

30
00:02:40,10 --> 00:02:46,54
and not found any satisfactory place
to live and. It had been for them.

31
00:02:46,68 --> 00:02:52,57
It hadn't been a great success.
So i said hey you know.

32
00:02:53,88 --> 00:02:57,64
We've got some land out
here at lillian rob.

33
00:02:57,66 --> 00:02:59,56
Why don't you come out and have a look.

34
00:03:00,90 --> 00:03:04,93
You know we've been looking for people
especially people like you with.

35
00:03:04,95 --> 00:03:11,69
With skills and who want
to live in the area.

36
00:03:12,48 --> 00:03:16,93
So they thank me very politely
and said well maybe yes.

37
00:03:17,07 --> 00:03:22,37
If we've got time before we leave.
We'll try and get out to you. And.

38
00:03:22,76 --> 00:03:28,48
The next day was sunday i think and we
were having a work day then you know wall

39
00:03:28,48 --> 00:03:31,57
and i think i was up on the
roof painting the roof

40
00:03:31,57 --> 00:03:35,22
and suddenly they should turn up

41
00:03:35,22 --> 00:03:41,06
but definitely he's doing saying hey we
couldn't we couldn't sleep all night

42
00:03:41,06 --> 00:03:47,45
thinking about this. Could we could we come
and see the place and so that was good.

43
00:03:47,59 --> 00:03:50,35
So we brought them out and.

44
00:03:50,36 --> 00:03:54,32
They came and they looked
around and we had lunch and

45
00:03:55,65 --> 00:03:58,95
and i said yes we'd like to
like to take you up on this.

46
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,83
So that was really the beginning. I
mean it really was a pick up wasn't it.

47
00:04:04,93 --> 00:04:08,13
That's it. And.

48
00:04:08,83 --> 00:04:12,08
Well they came a couple of.

49
00:04:12,47 --> 00:04:17,03
They moved over a couple
of months later and.

50
00:04:17,05 --> 00:04:22,83
They've been here ever since
and they've gone through many.

51
00:04:23,95 --> 00:04:27,69
Transfiguration xx. Jeff being a potter.

52
00:04:27,71 --> 00:04:33,05
Polly being a leather craftsman and then.

53
00:04:34,14 --> 00:04:35,24
Weaver.

54
00:04:35,25 --> 00:04:36,61
Dress designer

55
00:04:37,54 --> 00:04:44,37
and now they are the wild turkey felt
makers who were. Exporting their.

56
00:04:44,39 --> 00:04:49,62
Produce products produce sort
of up and down the coast.

57
00:04:49,64 --> 00:04:53,46
You know and running workshops
in still making and

58
00:04:55,97 --> 00:05:00,52
and from from then on there was
a gradual jeff's brother came

59
00:05:00,52 --> 00:05:06,50
and he settled here and.
He's a cabinet maker.

60
00:05:06,52 --> 00:05:08,32
And wanted to others and.

61
00:05:09,74 --> 00:05:14,36
So it grew very slowly and gradually.

62
00:05:14,38 --> 00:05:20,19
And people lived in tents while they
built themselves cabins or shelters.

63
00:05:22,34 --> 00:05:25,62
Do you want me to talk about the.

64
00:05:27,05 --> 00:05:32,37
The process of becoming legal.

65
00:05:33,11 --> 00:05:39,54
Process. Quite.

66
00:05:39,56 --> 00:05:40,75
They as well.

67
00:05:42,30 --> 00:05:49,14
The thing that i felt seemed
to be important was that.

68
00:05:50,04 --> 00:05:52,22
If people.

69
00:05:52,24 --> 00:05:58,39
Needed a place to build a home and needed.

70
00:05:58,97 --> 00:06:03,91
The sort of support. So that
the community can give you.

71
00:06:04,88 --> 00:06:09,12
Those were the very important criteria.

72
00:06:10,36 --> 00:06:15,24
It wasn't so important
that they have money.

73
00:06:15,25 --> 00:06:20,92
That they contribute money to buy shares.

74
00:06:23,86 --> 00:06:30,26
I didn't want money to be the limiting factor
because after all the places paid for.

75
00:06:30,41 --> 00:06:36,67
Anyway. You know i wasn't under
any particular burden of debt.

76
00:06:36,68 --> 00:06:43,31
So that it was a matter of
was more important to. For.

77
00:06:43,33 --> 00:06:48,43
Sort of sympathetic people to get
together. To share the land.

78
00:06:49,76 --> 00:06:53,30
And i think on the whole
it's worked out that way.

79
00:06:54,59 --> 00:06:59,83
And we've only ever had
people come by invitation.

80
00:06:59,84 --> 00:07:02,29
They've been a few who've.

81
00:07:03,88 --> 00:07:04,99
Sort of racked up

82
00:07:04,99 --> 00:07:11,83
and said hey you know i've got i've just
got so much money i want to share here

83
00:07:11,83 --> 00:07:18,59
and we have to say i'm sorry that's not the
way we do things here in fact sometimes

84
00:07:18,59 --> 00:07:23,24
it's it takes it takes
100 per cent approval.

85
00:07:24,19 --> 00:07:28,89
Before any new one can
come on to live here.

86
00:07:30,32 --> 00:07:30,81
As a member

87
00:07:30,81 --> 00:07:42,46
that is.

88
00:07:42,47 --> 00:07:48,04
So i think that was. Yes.

89
00:07:48,93 --> 00:07:53,71
When another idea that i
had at the beginning and.

90
00:07:53,72 --> 00:07:59,80
One reason i was particularly glad
to have polly and this stirling cow.

91
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,30
It was that they were artists
and creative people.

92
00:08:05,32 --> 00:08:11,46
And i had known from my own
parents experience that.

93
00:08:11,48 --> 00:08:18,05
Its very hard often for people who are
creative in this way to acquire much

94
00:08:19,17 --> 00:08:20,36
capital basis.

95
00:08:20,74 --> 00:08:26,13
So i felt that it would be good
if there were more emphasis

96
00:08:27,58 --> 00:08:32,75
or more people who had
these sort of skills

97
00:08:33,58 --> 00:08:39,76
and needed a place to live. I felt
that would be a very important.

98
00:08:40,85 --> 00:08:47,49
Aspect to inviting those
individuals to come and live here.

99
00:08:48,57 --> 00:08:53,35
Mind you it isn't always then
not everybody is that way.

100
00:08:54,38 --> 00:08:56,71
But there are there's
a number of musicians

101
00:08:57,97 --> 00:09:01,84
and a number of craftspeople.

102
00:09:01,86 --> 00:09:06,43
I think probably in every
household there's one or other.

103
00:09:07,22 --> 00:09:07,52
But that

104
00:09:07,52 --> 00:09:16,57
that is only been a fortunate sort of
huge one thing leading to another huge.

105
00:09:18,50 --> 00:09:21,85
Situation. Oh.

106
00:09:21,86 --> 00:09:26,15
Well it's i think the stemmed from.

107
00:09:26,17 --> 00:09:32,90
Knowing that my parents had
their great difficulty and.

108
00:09:32,92 --> 00:09:39,71
In paying rent even and they had to pay
the rent. So most of their married life.

109
00:09:40,47 --> 00:09:46,71
They didn't have enough to put together
you know what was necessary to own their

110
00:09:46,71 --> 00:09:50,93
own home. Oh my father.

111
00:09:52,23 --> 00:09:58,49
Or at all my father is an artist and
my mother was writer and between them

112
00:09:58,49 --> 00:10:05,09
and i knew that they. Had quite a hard
financial struggle and in fact we never.

113
00:10:05,11 --> 00:10:06,78
They never earned their own home

114
00:10:06,78 --> 00:10:12,92
and till i was sort of
in my thirties probably.

115
00:10:12,94 --> 00:10:17,39
So that they were constantly having
to pay rent for a place to live.

116
00:10:18,85 --> 00:10:21,49
And i just felt that.

117
00:10:21,50 --> 00:10:24,49
So people who had these creative skills

118
00:10:26,15 --> 00:10:31,41
and wanted to devote their energies to.

119
00:10:31,43 --> 00:10:33,58
Exploring those skills.

120
00:10:34,43 --> 00:10:41,13
It would be rather good to
allow them to live here

121
00:10:41,13 --> 00:10:47,05
without too much financial
burden for i mean there's no

122
00:10:47,81 --> 00:10:50,73
effective rent or the cost.

123
00:10:50,87 --> 00:11:00,27
Never was to be the important thing is.

124
00:11:01,15 --> 00:11:08,01
Pay back time. And by pay
back do you mean sort of.

125
00:11:08,03 --> 00:11:14,75
I guess trying to make
good. I mean yes. Well.

126
00:11:14,76 --> 00:11:15,88
I think my parents.

127
00:11:16,34 --> 00:11:21,83
I mean they just managed somehow
or other but i just felt

128
00:11:21,83 --> 00:11:27,99
that i didn't want. People.

129
00:11:28,01 --> 00:11:30,37
I just thought it would
be that a better way.

130
00:11:30,62 --> 00:11:36,62
If they didn't have to spend most
of their income paying for rent

131
00:11:37,87 --> 00:11:41,22
and they could use it. In
building a house or garden

132
00:11:41,22 --> 00:11:43,64
or you know helping with their children.

133
00:11:44,01 --> 00:11:48,98
She's not answering it very well is

134
00:11:52,30 --> 00:11:57,76
she.

135
00:11:57,78 --> 00:12:02,85
Up same. Yes.

136
00:12:04,01 --> 00:12:10,06
Oh yes in in. All in this whole area.

137
00:12:10,08 --> 00:12:16,62
Since 1970s 1973 which was
the aquarius the first

138
00:12:16,62 --> 00:12:25,17
aquarius festival time they had
been a number of people becoming.

139
00:12:25,18 --> 00:12:27,38
Interested in building their own homes.

140
00:12:27,84 --> 00:12:34,39
Of course and the home builders
association had become pretty active.

141
00:12:35,50 --> 00:12:38,31
And one of the.

142
00:12:38,33 --> 00:12:40,26
Problems about this was

143
00:12:40,26 --> 00:12:45,44
that there was not much.

144
00:12:45,46 --> 00:12:49,49
Consultation there was no
nothing in the way of.

145
00:12:49,51 --> 00:12:51,99
A manual on how to build your own home

146
00:12:51,99 --> 00:12:57,98
or there was very little literature
around available to help people like

147
00:12:57,98 --> 00:12:59,50
that and there were.

148
00:13:00,11 --> 00:13:04,53
There was one architect and a number
of people who had some skills

149
00:13:05,25 --> 00:13:09,07
and they were very active
that was eddie. Of course.

150
00:13:09,09 --> 00:13:15,32
They were very active in this
home builders association.

151
00:13:15,33 --> 00:13:18,25
And the home builders association.

152
00:13:18,27 --> 00:13:22,85
In conjunction with i
guess lismore council.

153
00:13:23,46 --> 00:13:29,98
Got together this seminar in lismore
in no i think it was about november

154
00:13:29,98 --> 00:13:36,96
1979. I know it was just
before the eighties.

155
00:13:38,69 --> 00:13:40,03
And it at that seminar.

156
00:13:40,56 --> 00:13:47,48
Paul lander who was then the minister
for the environment i think she came

157
00:13:47,49 --> 00:13:51,43
and after a lot of discussion
and a lot of argument

158
00:13:51,43 --> 00:13:55,51
and a lot of opposition
from his not councils and

159
00:13:55,52 --> 00:13:59,82
and other people to
landowners were feeling very.

160
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,22
Threatened by this idea of
multiple occupancies. Paul lander.

161
00:14:07,33 --> 00:14:11,27
Came out with this summation.

162
00:14:11,29 --> 00:14:16,09
Alright we will establish a
pilot scheme of twenty two.

163
00:14:16,11 --> 00:14:22,50
I think it was multiple occupancies which
will be permitted in the list moesha.

164
00:14:23,56 --> 00:14:27,06
Will the stablish a consulting team.

165
00:14:27,08 --> 00:14:33,19
I could take builders who bring out a i
think they brought out a low cost country

166
00:14:33,19 --> 00:14:36,53
housing booklet.

167
00:14:36,55 --> 00:14:43,67
And there was generally a
sort of an overriding of the.

168
00:14:43,68 --> 00:14:44,87
The fears

169
00:14:44,87 --> 00:14:52,27
and the opposition being put up
against multiple occupancies.

170
00:14:52,29 --> 00:14:58,89
And of course for those of us who
had been interested in cane about

171
00:14:58,89 --> 00:15:04,21
stablish ing. This form of land use.

172
00:15:04,22 --> 00:15:06,28
It was a time of.

173
00:15:07,48 --> 00:15:13,90
Euphoria or at least that moment of
euphoria. And as a result of that.

174
00:15:14,25 --> 00:15:19,71
Although we ourselves are not
enlist moesha but in cairo galicia.

175
00:15:20,42 --> 00:15:24,46
I felt that it was only a
matter of time before.

176
00:15:24,47 --> 00:15:28,03
The other shah's would be.

177
00:15:30,51 --> 00:15:32,53
Willing to accept the idea
of multiple occupancy.

178
00:15:34,03 --> 00:15:40,59
And so i felt all right about trying
to go ahead with inviting people

179
00:15:40,59 --> 00:15:43,12
to come and share the land here.

180
00:15:45,75 --> 00:15:48,59
This wasn't i wasn't
unique in this. There was.

181
00:15:49,94 --> 00:15:53,68
There were two or three other
people in the area who were also.

182
00:15:53,70 --> 00:15:59,90
Who owned land who were also doing
this i think i've been lucky that.

183
00:16:00,96 --> 00:16:05,72
The people who have sort of
swam into this area have

184
00:16:08,15 --> 00:16:13,47
somehow or other sort of settled
and. We've been able to be as.

185
00:16:13,49 --> 00:16:18,70
To consolidate the community
as well as we have.

186
00:16:19,55 --> 00:16:26,39
There was a period of course from
from 1980 when the first new.

187
00:16:28,11 --> 00:16:34,83
The first people who my invited here
came to live here in the early 1980s.

188
00:16:36,22 --> 00:16:41,47
There until about nine hundred
eighty six. I think it was 1987.

189
00:16:42,56 --> 00:16:49,39
That we got official recognition of our
right to have a multiple occupancy

190
00:16:50,83 --> 00:16:56,77
on this land. But that was
during the time when council.

191
00:16:56,79 --> 00:17:03,39
Was going through quite a lot of.
Hard searching you could call it.

192
00:17:03,52 --> 00:17:09,71
I suppose about the wisdom of having multiple
occupancies mind you they were having

193
00:17:09,71 --> 00:17:15,91
them anyway they because there was a lot
of people just just settling and living

194
00:17:15,91 --> 00:17:17,51
and building.

195
00:17:17,53 --> 00:17:21,59
And i felt quite sorry for
the council inspectors

196
00:17:21,59 --> 00:17:27,41
and they started sort of telling us their
sad story how you know they they had no

197
00:17:28,58 --> 00:17:35,56
physical way of of even visiting all
these laces let alone inspecting them

198
00:17:35,56 --> 00:17:41,17
properly and assessing
their long term worse.

199
00:17:42,79 --> 00:17:49,33
That ever counts so i think
eventually accepted the proposition

200
00:17:49,33 --> 00:17:55,33
that they would have to
allow multiple occupancies.

201
00:17:55,35 --> 00:18:00,44
They have done it in this in
this corner of their. Sure.

202
00:18:01,92 --> 00:18:04,38
Which used to be part of
the old touraine isha.

203
00:18:04,88 --> 00:18:09,56
And they excluded multiple occupancies
from the rest of the shire.

204
00:18:10,04 --> 00:18:15,66
At least at the beginning. In fact
that i think has probably changed now.

205
00:18:16,77 --> 00:18:21,97
As they've found that we haven't got
you know horns and green tails and

206
00:18:23,16 --> 00:18:28,55
that we are really human beings
too and maybe it's just as.

207
00:18:29,28 --> 00:18:38,85
Adequate a land uses as any
other form of occupancy.

208
00:18:40,92 --> 00:18:46,67
Or. What.

209
00:18:46,69 --> 00:18:53,64
So that's just i think very personal in

210
00:18:53,64 --> 00:18:57,63
my daughter.

211
00:19:00,73 --> 00:19:07,53
When i came to nimbin because
my i guess i must i can't claim

212
00:19:07,53 --> 00:19:08,77
any particular.

213
00:19:09,24 --> 00:19:13,43
Merit out of this my daughter had
been interested in the place

214
00:19:14,60 --> 00:19:20,39
and had been living here
for a couple of years.

215
00:19:21,59 --> 00:19:26,24
My son had been here for the

216
00:19:28,33 --> 00:19:29,46
aquarius festival.

217
00:19:30,44 --> 00:19:36,35
He had old enough i thought to
hitchhike up here from school

218
00:19:37,48 --> 00:19:38,50
with a couple of his friends

219
00:19:38,50 --> 00:19:44,60
but there was no way i was going to
allow my cysteine year old daughter to

220
00:19:45,73 --> 00:19:50,75
come up here on her own hitchhiking so.

221
00:19:51,70 --> 00:19:58,21
I bundled her and a number of her
friends and tent into the car

222
00:19:58,21 --> 00:19:59,89
and we drove up here.

223
00:20:00,61 --> 00:20:06,13
And so i sort of inadvertently i was

224
00:20:06,14 --> 00:20:11,28
that the name is to 1973
although i must confess

225
00:20:11,28 --> 00:20:14,44
that it was not of my initial change.

226
00:20:14,91 --> 00:20:20,04
Although now i'm very glad that i was
experienced at least a little bit of it.

227
00:20:22,14 --> 00:20:26,77
I didn't come back again until
a couple of years later

228
00:20:26,77 --> 00:20:34,42
when i visited my daughter who altered.

229
00:20:35,76 --> 00:20:40,39
I came back to visit my daughter a
couple of times in the succeeding years.

230
00:20:42,32 --> 00:20:48,21
And it was. Of a stimulating
in a very exciting place.

231
00:20:49,12 --> 00:20:54,77
Naturally i was appalled by some of the
sort of conditions the young people were

232
00:20:54,77 --> 00:21:01,42
living in like like my daughter
had her first home consisted of a

233
00:21:01,42 --> 00:21:02,65
piece of plastic.

234
00:21:04,26 --> 00:21:10,82
Pinned up tied up underneath the
lantana bush that she had carved out.

235
00:21:10,83 --> 00:21:14,62
And she was perfectly happy

236
00:21:14,62 --> 00:21:20,12
that i'm glad the stage moved
on slightly grander things and

237
00:21:20,12 --> 00:21:25,54
that but at the time at the
stage she was at that was.

238
00:21:25,56 --> 00:21:29,60
And she was making their good friends
she was happy she was healthy.

239
00:21:31,26 --> 00:21:31,48
And

240
00:21:32,90 --> 00:21:39,29
and i really began to appreciate
something of what this whole area

241
00:21:39,29 --> 00:21:43,85
and philosophy was.

242
00:21:43,87 --> 00:21:47,28
Doing or was about.

243
00:21:49,11 --> 00:21:55,79
And i must state that it was the
young people who sort of told me.

244
00:21:57,73 --> 00:21:59,75
But for them. I would have gone on as a.

245
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,31
Sort of the standard middle class
mum in the suburbs of sydney

246
00:22:07,64 --> 00:22:17,99
much of what was.

247
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:22,89
Said.

248
00:22:22,91 --> 00:22:27,45
I think the philosophy of.

249
00:22:27,47 --> 00:22:36,28
Trying to be as.

250
00:22:36,30 --> 00:22:38,89
A ride and i think initially

251
00:22:38,89 --> 00:22:44,45
when we first i first came
to live here at rob road.

252
00:22:44,47 --> 00:22:48,80
There was a general feeling
at the end of the 70s

253
00:22:48,80 --> 00:22:55,65
that we should be trying to
live a lot more simply than

254
00:22:55,65 --> 00:22:59,03
we had been living and also

255
00:22:59,03 --> 00:23:05,63
that we should be exploring different
uses of the land. Different uses.

256
00:23:07,90 --> 00:23:08,77
Of agriculture.

257
00:23:09,14 --> 00:23:14,55
Different types of agriculture much
more towards the line of permaculture

258
00:23:15,71 --> 00:23:18,61
and sustainable sort of.

259
00:23:20,87 --> 00:23:25,71
Production rather than the
agricultural monoculture

260
00:23:25,71 --> 00:23:30,78
that is the more general.

261
00:23:33,69 --> 00:23:39,56
Let's see other philosophies tard
when you look this isn't his.

262
00:23:39,58 --> 00:23:44,61
Philosophy sort of grow out
of experienced aren't they

263
00:23:47,96 --> 00:23:54,15
there was a bit of fear. I think i
know amongst some people. That.

264
00:23:57,03 --> 00:24:03,69
There would be a world cup. Lapse. Of.

265
00:24:03,71 --> 00:24:05,24
Supply.

266
00:24:05,26 --> 00:24:09,41
Things like petrol and oil and the fear

267
00:24:09,41 --> 00:24:15,50
that still the fear of nuclear holocaust.

268
00:24:15,52 --> 00:24:17,84
So that to live in a place

269
00:24:17,84 --> 00:24:24,80
that was at least slightly remote.

270
00:24:26,34 --> 00:24:32,57
Slightly more removed from the
centers of socal civilization

271
00:24:33,72 --> 00:24:37,26
seemed to be of positive benefit.

272
00:24:38,21 --> 00:24:40,85
Mind you i don't think
we succeeded very much.

273
00:24:40,85 --> 00:24:43,23
Well i mean it seems to have got closer

274
00:24:43,23 --> 00:24:46,46
and closer to her everything
in the intervening time

275
00:24:46,46 --> 00:24:52,00
and i remember feeling how how
remote it all was at first

276
00:24:52,72 --> 00:24:56,51
and now it just seems as if it's just.

277
00:24:56,53 --> 00:25:04,07
You know just like a suburb
of the whole east coast.

278
00:25:04,09 --> 00:25:06,44
I think that the.

279
00:25:07,58 --> 00:25:11,65
It was it was very much
a social experiment.

280
00:25:13,19 --> 00:25:14,43
If one can use

281
00:25:14,43 --> 00:25:20,45
that word experiment without having
any control system to judge it by

282
00:25:22,57 --> 00:25:28,71
but a social experiment in
seeing how well one could

283
00:25:30,56 --> 00:25:35,92
live. In respect to quality of life.

284
00:25:37,28 --> 00:25:43,28
On very very little money
very little income

285
00:25:45,89 --> 00:25:50,69
and maybe as smug but a sort of feel

286
00:25:52,58 --> 00:25:58,90
when i look when i visit my
friends in the city. With their.

287
00:25:58,92 --> 00:26:02,78
Most of the. Now i've got rid of
their mortgages but only just.

288
00:26:04,51 --> 00:26:08,14
And they've got their
three cars and there.

289
00:26:08,16 --> 00:26:13,79
You know their problems about where they
go this year for their holidays and.

290
00:26:15,86 --> 00:26:20,09
Such concerns. I feel t.

291
00:26:20,39 --> 00:26:27,16
We really have got.
Such a lovely peaceful.

292
00:26:27,89 --> 00:26:29,98
And there is a quality of life here

293
00:26:31,75 --> 00:26:36,73
and we haven't had to go through
those years of she stresses

294
00:26:36,73 --> 00:26:39,88
and trauma that a lot of people has

295
00:26:41,97 --> 00:26:46,64
and i think there is something
coming out of this.

296
00:26:47,44 --> 00:26:52,44
Of course the main i've always said
the main product of this community.

297
00:26:52,46 --> 00:26:55,02
If you if you want to talk about product.

298
00:26:55,47 --> 00:26:59,60
As a as a measure of success.

299
00:26:59,62 --> 00:27:02,87
The product of this
community is its children

300
00:27:04,63 --> 00:27:08,13
and the the children who
are growing up here

301
00:27:08,13 --> 00:27:12,43
and have grown up over the last four years

302
00:27:15,70 --> 00:27:21,40
just seem to be such well-balanced lovely

303
00:27:22,81 --> 00:27:28,16
lively. Unstressed. Young people.

304
00:27:29,36 --> 00:27:35,68
I guess it's early times to say
yet how they'll end up later on.

305
00:27:35,70 --> 00:27:36,06
But

306
00:27:37,34 --> 00:27:43,66
but it's a it's a big group of
children like there are 18.

307
00:27:43,84 --> 00:27:46,87
I think.

308
00:27:46,89 --> 00:27:53,96
And with the eldest being 18 years
old the youngest being one.

309
00:27:55,03 --> 00:27:59,55
That they have. They have
more of a community.

310
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:06,30
Then they're adults their parents are
really in they they sort of care for each

311
00:28:06,30 --> 00:28:07,78
other they look after each other

312
00:28:07,78 --> 00:28:13,82
and there's a lot of course the
little groups of age range

313
00:28:13,82 --> 00:28:14,98
or sex

314
00:28:14,99 --> 00:28:21,76
that get together like there's a cluster
of little girls about fdr five little

315
00:28:21,76 --> 00:28:23,20
girls all about the same age

316
00:28:23,99 --> 00:28:27,73
and they form the most wonderful
little subgroup amongst them

317
00:28:28,61 --> 00:28:34,91
but on the whole i think you know
if you want to judge a society by

318
00:28:35,84 --> 00:28:42,80
anything. The behavior and. Health of
their children is is one way that.

319
00:28:43,37 --> 00:28:44,56
It could be judged.

320
00:28:47,75 --> 00:28:53,28
To.

321
00:28:53,30 --> 00:28:57,51
Times.

322
00:28:58,32 --> 00:29:00,75
How she smiling.

323
00:29:01,98 --> 00:29:07,79
Oh she she has. My own daughter.

324
00:29:08,08 --> 00:29:09,40
Yes she has.

325
00:29:11,93 --> 00:29:18,88
Well she's she moved in her desires
for home life from sort of the

326
00:29:18,88 --> 00:29:25,45
normal suburban middle class
suburban domestic set up

327
00:29:25,45 --> 00:29:28,97
with her own room and you know.

328
00:29:30,92 --> 00:29:32,29
Washing machines and everything

329
00:29:32,29 --> 00:29:39,00
that was appropriate in in the
suburban household to this shelter

330
00:29:39,00 --> 00:29:43,49
with a sleeping bag underneath a plastic.

331
00:29:44,46 --> 00:29:46,65
Skin plastic sheet.

332
00:29:48,76 --> 00:29:52,33
Tied into a land on a bush.

333
00:29:53,57 --> 00:29:59,41
And then through successive. Homes that
she and her partner has been built.

334
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,57
From you know simple bush
polls two splendid stone.

335
00:30:05,59 --> 00:30:10,96
And tile mansions almost. And then.

336
00:30:10,98 --> 00:30:15,35
She decided. Right.

337
00:30:15,37 --> 00:30:21,29
I want to do something in my life i don't
want to spend my time. Just washing and.

338
00:30:22,79 --> 00:30:28,58
Doing the garden. So she went back
as a mature students and did nursing

339
00:30:29,63 --> 00:30:34,80
and is now working in sydney
as a community nurse.

340
00:30:35,35 --> 00:30:40,30
And they happy.

341
00:30:41,20 --> 00:30:50,01
If she saw the right sort of work
opportunity i think she might is.

342
00:30:50,03 --> 00:30:57,79
Such.

343
00:30:57,81 --> 00:31:00,35
The legal structure right.

344
00:31:01,68 --> 00:31:08,99
Well from 1980 on we gradually.

345
00:31:10,76 --> 00:31:13,96
Came across. People.

346
00:31:13,97 --> 00:31:18,92
In the area who were searching
for a place to live.

347
00:31:21,36 --> 00:31:22,39
And.

348
00:31:23,54 --> 00:31:29,10
Those of us who were
then living on the farm.

349
00:31:30,19 --> 00:31:37,06
More or less decided whether or not
we would invite them to to come

350
00:31:37,06 --> 00:31:38,01
and share the land.
