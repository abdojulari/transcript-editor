1
00:00:03,93 --> 00:00:05,92
Mr. Norman. Scott. This is mr.

2
00:00:05,92 --> 00:00:10,45
Norman. Schofield who worked on the sydney
harbour bridge approaches so during the

3
00:00:10,45 --> 00:00:14,59
building of the brutes. Do you remember
how you got the job. Do you mr.

4
00:00:14,59 --> 00:00:19,92
Schofield yes well it was depression
time and jobs weren't easy

5
00:00:21,84 --> 00:00:28,19
and we used to all the players so used to
go down to the union rooms and put their

6
00:00:28,19 --> 00:00:30,78
names on the roster and there's

7
00:00:30,78 --> 00:00:37,73
a roster move. Barometer like they took
you on on your turn came for the day

8
00:00:37,73 --> 00:00:44,49
when your name came to the
top. With the the main

9
00:00:44,50 --> 00:00:47,37
roads department because the
public works there wasn't

10
00:00:47,37 --> 00:00:53,22
a jew member who took you on.
Well the man in charge was

11
00:00:53,22 --> 00:00:57,24
a man named shepherd i other than that i
wouldn't know what his christian name was

12
00:00:57,24 --> 00:01:03,64
a really you know i don't but the just
went down there and showed him this

13
00:01:03,64 --> 00:01:09,61
brief from the union and they put it on and
you remember how many there were going

14
00:01:09,61 --> 00:01:12,37
. Yeah well on our section there was about

15
00:01:12,37 --> 00:01:19,26
a ten to fourteen i think it would be around
between ten and fourteen and we worked

16
00:01:19,26 --> 00:01:22,73
three weeks and then.
We were stood down for

17
00:01:22,74 --> 00:01:26,65
a week while somebody else took our
place and that's how they made it

18
00:01:26,65 --> 00:01:31,29
a job like. Spread it out
for more plasterers to get

19
00:01:31,29 --> 00:01:38,23
a job out of it. And the wages in those
days was four pounds six or weak and

20
00:01:38,23 --> 00:01:39,38
we paid

21
00:01:39,38 --> 00:01:46,39
a shilling shelling in the pound.
Like just takes your unemployed

22
00:01:46,39 --> 00:01:48,56
text. It was a text that mr.

23
00:01:48,56 --> 00:01:54,92
Lang have put on his vesta keep everybody
employed and that was it just the

24
00:01:54,92 --> 00:01:56,57
system of one week off was

25
00:01:56,57 --> 00:02:02,03
a work rationing i believe and. And the
other other system i believe of the tax was

26
00:02:02,03 --> 00:02:05,88
paid by people who were employed for the
unemployed. That's right that's right. We

27
00:02:06,82 --> 00:02:12,33
all took our turn. Yes. And what it what
work did you do all down the length i mean

28
00:02:12,33 --> 00:02:15,70
there was a gang of ten or fourteen
of you and exactly how many of you do

29
00:02:15,70 --> 00:02:19,63
a responsible for all the plastering on
the northern approach as well on the

30
00:02:19,63 --> 00:02:24,26
northern part i say that the crowd that
where there was about ten of us i think

31
00:02:24,26 --> 00:02:30,25
between ten and fourteen. And i know that
there were four that were working well

32
00:02:30,25 --> 00:02:33,41
past north sydney station
they were either working on

33
00:02:33,41 --> 00:02:39,95
a bridge there and over at bridge. But
they your one gang did all the plastering

34
00:02:39,95 --> 00:02:44,90
all the way around. N it no true. Yes
yes yes and it's incredible. It's

35
00:02:44,90 --> 00:02:51,87
a lot of work. Yes well of course you had
to work in those days. You didn't last

36
00:02:51,87 --> 00:02:57,46
long. And was there another going to
do the southern approaches. Yes i was

37
00:02:57,46 --> 00:03:03,55
a complete different crowd down on the
other side where they work right back from

38
00:03:03,55 --> 00:03:09,78
the steel like their right back to the
tunnel leading into wynyard. And the

39
00:03:09,78 --> 00:03:15,64
railways took over from there was it. Yes
yes. You did did you do the railway.

40
00:03:16,13 --> 00:03:22,22
Culverts there up up at no city as well.
Yes yes they were done by us. And exactly

41
00:03:22,22 --> 00:03:27,78
what was the job because i don't think it's
done. I mean more. Your job now. Well.

42
00:03:28,77 --> 00:03:33,26
There's very little of the type of work
we did there. Ever done any more people

43
00:03:33,26 --> 00:03:39,04
wouldn't pay the price for
work. It was and. Had to be

44
00:03:40,44 --> 00:03:47,39
assured that there would be no imperfections
or. The labor or there used to

45
00:03:47,39 --> 00:03:52,59
wash the scene and get all the impurities
out of it. And incidentally the sand came

46
00:03:52,59 --> 00:03:59,51
from. A looks pretty river
not plane and head it was

47
00:03:59,51 --> 00:04:05,92
all sifted and washed and let out
to dry and then it was eventually

48
00:04:05,92 --> 00:04:12,21
used and it was complete. A
mixture of three and one of

49
00:04:14,90 --> 00:04:20,93
sand and lysand summoned three of cement
and one of sand or three of cement

50
00:04:21,83 --> 00:04:24,47
through sand one cement. Three

51
00:04:24,47 --> 00:04:31,36
a sand one of summit. Yeah.
And you came along when the

52
00:04:31,36 --> 00:04:34,76
concrete as it finished their work
and then you trolled on coats

53
00:04:34,76 --> 00:04:40,70
a roomba. That's right. It's right. They
let it stand for about three months and if

54
00:04:40,71 --> 00:04:46,70
there was any movement in the. The reinforcing
well then they'd find out because it

55
00:04:46,70 --> 00:04:50,72
would come to the surface by virtue of
the rush would find its way through. So

56
00:04:51,88 --> 00:04:57,06
there was only ever one instance of
it as far as i knew and they had

57
00:04:57,06 --> 00:05:03,90
a chisel in and find the offending
rod and cut it out and that was it.

58
00:05:04,95 --> 00:05:11,35
Now this is just not done any more. I don't
know i mean all that fancy work with

59
00:05:11,35 --> 00:05:17,22
the bulls eyes i believe you call
it. Yes yes that was all. Well done

60
00:05:18,88 --> 00:05:21,76
with the age or we call it

61
00:05:21,76 --> 00:05:28,71
a mould. And as far as the ball driver is

62
00:05:28,71 --> 00:05:32,13
concerned you try and your
center. And you drive

63
00:05:32,13 --> 00:05:38,01
a plug in wouldn't plug in and be able to
set your center then. And then you'd work

64
00:05:38,01 --> 00:05:39,98
work on the cement you were putting on

65
00:05:39,98 --> 00:05:46,69
a nephew revolve the little gage mould
it would cut itself out into the

66
00:05:46,69 --> 00:05:53,12
shape. You have never seen that done
myself at all. Yeah and all this. As i say

67
00:05:53,12 --> 00:05:53,86
there isn't much of

68
00:05:53,86 --> 00:06:00,66
a done anymore and. Well for my part
i'm sorry to say it. Died out because

69
00:06:00,66 --> 00:06:06,85
it was some beautiful work destroyed to
put up some of these glass and concrete

70
00:06:06,85 --> 00:06:08,47
jungles that they've got out

71
00:06:08,47 --> 00:06:13,79
a day that nothing nothing only that compares
with the work that we did on some of

72
00:06:13,79 --> 00:06:19,68
these buildings and. The one that i
have in mind in particular was the the

73
00:06:21,34 --> 00:06:26,32
grand central otel in clarence
street right opposite the g.p.o.

74
00:06:26,32 --> 00:06:31,32
You look down barrack street
and i could see the g.p.o.

75
00:06:31,33 --> 00:06:34,16
Clock and that's why they call
it the grand central. But it was

76
00:06:34,16 --> 00:06:41,12
a beautiful illustration of the work we did
and they just treated as though it was

77
00:06:41,12 --> 00:06:47,20
rubbish you know. Do you remember any
other big jobs you did in the city. Yes i

78
00:06:47,20 --> 00:06:53,29
worked on dimmick book cade. I worked on

79
00:06:54,31 --> 00:07:00,01
farmers at the corner. George and
george in market street in those days.

80
00:07:01,77 --> 00:07:07,32
The first job i worked on was the city
tattersalls club in pitch street.

81
00:07:09,06 --> 00:07:11,66
And it was it was

82
00:07:11,66 --> 00:07:18,32
a case of they dug down to get the
counterbalances for the lift and

83
00:07:19,70 --> 00:07:26,34
they dug down and struck the tank stream
and when i look back on it now. It was so

84
00:07:26,34 --> 00:07:32,62
primitive. That they bailed out. They
bailed the well out every morning with two

85
00:07:32,62 --> 00:07:39,21
full gallon kerosene tins and then
think about into street. And they

86
00:07:40,02 --> 00:07:42,18
. They were in really

87
00:07:42,18 --> 00:07:48,81
a quandary. But i was only an apprentice
at the time and i was working with

88
00:07:48,81 --> 00:07:53,71
a scotchman and the they were running
about panic stricken and the

89
00:07:56,99 --> 00:08:01,89
scotsman said of the boss when they
said you have in trouble with a with

90
00:08:01,90 --> 00:08:06,51
a lift. Well he said yeah we struck the pst
thank stream. Well he said i'll fix it

91
00:08:06,51 --> 00:08:07,59
up for a cut for

92
00:08:07,59 --> 00:08:13,25
a bottle of whiskey. He said look if you
can fix that up. He said i'll give you

93
00:08:13,25 --> 00:08:19,51
a case a whisky and so anyway i
said. Right. Oh he should give me

94
00:08:19,51 --> 00:08:24,87
a way for about three hours and he said
i'll fix up. You said i may go up. I'm

95
00:08:24,87 --> 00:08:30,49
a carrot and get fourteen pound of washing
soda and get the get the big in those

96
00:08:30,49 --> 00:08:37,20
days we were that primitive you know way
they old time washing the boiler the women

97
00:08:37,20 --> 00:08:42,26
the copper composite the women we had their
houses but we used to use one of them

98
00:08:43,37 --> 00:08:50,19
and. Anyway we got the copper boil through
the washing soda into it. You got to

99
00:08:51,04 --> 00:08:55,22
hear that they were under great bags of
cement in those two rows you get what they

100
00:08:55,22 --> 00:09:01,52
call neat cement. Emptied two of them out
in the on the floor and got to lave us to

101
00:09:01,52 --> 00:09:06,50
quick makes it and the boy put the boiling
water into this thing he found out why

102
00:09:06,50 --> 00:09:12,18
prior while we were doing all this he found
out where the drain was coming from he

103
00:09:12,19 --> 00:09:12,43
drove

104
00:09:12,43 --> 00:09:17,30
a hardwood plug up that how then he poured
all the stuff in and it come up like

105
00:09:17,30 --> 00:09:23,93
a big cloud of steam. Now why never any
more leaks. I think it was delicious little

106
00:09:23,93 --> 00:09:28,40
work. He got a case of
scotch and i got bob. To

107
00:09:28,40 --> 00:09:30,40
a dispended to bourbon. Yes that was

108
00:09:30,40 --> 00:09:33,77
a point there where it was valuable i'll
tell your table i mean i don't know what

109
00:09:33,77 --> 00:09:34,63
it's like not to have

110
00:09:34,63 --> 00:09:39,55
a table. You know. When you were working
on the bridge approach is do you member

111
00:09:39,55 --> 00:09:45,85
any other people working with you. Yes i
i. But i haven't seen them. It wasn't long

112
00:09:45,85 --> 00:09:49,76
after i finished on the bridge that i
decided i'd try and find something else.

113
00:09:49,88 --> 00:09:53,60
Shall i. I got and i got a job
looking after a building in the city

114
00:09:53,60 --> 00:09:54,59
a look. Take of

115
00:09:54,59 --> 00:10:01,32
a building so i'll cut my
connections with the union or.

116
00:10:01,34 --> 00:10:08,20
Do you remember any accidents on
that job. Well though i don't

117
00:10:08,20 --> 00:10:14,73
know any accidents as far as the
the plasters were concerned but i

118
00:10:16,48 --> 00:10:17,37
lived next door to

119
00:10:17,37 --> 00:10:23,69
a chap that worked on the bridge and. He
fell off and was killed and his name was

120
00:10:23,69 --> 00:10:30,08
faulkner. So if in your list there
you'll probably find that even as

121
00:10:30,08 --> 00:10:30,69
a man that left

122
00:10:30,69 --> 00:10:38,82
a wife and three or four children.
Yes i have my list. Well do

123
00:10:38,82 --> 00:10:42,06
you remember their working conditions on
the job or was just an ordinary sort of

124
00:10:42,06 --> 00:10:48,28
building jobs was your concern. No no.
I doubt it at its compensations in one

125
00:10:48,28 --> 00:10:52,48
regard we were out in the open air all the
time when you weren't working in ankle

126
00:10:52,48 --> 00:10:56,84
deep in water as most times we were
on buildings you know because we use

127
00:10:56,84 --> 00:10:58,13
a lot of water use

128
00:10:58,13 --> 00:11:02,93
a lot of water in our game. How so. The
conditions were better for you do you have

129
00:11:02,93 --> 00:11:08,61
a lunch room or anything
like oh no no you you

130
00:11:11,06 --> 00:11:17,88
not go off at midday and 12:25 you your
honor i'm not i began to it and then went

131
00:11:17,88 --> 00:11:24,15
on till five o'clock. But i must tell you
if i worked on marcus clarke's job at the

132
00:11:24,96 --> 00:11:31,25
railway square and it was the the

133
00:11:32,53 --> 00:11:39,41
form of things in those days they
supply sixpenny poker on the job. Well

134
00:11:39,42 --> 00:11:43,80
they were playing sixpenny poker this
particular day and there were six of them in

135
00:11:43,80 --> 00:11:49,59
it but one break out of the kiddie and they
found out they were sixpence short and

136
00:11:49,60 --> 00:11:53,31
i know well they were all put their money
and but but there were still six men

137
00:11:53,31 --> 00:11:57,29
short. Well one bloke grabbed sixpence and
the other when other bloke grabbed six

138
00:11:57,29 --> 00:12:01,35
months and that's how much i thought of
sixpence and there's no you know. Well it

139
00:12:01,35 --> 00:12:05,93
turned out into a real
brawl. Because somebody put

140
00:12:05,93 --> 00:12:10,37
a sixpence in and didn't get it back and
he was terribly peeved so yeah that'll be

141
00:12:10,37 --> 00:12:17,36
a real brawl over that. So the steward
brothers what they decided that no more

142
00:12:17,36 --> 00:12:21,55
card playing on the job. Yeah

143
00:12:21,56 --> 00:12:27,41
a group. Given what happened to you after
you finished up on the bridge approaches

144
00:12:27,41 --> 00:12:32,80
. Yes that was a time when i was
offered a job as a caretaker of

145
00:12:32,80 --> 00:12:39,28
a building in the city and that would be
right back. Or the early part of the war

146
00:12:41,27 --> 00:12:47,27
and you really were working after 1930
to on the bridge where you know i was

147
00:12:47,27 --> 00:12:52,04
working out not about 1931 i not cross work
and then i then about by thirty two. I

148
00:12:52,04 --> 00:12:55,31
got a i got a job. I got this job
offered to me as a caretaker of

149
00:12:55,31 --> 00:12:59,32
a building. So i took it on. So you were
never on the dole. You're never out of

150
00:12:59,32 --> 00:13:03,53
work. Now i was i was out
of i was out of work for

151
00:13:03,53 --> 00:13:09,69
a long time prior to that. I know who
all was from 1928 when i come out of my

152
00:13:09,69 --> 00:13:14,73
apprenticeship. I didn't pick out i did
very well for the first twelve months then

153
00:13:14,73 --> 00:13:18,41
after that the bottom fell out of the
building trade and that's when the depression

154
00:13:18,41 --> 00:13:25,23
got which worst. And that's they're
about nineteen nineteen twenty nine i

155
00:13:25,23 --> 00:13:25,43
got

156
00:13:25,43 --> 00:13:32,32
a job with the on the bridge through
the union being on the roster. So

157
00:13:32,33 --> 00:13:37,24
you were you on the dole before you went
on the bridge. Oh yes oh yes i was i was

158
00:13:37,24 --> 00:13:41,15
getting me seven and six months worth
of coupons that narrow what half

159
00:13:41,16 --> 00:13:44,13
a loaf of bread and a tin
of plum jam on a half

160
00:13:44,13 --> 00:13:48,23
a pound of butter and i think it didn't
allow for much other pound a great half

161
00:13:48,23 --> 00:13:49,75
a pound of gravy beef i think it was

162
00:13:49,75 --> 00:13:55,95
a. What it used for money
for cooking. Well i was

163
00:13:56,83 --> 00:13:57,73
fortunate enough to be

164
00:13:57,73 --> 00:14:02,36
a single boy at that time when i lived at
home when i cause i out there were more

165
00:14:02,36 --> 00:14:06,98
or less take it out of the gas and my mother
paid the bills. So was your father at

166
00:14:06,98 --> 00:14:12,48
work in those days. Now they got. Mine

167
00:14:12,48 --> 00:14:19,34
a silicosis and he was very bad with
it and he was dead at sixty. So he

168
00:14:19,34 --> 00:14:24,73
died before that time did he. Yes he died
before the war began. So you and your

169
00:14:24,73 --> 00:14:30,28
mother were getting by on the dole. Were
you. Yes yes. Nothing else later on.

170
00:14:32,35 --> 00:14:37,99
The miners federation took my father's
case up and against the mine owners and.

171
00:14:40,39 --> 00:14:45,13
They finished up. He was one of the
first cases i think that the miners

172
00:14:45,13 --> 00:14:52,07
a decided to make this an issue
and. So they. The courts

173
00:14:54,00 --> 00:14:57,79
decided that the miners that were
suffering from this complaint it was an

174
00:14:57,79 --> 00:15:02,27
industrial disease and they were to be
paid. But that was when the workers

175
00:15:02,27 --> 00:15:06,40
compensation started in one in twenty six.
That was getting around about that yes.

176
00:15:06,84 --> 00:15:13,61
And then they they gave him
up about £3 a week for

177
00:15:13,61 --> 00:15:17,30
a while and then one particular
day he went to campbell of

178
00:15:17,30 --> 00:15:21,65
a building in the city to get eased by and
they said no not weren't paying any more

179
00:15:21,65 --> 00:15:23,04
. And they were that's when
they were going to make

180
00:15:23,04 --> 00:15:29,86
a court case of it and they
were they won out and they

181
00:15:30,61 --> 00:15:32,71
got him to sign

182
00:15:32,72 --> 00:15:39,00
a form and they paid him up 500

183
00:15:39,01 --> 00:15:45,87
pound. Now the minus federation
that they performed about that and

184
00:15:45,87 --> 00:15:48,30
but they said well he'd signed
the document not to make

185
00:15:48,30 --> 00:15:53,33
a c c and he was illiterate. He never been
to school and i didn't know what he was

186
00:15:54,16 --> 00:16:00,18
doing and it because he thought you know
doing the right thing by filling in this

187
00:16:00,18 --> 00:16:07,11
form and. Anyway i giving £500 and

188
00:16:07,11 --> 00:16:11,34
shutting down but after that
the miners were getting

189
00:16:12,37 --> 00:16:17,93
a weekly wage getting a weekly allowance
and that amounted to about £4

190
00:16:17,93 --> 00:16:19,89
a week. Here's

191
00:16:19,89 --> 00:16:24,48
a that's correct. And when they died of
silicosis they were getting between four

192
00:16:24,48 --> 00:16:25,68
hundred eight hundred pounds

193
00:16:25,68 --> 00:16:31,69
a widow was well i think i
got to get £500 for four

194
00:16:33,34 --> 00:16:36,09
as a compensation but the e

195
00:16:37,65 --> 00:16:41,17
e except the 500 because he was it was
like that they didn't know what they were

196
00:16:41,17 --> 00:16:46,68
doing but he said it was just as well.
They get the £500 and hope for the best.

197
00:16:46,70 --> 00:16:53,42
Tell me what when did your
father die. But about 1939.

198
00:16:54,05 --> 00:17:00,36
So your father was at home when this was i
knew you were the only money coming in.

199
00:17:00,36 --> 00:17:07,32
Other than the compensation. Yes yes.
Right. So you know. Yes you were

200
00:17:07,32 --> 00:17:12,13
on the right. And then then you were picked
up from the harbour bridge and that was

201
00:17:12,13 --> 00:17:17,38
the start of your blustering career service
break up do what i do you term. Yes yes

202
00:17:18,54 --> 00:17:25,27
yes as i say from 1929 up
to about nineteen thirty i.

203
00:17:25,29 --> 00:17:27,53
sixteen months and didn't pick up

204
00:17:27,53 --> 00:17:33,55
a trail. Tell me do you remember any amusing
incidents really working around the

205
00:17:33,55 --> 00:17:40,53
bridge area. Well i can
remember an incident

206
00:17:40,53 --> 00:17:47,36
but it wasn't amusing and it was when it
used to cost you tuppence to go that there

207
00:17:47,36 --> 00:17:53,43
was some building going on it. North one
day and i called about but ben buchler in

208
00:17:53,43 --> 00:18:00,34
those days and i borrowed tuppence from my
mother to go across to our second street

209
00:18:00,34 --> 00:18:05,41
where the ferry used to leave from balmain
to go to work in st. And i followed the

210
00:18:05,41 --> 00:18:06,69
frame line from

211
00:18:06,69 --> 00:18:13,23
a second street out to ben
buchler and i got a got

212
00:18:13,23 --> 00:18:14,92
a start as a plaster on a on

213
00:18:14,92 --> 00:18:20,57
a block of flats that was going out there
and. The job only lasted two days.

214
00:18:22,46 --> 00:18:28,44
That was before the bridge or after. That
would be after i should think. Yes. After

215
00:18:29,33 --> 00:18:33,92
but i wasn't sorry to get
leave they tried it it was

216
00:18:33,92 --> 00:18:38,37
a pretty hard going to
remember seeing bradfield or

217
00:18:38,37 --> 00:18:42,95
a movie on the other engineers around
the job. Oh yes. Often they come more

218
00:18:42,95 --> 00:18:47,82
particularly on monday morning
and look around and see

219
00:18:50,03 --> 00:18:55,34
how you were going in command us on our
work and all that sort of thing. And

220
00:18:55,34 --> 00:19:01,80
getting towards the end i remember quite
well the pay cut used to come up on

221
00:19:01,80 --> 00:19:06,34
a friday afternoon need you need go
right up to the to the steel work.

222
00:19:08,30 --> 00:19:14,49
And on particular friday afternoon the panic
and boss we call them. He came along i

223
00:19:14,49 --> 00:19:20,91
mean he said the play cards up at the
ironworks and he said i. I'll go up and

224
00:19:20,91 --> 00:19:27,57
telling to wait for you and i said and.
Right. Oh so you went up there and by that

225
00:19:27,57 --> 00:19:33,93
time i got the panel finished everything
was okay so i set off to go up the aisle

226
00:19:33,93 --> 00:19:40,87
and work and. When i got asked
way up. He was coming down

227
00:19:40,87 --> 00:19:47,73
and he said i don't want to wait and
see it right. Oh so i went up and

228
00:19:47,73 --> 00:19:53,11
got me pay out me on polite when it was ok
and i'm walking back onto the job and he

229
00:19:53,12 --> 00:19:56,69
hasn't moved from where i
first. And he said i'm

230
00:19:56,69 --> 00:20:03,02
a playwright and i said yes he
said if you got nine ten bob

231
00:20:04,80 --> 00:20:11,51
and i knew i knew what he was at and i
said i said there's no ten bob and my own

232
00:20:11,51 --> 00:20:17,59
pillow boy he said will you
finish tonight and i said good

233
00:20:19,08 --> 00:20:22,87
for those that might be interested. Namely
run one tear down one. I'll never forget

234
00:20:22,87 --> 00:20:29,51
him. Did you finish that night. Yet i
finished up that friday night and that was

235
00:20:29,51 --> 00:20:35,69
that was your finish on the bridge
fix without the you must have been.

236
00:20:36,19 --> 00:20:42,33
You remember that for the rest of your life
and my word. And i don't think he ever

237
00:20:42,33 --> 00:20:45,59
prospered after that because that
was it was a common thing you know

238
00:20:45,59 --> 00:20:49,86
a lot of it was going on in the
trade generally speaking and he was

239
00:20:49,86 --> 00:20:53,51
a going for the public works
was a it was what they call

240
00:20:53,51 --> 00:20:57,41
a panic and was. Why we're
to get the man without

241
00:20:57,41 --> 00:21:02,27
a plan to converse that i couldn't tell you
but you know you know you see the panic

242
00:21:02,27 --> 00:21:07,51
and worse i see here is the panic and bush
coming in. Oh. Well there was only one

243
00:21:07,51 --> 00:21:10,87
form in that and that was the bloke we
took you on that was named sheppard wasn't

244
00:21:10,87 --> 00:21:11,85
it. But yes he was

245
00:21:11,85 --> 00:21:15,28
a man that was in charge of that section
there where we were he was quite

246
00:21:15,28 --> 00:21:20,04
a decent bloke but the other bloke i
couldn't say that for him right. The name of

247
00:21:20,04 --> 00:21:25,82
ted and when.

248
00:21:27,16 --> 00:21:27,35
That's

249
00:21:27,36 --> 00:21:32,21
a story as well as the body else situations
like where do you anybody when you do

250
00:21:32,21 --> 00:21:38,86
you talk to the others. Now i didn't
bother for the simple reason that i didn't

251
00:21:38,86 --> 00:21:44,56
know how many were doing it but i wasn't
doing it and they said well why didn't you

252
00:21:44,56 --> 00:21:48,79
complain i said for the simple reason
you're shrewd enough to catch me in

253
00:21:48,79 --> 00:21:54,06
a position where we had where i had no
witnesses and they could deny what i was

254
00:21:54,06 --> 00:22:00,56
saying and i'd have no i wouldn't have
nothing concrete nothing in black and white

255
00:22:00,56 --> 00:22:06,70
naturally to prove that what i said
was right but that i gained nothing

256
00:22:07,42 --> 00:22:10,57
nothing. Concocting

257
00:22:10,58 --> 00:22:17,16
a story like that and that
was an actual fact. That's

258
00:22:17,17 --> 00:22:24,13
a good number of years ago. Yes it
certainly is. It's well fifty years.

259
00:22:25,94 --> 00:22:29,01
Through it's fifty one years isn't it.
You could have had another years work on

260
00:22:29,01 --> 00:22:35,08
there i suppose. Yeah well my
yes yes but i think you know

261
00:22:35,97 --> 00:22:42,63
they had it worked on this system that
the first to come. The last to come the

262
00:22:42,63 --> 00:22:49,43
first to go. There is the usual
thing you know. Do you remember

263
00:22:49,43 --> 00:22:54,89
anything about any of the other public
works people the engineers now. Now they

264
00:22:54,89 --> 00:22:59,00
keep strictly themselves you know and what
they were but it was strange. You know

265
00:22:59,00 --> 00:23:05,90
when we were working on the push and there
was very little interference or anybody

266
00:23:05,91 --> 00:23:10,30
coming around. We knew the job was there
and we just got on from one job to another

267
00:23:10,30 --> 00:23:16,41
until it was completed the bloke you
called a panic in boss he was was he

268
00:23:16,41 --> 00:23:23,17
a plasterer. Yes but they didn't do any
plastering but he just stood over you just

269
00:23:23,17 --> 00:23:29,89
walked around you know he walked
and. He walked around you know

270
00:23:30,75 --> 00:23:35,34
trying to catch up on you and i must tell
you an incident we were working pretty

271
00:23:35,34 --> 00:23:40,53
high with the walls got very high when
you got near the steelworks. And we only

272
00:23:40,53 --> 00:23:45,51
work and we worked on two planks you see.
And of course as i told you before water

273
00:23:45,51 --> 00:23:52,06
was very necessary. And i know one bloke.

274
00:23:53,44 --> 00:23:58,34
He didn't like that's following that and
what he did he put the kerosene down so

275
00:23:58,34 --> 00:24:04,08
that if the kerosene ten was on one plank
and after it on the other plank well he

276
00:24:04,08 --> 00:24:08,89
tried down pretty everyone plank and i
went there kerosene. And the black was

277
00:24:08,89 --> 00:24:09,91
underneath and he copped

278
00:24:09,91 --> 00:24:16,83
a lot. Who was underneath and went.
What was the kerosene for now

279
00:24:16,83 --> 00:24:17,09
it was

280
00:24:17,09 --> 00:24:21,46
a kerosene tin you know squeak kerosene
things we used to use and i was like kerosene

281
00:24:21,46 --> 00:24:26,06
too full of water. Yes and over it went
down where it went on him and he said you

282
00:24:26,06 --> 00:24:32,23
did that on purpose. Do you
remember did you plaster around the

283
00:24:33,53 --> 00:24:40,52
great big arch at fitzroy street. Now
we didn't get up that far. I didn't get

284
00:24:40,52 --> 00:24:47,41
up that far i was down to
as far as the walls there

285
00:24:47,41 --> 00:24:53,58
entering north sydney side no no. Sydney
station. But i know they are you referring

286
00:24:53,58 --> 00:24:55,30
to. That's

287
00:24:55,30 --> 00:24:59,78
a terrible big arch that that was done prior
to make me going there. I think that i

288
00:24:59,78 --> 00:25:05,31
think there was an accident there as well.
So you wouldn't remember that either. It

289
00:25:05,31 --> 00:25:05,37
was

290
00:25:05,37 --> 00:25:12,58
a carpenter got killed. Now i i don't
remember that. Yes. Could you remember

291
00:25:12,58 --> 00:25:19,03
any other incidents that stand out in
your mind. When you were working on the

292
00:25:19,03 --> 00:25:24,97
bridge were there any toilet arrangements
at the time. No none whatever you did the

293
00:25:24,97 --> 00:25:29,85
best you could you got around the corner
or something like that and it was it was

294
00:25:29,86 --> 00:25:35,05
that was that the same one other jobs.
Well there was another job. I remember we

295
00:25:35,05 --> 00:25:41,70
were putting dummy ceilings in in the
interior of anthony auden's as it was in

296
00:25:41,70 --> 00:25:47,22
those days covering up all that multitude
of pipes and. Wires and one thing and

297
00:25:47,22 --> 00:25:53,42
another and i'd only just started
on the job and. I had an answer.

298
00:25:53,63 --> 00:25:57,34
What are nature's calls
and i said i went down on

299
00:25:57,34 --> 00:26:00,96
a ten foot ladder to get to the bottom the
panic and bosses waiting for me and he

300
00:26:00,96 --> 00:26:03,57
said. Where are you going.
And i said well i know for

301
00:26:03,57 --> 00:26:09,81
a leak. He said oh i said yes
the gays but what's that.

302
00:26:09,98 --> 00:26:11,20
Well that was

303
00:26:11,20 --> 00:26:18,10
a stuff we you see when the labor brings
you material up onto the scaffold. It

304
00:26:18,11 --> 00:26:23,17
may not be that the consistency that you
want to work at so you're using gauge but

305
00:26:23,17 --> 00:26:26,89
to break it down oil mix it
up and make it pliable. It's

306
00:26:26,89 --> 00:26:32,10
a pot of water. Yeah but you use the pot
of water to pour into the cement that they

307
00:26:32,10 --> 00:26:35,29
put on that day and they
make it up into. As i said

308
00:26:35,29 --> 00:26:40,33
a type that was easy to work with. Anyway

309
00:26:42,78 --> 00:26:48,92
this mannequin bushes and in those
days they built the scaffold.

310
00:26:49,29 --> 00:26:56,16
Plank to plank all the way across so that
the merchandise underneath wouldn't get

311
00:26:57,08 --> 00:27:04,04
damaged. And then on top of
that flooring of planks that

312
00:27:04,04 --> 00:27:07,43
where we put a big shade over they put

313
00:27:07,43 --> 00:27:13,94
a big sheet of canvas there. And then they
on top of the canvas they put sawdust.

314
00:27:13,95 --> 00:27:19,78
That would like soak up any
water or anything. I don't. And

315
00:27:21,20 --> 00:27:28,17
anyway i had another job in mind and
i was going to take that you know so

316
00:27:28,17 --> 00:27:32,34
about ten minutes after or now and again
they said we're going now. I said well i

317
00:27:32,34 --> 00:27:35,50
want us to go on and they aren't and nature's
god he said when you're finished. He

318
00:27:35,50 --> 00:27:39,79
said go and get your money
you're finished. And it's

319
00:27:39,79 --> 00:27:45,51
a hard time when were you finished. Yes oh
yes they weren't getting they were even

320
00:27:45,51 --> 00:27:51,02
that tough you know. I don't smoke but the
man that smokes. He knew full well that

321
00:27:51,02 --> 00:27:56,49
a he can't you know can't stand making
cigarettes. They let you smoke on condition

322
00:27:56,49 --> 00:27:57,68
you've already go there with

323
00:27:57,68 --> 00:28:04,65
a team full of ready money not ready
made but and made cigarettes. It

324
00:28:05,93 --> 00:28:09,46
was pretty hard. What about the other
while you were on the bridge. What about

325
00:28:09,46 --> 00:28:14,08
other things the conditions for for instance
was there anywhere you could get hot

326
00:28:14,08 --> 00:28:18,01
water to make tea at lunchtime. Yes they
are they out of place they were they boil

327
00:28:18,01 --> 00:28:23,98
a big building and a fellow would come
and he'd take you billy can and make

328
00:28:23,98 --> 00:28:30,83
a cup of tea and put it all down on me and
we. We more or less used to sit in an

329
00:28:30,83 --> 00:28:37,77
old shed you know but you know no chairs
or forms or anything like that. You

330
00:28:37,77 --> 00:28:43,85
sat on the floor. Yes. And what
about working out in the weather

331
00:28:44,97 --> 00:28:49,21
when it was wet. I suppose you couldn't
work. Well then you wouldn't it was only

332
00:28:49,21 --> 00:28:54,43
very rare occasions when you know you could
work sometimes if you were working on

333
00:28:54,43 --> 00:29:00,73
a section that was. It was probable that
they the rain would interfere with their

334
00:29:00,73 --> 00:29:02,00
work well. Put over

335
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:07,00
a big pole and something like that but
generally speaking if it if it rain. You

336
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:13,37
were rained off and that is where you lost
and that's where the plaster lost the he

337
00:29:13,37 --> 00:29:17,14
didn't get paid for that because he was he
wasn't working nights i'm your friend if

338
00:29:17,14 --> 00:29:24,03
i die and that was it. He didn't get the
first hour waiting on the company's time

339
00:29:24,86 --> 00:29:28,41
you know when on the bridge they did they
got one hour and accompanies me and after

340
00:29:28,41 --> 00:29:32,98
that there one hour on the other and then
you were up. That's right. So it must. So

341
00:29:32,98 --> 00:29:36,38
in actual fact it was harder on the working
for the public works than it was for

342
00:29:36,38 --> 00:29:42,75
dorman long. Oh well i wouldn't know about
that because they were different and

343
00:29:43,70 --> 00:29:47,80
different crowd altogether i don't
know what they were like well that was

344
00:29:47,80 --> 00:29:51,61
a rule on. Dorman long some of the blokes
you think were pretty good because the

345
00:29:51,61 --> 00:29:53,11
first hour you waited for group was

346
00:29:53,11 --> 00:29:57,29
a room. You waited and you were paid for
it. The second hour. You waited and you

347
00:29:57,29 --> 00:29:59,63
weren't paid for it and after that you
were knocked off for the day or whatever.

348
00:30:01,38 --> 00:30:08,36
Yes well we never got paid if
we were off but i i cannot

349
00:30:08,36 --> 00:30:11,28
because getting back a long time. I
can't just remember where there was

350
00:30:11,28 --> 00:30:17,97
a day's rain or two days rain but i do
know that the if you were if it rain too

351
00:30:17,97 --> 00:30:23,23
long to ever you well then that was
it you knocked off and that was it.
