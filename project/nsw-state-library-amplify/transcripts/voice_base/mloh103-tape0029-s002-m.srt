1
00:00:17,40 --> 00:00:23,81
Here. Well tangible has a way of
screening people i guess you'd say

2
00:00:23,81 --> 00:00:26,89
and that is that anybody
that wants to move on to

3
00:00:26,89 --> 00:00:29,92
that community has to meet the tribe and.

4
00:00:30,43 --> 00:00:33,70
And it's got briefly who they
are and what they're on about.

5
00:00:34,13 --> 00:00:37,76
And then it's up to the
tribe and the hamlet

6
00:00:37,76 --> 00:00:42,49
that you're actually moving on to so
when i moved onto the hamlet of pala.

7
00:00:42,64 --> 00:00:45,63
I had to meet all the
neighbors and talk with them.

8
00:00:45,80 --> 00:00:49,93
It was a safety mechanism for me
because i could soon start out

9
00:00:49,93 --> 00:00:55,11
that i wasn't living next door
to a home with a shotgun. And.

10
00:00:56,08 --> 00:00:57,16
They could soon start out

11
00:00:57,16 --> 00:01:02,02
that i was a peace loving hippie type
too so it was a great safety valve

12
00:01:02,80 --> 00:01:04,40
and then for buying a house there.

13
00:01:05,02 --> 00:01:08,29
It's a matter of having to rent
there first for 12 months.

14
00:01:08,99 --> 00:01:10,80
And i think i feel that's really good

15
00:01:10,80 --> 00:01:14,69
and i'm sure that's why the
families are so contented

16
00:01:14,69 --> 00:01:18,65
and i don't have to carry a great
deal of defence around with them.

17
00:01:19,64 --> 00:01:24,61
My house powers like i think 98 percent of
the houses on tangible it doesn't have a

18
00:01:24,61 --> 00:01:27,57
lock and.

19
00:01:27,59 --> 00:01:33,26
I've never had any trouble with people using
the house if you're walking by people

20
00:01:33,26 --> 00:01:34,40
might use you dani.

21
00:01:34,55 --> 00:01:38,46
But they're certainly not in your
living room or having cups of tea

22
00:01:41,15 --> 00:01:44,84
or stealing things i've had no
trouble with they're my motorbike

23
00:01:44,84 --> 00:01:46,38
that they're my house.

24
00:01:46,51 --> 00:01:57,69
They're quite unlike what.

25
00:01:58,67 --> 00:02:02,98
Well yeah. Most of the houses
the set back into a rainforest

26
00:02:02,98 --> 00:02:07,55
and so they're very private and although
our neighbours are quite close.

27
00:02:07,59 --> 00:02:11,60
We can't actually see them if
i was to yell off my veranda.

28
00:02:11,79 --> 00:02:15,77
They might hear me and i can certainly
hear one of my neighbours being often

29
00:02:15,77 --> 00:02:22,75
and playing the guitar. Fortunately has
a good voice and plays guitar. Well.

30
00:02:22,77 --> 00:02:27,93
But yeah it's rainforest it it becomes
quite leeches in the wet season

31
00:02:28,93 --> 00:02:33,56
and we have about eight or 12
weeks of that each year and.

32
00:02:33,58 --> 00:02:37,08
So they can get a bit muddy
underfoot rain boots country

33
00:02:37,82 --> 00:02:38,88
but for the rest of the years.

34
00:02:38,95 --> 00:02:42,58
Very beautiful and we have many
trees from all over the world

35
00:02:42,58 --> 00:02:45,66
and coffee's ground there. And so and.

36
00:02:46,30 --> 00:02:48,37
Lots of exotic plants

37
00:02:48,37 --> 00:02:52,73
that you don't see in many places
other than the potential garden and.

38
00:02:53,01 --> 00:02:54,94
And it is this love for the earth

39
00:02:54,94 --> 00:02:59,24
that people have brought back things
from other countries and grown up there

40
00:02:59,24 --> 00:03:05,10
and it's fantastic.

41
00:03:05,11 --> 00:03:11,94
For. Less.

42
00:03:11,96 --> 00:03:18,10
So yes we have a tribal council which
is very similar to any council

43
00:03:18,10 --> 00:03:22,74
that looks after a body of
people and the tribe insists

44
00:03:22,74 --> 00:03:27,92
that there's no real profit
making on real estate there. So.

45
00:03:27,93 --> 00:03:32,96
The house that i'm in has a set price and.

46
00:03:32,97 --> 00:03:35,10
The owner couldn't put upon herself

47
00:03:35,10 --> 00:03:40,39
that it was worth twenty thousand more
because neighbors neighbours houses there

48
00:03:40,39 --> 00:03:45,26
were twenty thousand more. It hasn't
gone up with the rest of inflation.

49
00:03:45,66 --> 00:03:50,91
And so the average house there would be
about twenty ten to twenty thousand dollars

50
00:03:52,05 --> 00:03:55,47
which is very realistic in this neighborhood
because if you're looking at a few

51
00:03:55,47 --> 00:03:59,64
acres on your own with a comfortable dwelling
you might be looking at seventy four.

52
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,55
He's thousand dollars makes it very
realistic for young parents to move on

53
00:04:06,28 --> 00:04:09,85
and to want to start having
children because they haven't got

54
00:04:09,85 --> 00:04:12,93
that huge mortgage to have
to worry about or attend to.

55
00:04:14,28 --> 00:04:17,01
And it means to a lot more
time spent with the children

56
00:04:17,01 --> 00:04:21,99
and i think that's why the kids are walking
around quite contented they do see a

57
00:04:21,99 --> 00:04:23,49
lot of dad and they do see a lot of.

58
00:04:24,16 --> 00:04:30,59
And it's grace.

59
00:04:30,61 --> 00:04:32,89
Oh yes there's a share.

60
00:04:32,97 --> 00:04:39,72
It's a share system and to buy shares
intangible a share cost $500 deal.

61
00:04:39,98 --> 00:04:43,09
And i'm sure that's been a
stable price now for 10.

62
00:04:43,59 --> 00:04:44,84
10 years or 15 years

63
00:04:44,84 --> 00:04:49,39
or even the whole existence of it has most
probably been something very realistic

64
00:04:49,39 --> 00:04:50,01
like

65
00:04:50,01 --> 00:04:56,86
that.

66
00:04:56,88 --> 00:05:01,68
You know.

67
00:05:01,70 --> 00:05:05,29
Places.

68
00:05:06,35 --> 00:05:12,30
People.

69
00:05:13,25 --> 00:05:15,14
My views on poverty.

70
00:05:15,16 --> 00:05:18,21
But happiness and joy

71
00:05:18,91 --> 00:05:24,47
and i see a lot of happiness there and
no i don't see a lot of new commodores

72
00:05:24,47 --> 00:05:27,40
or shiny lawnmowers that you see it on

73
00:05:27,40 --> 00:05:32,37
and i get values are looked upon slightly
different than how they may be looked

74
00:05:32,37 --> 00:05:38,80
upon in it's easy where the
news is certainly a value on

75
00:05:38,81 --> 00:05:42,13
tangible. I guess we'll fortunate
to have two or four wheels

76
00:05:42,13 --> 00:05:46,63
that are still managing to get across the
road to get the kids after high school

77
00:05:46,63 --> 00:05:53,45
or to get around to do the shopping. But
the community self is actually very good.

78
00:05:53,69 --> 00:05:59,66
It had its own bus service its own bus
shelter and that's set up for people that.

79
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,24
Haven't got cars for the single mum
that don't have cars for the kids

80
00:06:03,24 --> 00:06:05,93
that just want to go to
nimbin and play on opinion

81
00:06:05,93 --> 00:06:12,20
or whatever they consider the bus
shelter and as as a driver myself

82
00:06:12,20 --> 00:06:17,18
when i drive past the bus shelter never
sitting there like a cab rank whoever was

83
00:06:17,18 --> 00:06:21,56
there for the first one on my motorbike
riff i have room for three in my car.

84
00:06:21,94 --> 00:06:28,70
It can fit the first three in and
i've never seen people drive past me

85
00:06:28,70 --> 00:06:30,59
when i want to go to town.
If it's pouring rain.

86
00:06:30,87 --> 00:06:32,20
I don't want to sit on my motorbike.

87
00:06:32,56 --> 00:06:36,47
I said in the bus shelter and the first
car that goes past will be the car

88
00:06:36,47 --> 00:06:39,47
that picks me up and i
really like that aspect

89
00:06:39,47 --> 00:06:46,43
and likewise for the return journey from
nimbin out to tangible isn't a problem for

90
00:06:46,44 --> 00:06:52,60
lift all the time.

91
00:06:52,62 --> 00:06:56,77
Yeah. On top of all people
do share their food

92
00:06:56,77 --> 00:07:01,62
and there's a lot of food grown
there and there's massive orchards

93
00:07:01,62 --> 00:07:05,83
that aren't there to make
massive sums of money.

94
00:07:06,87 --> 00:07:10,13
They're there for people to pick
the mandarins or the peaches

95
00:07:10,13 --> 00:07:15,30
when they're riding past on their horse
or walking past on port and i like

96
00:07:15,30 --> 00:07:16,40
that idea and.

97
00:07:16,74 --> 00:07:21,91
I don't think i've ever left a neighbour
without holding on to the kini a potato

98
00:07:21,91 --> 00:07:24,80
or something and it's
usually a little bag of.

99
00:07:25,39 --> 00:07:33,17
You know vegetables which is fantastic.

100
00:07:37,05 --> 00:07:43,21
Oh yes i guess my favorite story
for tons of all would be is oh ok.

101
00:07:46,33 --> 00:07:49,05
Yeah one of the. The best times for me.

102
00:07:49,07 --> 00:07:53,30
Tangible was when i took my mother
out there with my niece and nephew.

103
00:07:53,68 --> 00:07:58,22
And they spent the day there and
we walked all over the commune

104
00:07:58,22 --> 00:07:59,83
and saw most probably 100.

105
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,41
Houses and teepees and dwellings where
people live and when will evening.

106
00:08:05,95 --> 00:08:10,42
Dawn who is quite middle class and
quite sydney said to my niece

107
00:08:10,42 --> 00:08:12,46
and nephew i bet you didn't expect

108
00:08:12,46 --> 00:08:15,73
when we drove into this valley to
meet so many interesting people

109
00:08:16,66 --> 00:08:20,36
and to see so many
beautiful dwellings and.

110
00:08:21,08 --> 00:08:23,93
I think that was a
wonderful story because.

111
00:08:24,93 --> 00:08:29,91
Dawn had never seen anything like that
before and she fell in love with it

112
00:08:29,91 --> 00:08:34,14
and i thought that was very very good
because there is no curbing gathering

113
00:08:34,14 --> 00:08:38,50
and there are no electricity power
poles running along and that.

114
00:08:38,76 --> 00:08:43,74
One can feel alienated without things i
guess after living with them to 60 years.

115
00:08:44,07 --> 00:08:46,65
Steph i don't feel very
comfortable there immediately

116
00:08:47,69 --> 00:08:54,35
and to get the vibe of the place immediately
i thought was a wonderful thing.

117
00:08:54,36 --> 00:09:07,71
Why.

118
00:09:07,72 --> 00:09:11,21
Goddy eccentricity.

119
00:09:11,22 --> 00:09:18,01
I hate to call those people that. I think.

120
00:09:18,03 --> 00:09:22,03
Most people see themselves as doing what
they want to do one of their childhood

121
00:09:22,03 --> 00:09:25,52
dreams one of their adult dreams
they can out leave it there

122
00:09:26,26 --> 00:09:30,41
and it's not a great cause like
the dream about 100 foot yacht

123
00:09:30,41 --> 00:09:37,06
or the mansion on the hill can often be
very frustrating dream because you spend a

124
00:09:37,06 --> 00:09:40,91
lifetime trying to get to that and
it tangible it's more realistic.

125
00:09:41,36 --> 00:09:42,50
So people can out.

126
00:09:42,78 --> 00:09:45,62
They can live their dream they
can bring their children up

127
00:09:46,55 --> 00:09:51,51
or in my case they can walk around feeling
very comfortable being who i am. And.

128
00:09:52,15 --> 00:09:57,21
I think that's good to have such
a neighborhood on the planet.

129
00:09:59,22 --> 00:10:02,41
Yet i think that. All intangible do
you have a very high level of talent

130
00:10:02,41 --> 00:10:13,29
and it's great.

131
00:10:14,72 --> 00:10:16,17
I'm sure that yeah

132
00:10:16,17 --> 00:10:23,86
when people go outside the
guidelines if they if they're not.

133
00:10:23,88 --> 00:10:27,15
If they're having problems
within their domestic life

134
00:10:27,15 --> 00:10:31,55
or within their neighbor life. It's
very common. I think on the outside.

135
00:10:32,20 --> 00:10:36,11
To just call the police
or to call an inspector

136
00:10:36,11 --> 00:10:41,91
or to get the outside to actually pay
and to work out the decision making.

137
00:10:42,17 --> 00:10:47,28
I find it tangible a lot of it's
kept within and worked out within

138
00:10:47,28 --> 00:10:51,36
and other only thing think
that story through it

139
00:10:51,36 --> 00:10:53,07
and yes it must be very frustrating.

140
00:10:53,68 --> 00:10:56,66
While those people are
in such a dilemma and

141
00:10:56,67 --> 00:10:59,38
that they certainly have the
time to persevere with it

142
00:10:59,38 --> 00:11:04,58
and give it the time to persevere
and. Yeah i've seen it work.

143
00:11:05,03 --> 00:11:11,37
It's good and. Thank you.

144
00:11:11,39 --> 00:11:15,90
So people you know.

145
00:11:15,92 --> 00:11:21,97
Do more.

146
00:11:23,92 --> 00:11:28,88
It's actually mark but even calls
me marcus. Doesn't really worry me.

147
00:11:28,95 --> 00:11:38,51
Probably not.

148
00:11:39,39 --> 00:11:42,92
Ok. Right now.

149
00:11:42,92 --> 00:11:43,36
Mark jackson

150
00:11:43,36 --> 00:11:47,42
and i moved to nimbin just because it seemed
like a nice thing to do for a weekend

151
00:11:47,42 --> 00:11:53,32
at the time and there was rides
available with the supplies truck

152
00:11:53,32 --> 00:11:58,46
that was bringing supplies down to the
crew who were making the preparations for

153
00:11:58,46 --> 00:11:59,47
the festival and.

154
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:01,10
So about two

155
00:12:01,10 --> 00:12:03,90
and a half months before the first
of all i came down for the weekend

156
00:12:03,90 --> 00:12:06,96
and 20 years down the
track. I'm still here.

157
00:12:15,02 --> 00:12:18,74
And it was really just a nice
thing to do for a weekend

158
00:12:18,74 --> 00:12:20,59
and you know nice trip to the countryside

159
00:12:20,59 --> 00:12:25,48
and i guess i just fell in love with
the environment around an indian

160
00:12:25,48 --> 00:12:29,87
and we used to come down the back
roads through the no valley so

161
00:12:29,87 --> 00:12:34,97
that even on the trip down you know it
was like going through primeval jungle

162
00:12:34,97 --> 00:12:39,14
compared to what i was used to you know
brisbane being a bit of a concrete jungle.

163
00:12:39,16 --> 00:12:40,85
So i was a complete contrast

164
00:12:40,85 --> 00:12:45,65
and i think it was really a matter of
falling in love with the environment really

165
00:12:45,65 --> 00:12:50,44
that made me enjoy coming
and cause me to stay.

166
00:12:54,96 --> 00:12:56,35
Well i think i was probably found.

167
00:12:56,58 --> 00:12:59,61
You know 10 or 15 years before
that the term was thought of.

168
00:13:01,73 --> 00:13:04,98
Living a fairly decadent lifestyle and i
think it had a lot to do with the fact

169
00:13:04,98 --> 00:13:05,29
that i saw

170
00:13:05,29 --> 00:13:11,54
that i was living in an intensely decadent
civilisation whose means of production

171
00:13:11,54 --> 00:13:15,89
was sort of based on it
on its own demise and.

172
00:13:15,91 --> 00:13:20,84
Yeah i think the concept is no
future which was the concept

173
00:13:20,84 --> 00:13:26,37
that the punk generation's sort of
brought to light was you know a strong

174
00:13:26,37 --> 00:13:30,32
perception in my life at the
time so you know basically.

175
00:13:30,34 --> 00:13:34,10
Working in a mental
hospital and drinking a lot

176
00:13:34,10 --> 00:13:37,14
and doing various other
bad things to my body

177
00:13:39,11 --> 00:13:44,68
and moving to nimbin was just like getting
back in contact with life you know sort

178
00:13:44,69 --> 00:13:51,07
of being connected with nature looking
at how useless i was probably the key

179
00:13:52,28 --> 00:13:56,77
realisation that i'd been trying
to be someone who sits at a desk

180
00:13:56,77 --> 00:13:59,87
or does something similar
to that and had no life.

181
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,84
Skills whatever in terms of
you know cooking building.

182
00:14:03,86 --> 00:14:05,10
You know doing anything

183
00:14:05,10 --> 00:14:13,20
that was immediately useful
in the survival sense.

184
00:14:16,17 --> 00:14:18,53
Well it wasn't really the
aquarius festival as such

185
00:14:18,53 --> 00:14:24,49
and in fact by the time of the equerries
first of all which is about three months

186
00:14:24,49 --> 00:14:29,17
after i arrived in nimbin i didn't bother
to go to the first of all because you

187
00:14:29,17 --> 00:14:31,48
know by then i was living in
a farmhouse outside of town

188
00:14:31,48 --> 00:14:36,87
and was so sort of in love
with survivor lifestyles

189
00:14:36,87 --> 00:14:38,64
and the back to nature movement that.

190
00:14:39,27 --> 00:14:42,32
About that we couldn't be bothered
going into town to celebrate

191
00:14:42,32 --> 00:14:45,99
that you know i was just quietly
celebrating via my self.

192
00:14:46,02 --> 00:14:46,28
The fact

193
00:14:46,28 --> 00:14:56,53
that i was living in the countryside.

194
00:14:58,06 --> 00:15:02,32
It was really a process of becoming
involved in all of the processes

195
00:15:02,32 --> 00:15:03,10
that make life possible

196
00:15:03,10 --> 00:15:07,48
and trying to get involved with
them in a you know holistic way so

197
00:15:07,49 --> 00:15:10,12
that you know recognising
that i needed to eat.

198
00:15:10,29 --> 00:15:14,62
I became involved in growing vegetables
in varying cairns in cooking

199
00:15:14,62 --> 00:15:17,42
and you know that whole process.

200
00:15:18,36 --> 00:15:19,38
And you know applying that

201
00:15:19,38 --> 00:15:23,91
that sort of holistic involvement with those
processes across all areas of my life

202
00:15:23,91 --> 00:15:30,11
and probably in particular becoming
involved in the tree cycle.

203
00:15:30,28 --> 00:15:33,22
If you like and you know

204
00:15:33,22 --> 00:15:37,26
that the first contact being wanting
to make a musical instrument.

205
00:15:37,28 --> 00:15:41,05
A guy that i knew and this is
probably six months after the first

206
00:15:41,05 --> 00:15:45,46
or so i was making dulcimers which were
forced to being a musical instrument from

207
00:15:45,46 --> 00:15:51,37
the appellation mountains making one
obviously involve getting some woodworking

208
00:15:51,37 --> 00:15:53,55
tools and among the woodworking tools but

209
00:15:53,55 --> 00:15:56,74
that i either border was
given was a chainsaw

210
00:15:56,74 --> 00:16:00,41
that i was given by the guy
called sam at. By who.

211
00:16:00,69 --> 00:16:05,72
And the sawmill at the end of all fours
co-operative property before it was the

212
00:16:05,72 --> 00:16:07,45
carnival co-op.

213
00:16:07,46 --> 00:16:12,36
He gave me a chainsaw and i was
building a house by this time

214
00:16:12,36 --> 00:16:17,49
and the guy who'd cleared a building
site with his bulldozer offered me a job

215
00:16:17,49 --> 00:16:20,54
logging and because i was
building a timber house

216
00:16:20,54 --> 00:16:23,60
and various other reasons i thought

217
00:16:23,60 --> 00:16:26,43
that it was probably the fair thing
to take the logging job so i did

218
00:16:26,43 --> 00:16:31,93
that you know worked in the timber
industry for about two years and.

219
00:16:33,65 --> 00:16:35,91
Having been involved in cutting
a lot of trees down i thought

220
00:16:35,91 --> 00:16:37,29
that i should plant sun.

221
00:16:37,46 --> 00:16:42,60
So what would have suited me at the
time was to work for the government.

222
00:16:42,80 --> 00:16:46,20
You know would rates of pay part time
and get a bit more than the dole

223
00:16:46,20 --> 00:16:47,46
and have the rest of the time free

224
00:16:47,46 --> 00:16:50,00
but because there was nothing
happening along those lines.

225
00:16:50,04 --> 00:16:54,26
I started a reforestation contracting
business by advertising through the local

226
00:16:54,26 --> 00:16:55,29
newspapers and found

227
00:16:55,29 --> 00:17:00,07
that there was a very substantial demand
from people who wanted trees planted on

228
00:17:00,07 --> 00:17:06,14
their land. So you know we
planted 85000 trees for.

229
00:17:06,15 --> 00:17:12,52
Say you know 100 different landowners
over the next five years and till

230
00:17:12,52 --> 00:17:15,37
that business was cleaned up in
the recession you ninety three.

231
00:17:15,70 --> 00:17:21,90
At which time i had a bad back chronic
tin ear and about $5000 worth of debts

232
00:17:21,90 --> 00:17:23,50
and went up to brisbane

233
00:17:23,50 --> 00:17:31,99
and worked in a bar for a couple of
years to get myself back on my feet.

234
00:17:33,32 --> 00:17:37,68
Building the house was quite an experience
because we did it in 1974 which was the

235
00:17:37,68 --> 00:17:42,33
year of you know the biggest flood
that we've had in in recent times

236
00:17:43,18 --> 00:17:48,19
and so it rained. Fairly solidly
for about five months but.

237
00:17:49,04 --> 00:17:49,54
It was a great experience.

238
00:17:49,90 --> 00:17:52,50
You know sort of picking up
building skills as you go along.

239
00:17:54,81 --> 00:17:55,74
Using the materials

240
00:17:55,74 --> 00:17:59,54
that came to hand like the whole house
cost of the order of a thousand dollars to

241
00:17:59,54 --> 00:18:02,38
get. You know the basic
house structure up so

242
00:18:02,38 --> 00:18:07,25
that for example the uprights in the house
were split out of dead trees on the

243
00:18:07,25 --> 00:18:07,52
property

244
00:18:07,52 --> 00:18:13,20
and then brought axton ads to you know
provide a sort of five by five for a few

245
00:18:13,20 --> 00:18:17,86
beam and you know lots of second
hand materials recycle materials

246
00:18:17,86 --> 00:18:20,88
and they turned out quite
a beautiful structure

247
00:18:20,88 --> 00:18:26,60
and well while we didn't have any of our
kids at home at it it's good for about i

248
00:18:26,60 --> 00:18:33,40
think 15 years and had
one child born in it.

249
00:18:33,42 --> 00:18:38,95
Lasted well and you know
gave a lot of people shelter

250
00:18:38,95 --> 00:18:42,45
and satisfaction at an event.

251
00:19:05,26 --> 00:19:09,05
I think nimbin was the focus for
all sorts of alternative ideas

252
00:19:09,05 --> 00:19:15,40
and a lot of those ideas have now been
co-opted into mainstream society you know

253
00:19:15,40 --> 00:19:19,87
the you know 15 20 years ago. If
you are brown rice and so on.

254
00:19:19,99 --> 00:19:21,58
You're some kind of fruitcake

255
00:19:21,58 --> 00:19:25,55
and now you could be the prime
minister a lot of the ideas

256
00:19:25,55 --> 00:19:27,27
that were looked on as
you know sort of wild

257
00:19:27,27 --> 00:19:30,78
and fanciful then as i said now mainstream

258
00:19:30,78 --> 00:19:35,36
and environmental concern certainly
in that category of ideas

259
00:19:35,36 --> 00:19:39,77
that were espoused strongly there
that are now the concern of everyone.

260
00:19:40,75 --> 00:19:41,05
So i think

261
00:19:41,05 --> 00:19:45,99
that as a focus for alternative ideas it
certainly played a substantial role in the

262
00:19:45,99 --> 00:19:48,60
environment movement.

263
00:19:48,61 --> 00:19:54,85
Also there's been a lot of major gains
in terms of forest issues made not

264
00:19:54,85 --> 00:19:59,75
necessarily by people at nimbin but
by people who are you know among.

265
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:01,86
The alternative lifestyle
community on the north coast

266
00:20:01,86 --> 00:20:07,02
and probably notably the
community at rainier creek.

267
00:20:08,34 --> 00:20:14,35
The cessation of rainforest logging in
new south wales was largely a result of

268
00:20:14,35 --> 00:20:14,84
that protest

269
00:20:14,84 --> 00:20:20,82
and the subsequent protest at mount nardi
against logging in the nightcap national

270
00:20:20,82 --> 00:20:23,51
what's now the nightcap
national park up there

271
00:20:24,30 --> 00:20:30,51
and i was actually arrested there on the
the day before the the decision was taken

272
00:20:30,51 --> 00:20:34,51
to stop rainforest logging in
new south wales or a decision

273
00:20:34,51 --> 00:20:38,51
that purported to stop rainforest logging
in new south wales was taken the day

274
00:20:38,51 --> 00:20:39,01
after that.

275
00:20:47,90 --> 00:20:51,33
Probably the one thing that needs to be
said is that they were a great party.

276
00:20:52,58 --> 00:20:56,23
You know i think everyone who came to the
protest while there was a lot of grief

277
00:20:56,23 --> 00:21:00,51
about what was happening in the forests
there was a lot of joy in coming together

278
00:21:00,51 --> 00:21:02,45
and working for a common cause.

279
00:21:02,76 --> 00:21:08,60
And certainly very positive experience i
think for everyone who are attended the

280
00:21:08,60 --> 00:21:10,90
protest including probably
some of the police and

281
00:21:12,09 --> 00:21:13,95
and maybe even some of the
loggers you know i think

282
00:21:13,95 --> 00:21:18,99
that perhaps even they weren't a bit
but yeah it was great things going on.

283
00:21:19,26 --> 00:21:24,71
You know sweat lodges and you
know campfires and lots of music

284
00:21:24,71 --> 00:21:26,86
and months of massages

285
00:21:26,86 --> 00:21:32,18
and you know there was a strong festival
element to all of the forest protests

286
00:21:32,18 --> 00:21:43,13
that i've seen.

287
00:21:43,15 --> 00:21:49,65
I think so. Certainly concern
about the environment is a theme

288
00:21:49,65 --> 00:21:55,27
that runs through all of alternative
ideas and you know the idea

289
00:21:55,27 --> 00:21:57,58
that we're basically part
of nature and need to.

290
00:22:00,72 --> 00:22:04,53
Moderated my to moderate our
demands on natural systems

291
00:22:04,53 --> 00:22:09,92
and live in harmony with nature is you
know one of the key concepts in the whole

292
00:22:09,92 --> 00:22:14,93
alternative movement that
answers your question.

293
00:22:14,95 --> 00:22:14,98
Oh

294
00:22:40,97 --> 00:22:45,44
yeah well there's a
reorientation of priorities

295
00:22:45,44 --> 00:22:48,97
that comes from moving from
the city to the country

296
00:22:48,97 --> 00:22:52,20
and the idea of becoming more
involved in the processes

297
00:22:52,20 --> 00:22:53,05
that make your life possible.

298
00:22:54,36 --> 00:22:58,89
I think you know involves a
fundamental shift in values.

299
00:22:59,95 --> 00:23:04,65
Having said that there i mean just
by coming to value natural processes

300
00:23:04,65 --> 00:23:10,04
and trying to become involved in natural
processes in a holistic way doesn't mean

301
00:23:10,04 --> 00:23:14,48
that you suddenly cut yourself off
from your past and people often expect

302
00:23:14,48 --> 00:23:18,26
that people are moved to the country
necessarily stop all the habits

303
00:23:18,26 --> 00:23:21,76
that they had when they were
living in the city and that

304
00:23:21,76 --> 00:23:23,03
that certainly isn't the case.

305
00:23:23,64 --> 00:23:26,79
So it's been a dialectic
you know between hope

306
00:23:26,79 --> 00:23:30,33
and despair i suppose you know
despair being the paradigm

307
00:23:30,33 --> 00:23:35,30
that it's dominant in you know
sort of poor urban lifestyle

308
00:23:37,55 --> 00:23:40,44
and it's a fair bit of despair in a
poor rural lifestyle i'd say too

309
00:23:40,44 --> 00:23:46,32
but at least once you know in intimate
contact with nature and the forces of life.

310
00:23:46,34 --> 00:23:51,68
So that i think i spent a
lot of time between then

311
00:23:51,68 --> 00:23:54,41
and now sort of poised
between hope and despair.

312
00:23:54,88 --> 00:23:57,29
I mean there's still a lot
of strong indications

313
00:23:57,29 --> 00:23:59,91
that the human race is
down the tubes in in.

314
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,23
Next a century

315
00:24:01,23 --> 00:24:05,16
or two you know in terms of quiet matic
disruption the greenhouse effect the ozone

316
00:24:05,16 --> 00:24:06,13
layer the place

317
00:24:06,13 --> 00:24:10,88
and all of those sorts of problems if they're
not addressed are obviously not very

318
00:24:10,88 --> 00:24:16,45
favorable to the survival of our
species. And i think that it's.

319
00:24:17,58 --> 00:24:18,36
Very important

320
00:24:18,36 --> 00:24:24,32
that alternatives to you know the current
consumer oriented lifestyles are put

321
00:24:24,32 --> 00:24:24,53
forward

322
00:24:24,53 --> 00:24:34,58
and i think you know that's part
of the real value of an inventive.

323
00:24:37,86 --> 00:24:42,51
Well i think you know there was a
reasonable component of i've had an ism.

324
00:24:43,92 --> 00:24:46,28
Although i mean how much of the activity

325
00:24:46,28 --> 00:24:49,40
that passes beheading is an
actually creates pleasure.

326
00:24:49,51 --> 00:24:53,28
You know in the short medium or
long term is probably questionable

327
00:24:55,55 --> 00:24:59,70
but you know i think a lot of what
some people would see as head in is

328
00:24:59,70 --> 00:25:01,32
and hurts a lot you know

329
00:25:03,02 --> 00:25:07,35
and a lot of what passes for hidden ism
is really about escaping from painful

330
00:25:07,35 --> 00:25:08,82
realities.

331
00:25:09,83 --> 00:25:13,15
And those realities if you try to escape
from the intended just become more painful

332
00:25:16,33 --> 00:25:22,08
and other major change in since
i want to show those windows

333
00:25:22,08 --> 00:25:27,18
that are going to be a problem with.

334
00:25:30,92 --> 00:25:34,55
A major change in number
that i've seen since 1973

335
00:25:36,23 --> 00:25:39,55
and actually occurred you know
fairly definite time about three

336
00:25:39,55 --> 00:25:43,91
or four years after the first of all was
the arrival of smack in then you know

337
00:25:44,68 --> 00:25:45,16
prior to

338
00:25:45,16 --> 00:25:49,77
that there was virtually no street crime
you leave your keys in the uk have no

339
00:25:49,77 --> 00:25:54,37
concerns about the security
of your home and so on and.

340
00:25:54,39 --> 00:25:57,88
You know as soon as hard
drugs arrived in the bin

341
00:25:57,88 --> 00:25:59,88
or you know visibly arrived in them.

342
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:01,42
When that all changed

343
00:26:01,42 --> 00:26:06,74
and you know on a certain level of places
been going downhill since then you know

344
00:26:06,74 --> 00:26:09,92
in terms of social amenity
and so on and i think

345
00:26:09,92 --> 00:26:13,77
that that's probably a faction of that
polarity between hope and despair.

346
00:26:14,23 --> 00:26:14,85
You know

347
00:26:14,85 --> 00:26:19,35
that there's a cause for great hope you
know given some of the alternative ideas

348
00:26:19,35 --> 00:26:22,02
that have come forward and there are
drops in by mainstream society.

349
00:26:22,47 --> 00:26:25,02
There's also considerable
grounds for despair

350
00:26:25,02 --> 00:26:29,34
and individuals you know caught between
those two poles can go either way

351
00:26:30,21 --> 00:26:30,53
and i think

352
00:26:30,53 --> 00:26:34,55
that women is a place where both extremes
are highly visible you know where you've

353
00:26:34,55 --> 00:26:38,51
got some of the most constructive alternatives
in terms of you know environmental

354
00:26:38,51 --> 00:26:40,51
work in terms of alternative technologies.

355
00:26:40,63 --> 00:26:44,36
You've also got substantial number of
people who live there who are basically

356
00:26:45,57 --> 00:26:47,86
concerned with wiping themselves out

357
00:26:48,56 --> 00:26:54,75
and nimbin seems to be a place of
extremes you know one of the things

358
00:26:54,75 --> 00:26:56,33
that i used to say about an indian is

359
00:26:56,33 --> 00:27:01,10
that it was a very tolerant place in fact
it was the town where even intolerance

360
00:27:01,10 --> 00:27:01,89
was tolerated

361
00:27:01,89 --> 00:27:08,82
and yeah it's certainly a
place a visible extremes.

362
00:27:09,13 --> 00:27:16,43
Of a number of different spectrums.

363
00:27:18,81 --> 00:27:21,07
There was a few reasons
why i left nimbin one was

364
00:27:21,07 --> 00:27:22,58
that i wanted to study at university

365
00:27:23,49 --> 00:27:27,29
and you know get more actual
skills in environmental management

366
00:27:28,18 --> 00:27:29,20
and so i was much more convenient.

367
00:27:29,60 --> 00:27:32,48
Given that the university was in
lismore to move into this more

368
00:27:33,20 --> 00:27:34,76
but also an immense
quite a small community

369
00:27:34,76 --> 00:27:38,72
and it can be quite difficult living in
a small community in terms of everyone

370
00:27:38,72 --> 00:27:40,57
knows what everyone else
is doing all the time

371
00:27:40,57 --> 00:27:47,37
and you know you need certain amount of
anonymity is always quite good to have in

372
00:27:47,37 --> 00:27:48,06
your life.

373
00:27:48,17 --> 00:27:54,10
So being part of a larger community is as
as i mean lose more as is another of the

374
00:27:54,10 --> 00:27:59,92
reasons why i left there.

375
00:28:02,48 --> 00:28:02,99
I think the main thing

376
00:28:02,99 --> 00:28:06,49
that puts strains on relationships
at an indian is the fact

377
00:28:06,49 --> 00:28:10,59
that there's very little work and
consequently very little income

378
00:28:10,59 --> 00:28:14,68
and so you know building a
house and raising children

379
00:28:15,60 --> 00:28:18,75
when you're on the dole is
basically extremely difficult

380
00:28:18,75 --> 00:28:24,36
and you know maintaining a relationship
in those extremely difficult economic

381
00:28:24,36 --> 00:28:29,27
circumstances is is not
an easy task. So that.

382
00:28:32,18 --> 00:28:35,22
While i was doing the tree planning
business i was probably earning less than i

383
00:28:35,22 --> 00:28:36,57
would have been getting on the dole.

384
00:28:38,03 --> 00:28:42,53
So yeah just that many years
of that level of poverty.

385
00:28:42,85 --> 00:28:45,45
I think that places great
strains on relationships

386
00:28:45,45 --> 00:28:53,71
and certainly did online.

387
00:29:00,56 --> 00:29:01,90
No favorite moments story.

388
00:29:03,77 --> 00:29:07,26
Couple of favorite no names cinna no

389
00:29:12,25 --> 00:29:16,10
time firmly in cheek i mean the places.

390
00:29:16,12 --> 00:29:20,71
Been extremely important in australian
society i do remember graeme dunstan saying

391
00:29:20,71 --> 00:29:26,00
to me once that in 1938 39 the place
a very young man of good will.

392
00:29:26,05 --> 00:29:31,85
Was inspired and on in 73 it was
in then i'd still tend to believe

393
00:29:31,85 --> 00:29:33,72
that there is truth in that.

394
00:29:33,98 --> 00:29:38,29
And that as a focus for alternative ideas

395
00:29:38,29 --> 00:29:50,80
that an immense played a very
important role in australian society.

396
00:30:00,97 --> 00:30:03,90
I think like the rest of australia.

397
00:30:03,92 --> 00:30:10,21
Nimbin has made significant gains in
terms of the natural environment through

398
00:30:10,21 --> 00:30:12,67
reestablishing tree cover and so on.

399
00:30:13,66 --> 00:30:18,59
But in terms of whether it's done
enough i'd say definitely no and that.

400
00:30:18,61 --> 00:30:22,12
You know the newman valley is probably
one of the best areas in australia for

401
00:30:22,12 --> 00:30:22,73
growing trees

402
00:30:22,73 --> 00:30:28,76
and while there's significant numbers
being planted i think we need to get made

403
00:30:28,76 --> 00:30:35,00
workforce and commercially driven tree
growing activities and. And we also need.

404
00:30:36,25 --> 00:30:39,62
An acceptance across a society that
the environmental cost of the vellum

405
00:30:39,62 --> 00:30:45,22
and always need to be balanced by environmental
benefits to counterbalance those

406
00:30:45,22 --> 00:30:48,51
costs.

407
00:30:53,05 --> 00:30:57,10
I think it's not just a challenge for new
minutes the challenge for us to alia to

408
00:30:57,10 --> 00:30:59,74
realise that we are the get sustainable

409
00:30:59,74 --> 00:31:05,07
or we're on the way out.

410
00:31:05,08 --> 00:31:08,96
Limit is always been a magnet for fruitcakes
of various kinds you know other people

411
00:31:08,96 --> 00:31:13,19
who. You know because their
ideas were too progressive

412
00:31:13,19 --> 00:31:18,22
or too good for mainstream society of
needed to go the people whose ideas

413
00:31:18,23 --> 00:31:21,64
and behaviour were unacceptable to the
rest of society have tended to go there.

414
00:31:21,79 --> 00:31:27,79
So you know there's been some. Fantastic
ideas that have been born there.

415
00:31:28,88 --> 00:31:31,15
There's been some wondering incredibles
that you wouldn't believe.

416
00:31:34,21 --> 00:31:41,75
Pleasure.
