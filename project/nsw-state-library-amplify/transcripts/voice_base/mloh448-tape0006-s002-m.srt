1
00:00:05,16 --> 00:00:54,88
One day to day life. This kind. Very big street has moved up to great great.

2
00:01:07,17 --> 00:03:04,18
What are you really like you know what are the right places like. You must be doing very well.

3
00:03:23,49 --> 00:05:12,33
DOING THE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT. That will never be one that was probably the case.

4
00:05:16,98 --> 00:05:57,45
Yet I see there for a not that you should join US market for your.

5
00:06:11,65 --> 00:08:00,94
What the Russians do to this day cancel what you know we did you not that I did not. Yes it was.

6
00:08:05,37 --> 00:08:21,05
If there's a safe place you send their kids.

7
00:08:24,3 --> 00:08:48,26
That said you're going to do this we can use them leave and then you saw a little bit out there that that's the way.

8
00:08:50,26 --> 00:08:52,12
Right right here right.

9
00:08:52,47 --> 00:09:44,52
Why did that throw a baby right there just like that

10
00:09:45,66 --> 00:09:58,3
or the neighborhood spend a fortune that you paid for you right away you were out where yeah yeah.

11
00:09:58,3 --> 00:11:09,5
Where you and I would. Right. So it's probably just a story with a great story.

12
00:11:10,68 --> 00:11:53,91
Just get right when you look at the individuals just about religion if you don't really get what they say oh wait.

13
00:12:02,7 --> 00:12:40,33
Through banks where a radical thought that if you can get it right.

14
00:12:47,83 --> 00:12:59,66
That man is in there trying to work Saturday morning.

15
00:13:01,81 --> 00:13:13,56
But you know that guy is already here and I thought before you know before.

16
00:13:13,7 --> 00:13:28,16
Both of you get caught up are you going to blow your stack size trying to get very high stop me from drag stuff.

17
00:13:29,24 --> 00:13:44,93
This way so seriously. We just used to do was get a check.

18
00:13:47,97 --> 00:13:58,85
Because it was quick to raise that was we thought it would do yes.

19
00:14:03,81 --> 00:14:27,83
Then I remember right here I'll be all right this time. Oh God hears her cry cry she she's going to stop me.

20
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:48,84
Yeah you know. All right on that one very good. It was a Science Show a monster and she's with us.

21
00:14:50,53 --> 00:15:06,84
How do you know if you're right Johnny she said I think it's this Christ the way the Salvation Army.

22
00:15:06,93 --> 00:15:26,73
How do you know the Straits intellect. Oh he's right here.

23
00:15:26,77 --> 00:15:54,27
There's a risk if we go through with it seems pretty easy no people just see the year of easy so he did have.

24
00:16:35,11 --> 00:19:15,97
Yeah yeah you. You know the real me was that the right. Everybody thought oh no they're all right. Child.

25
00:19:16,02 --> 00:19:32,57
This is not the first man no real bright guy. Yes. Yeah. And what's not.

26
00:19:32,81 --> 00:19:37,47
Why don't I just get up and they fight about that ancestor they say you know what.

27
00:19:39,57 --> 00:19:51,08
I mean that they need some system through the last year where he carried sign language with you know just fine.

28
00:19:51,18 --> 00:20:00,86
Yeah yeah. Mr Dering missed the whole miss in the West Bank but it was something right there right.

29
00:20:25,08 --> 00:20:57,11
They enter a second base pretty good there. That's not really directly there right now where not used to.

30
00:20:58,26 --> 00:21:02,53
Well I used to say

31
00:21:03,67 --> 00:21:20,57
when the he was in so many different states we used to go where my mate where there used again War lasers

32
00:21:24,21 --> 00:21:43,24
and I was just really brought out of the hole or he saw the whole thing My Space will be what he had always worried

33
00:21:45,31 --> 00:22:23,42
and when little guys when you're really not rusty got very busy. Drain nature mean nothing to trade with.

34
00:22:26,92 --> 00:22:41,19
Well we probably get there then try the old boy she saw that we are working.

35
00:22:43,16 --> 00:23:02,8
And they were nice guys not that hard and instead they have a year and then what used to have a place we share right.

36
00:23:04,2 --> 00:23:21,93
And I used to get pissed off to say if we had pineapple you know the next time some crazy was cured of.

37
00:23:27,97 --> 00:23:47,9
That maybe it will be something. You just know you might do.

38
00:23:48,91 --> 00:24:03,83
That is just before the six o'clock was before where the thing. Not even got a five zero or that. Or the. All Russians.

41
00:24:19,7 --> 00:24:38,55

42
00:24:38,55 --> 00:24:44,47
love with the world and that's what I mean in my life.

43
00:24:44,5 --> 00:24:57,83
