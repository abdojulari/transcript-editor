1
00:00:11,31 --> 00:00:14,69
Yes. Probably i going on we go.

2
00:00:16,46 --> 00:00:21,35
One great concern i have 20 years
after the nimbin experiment started.

3
00:00:21,85 --> 00:00:27,96
Is that the ideas and ethics of
the. The nimbin inverted commas.

4
00:00:28,70 --> 00:00:35,63
Workforce. Are certainly the best we have
i think we need. I think we've got lost.

5
00:00:38,01 --> 00:00:41,17
It's it's now 20 years since
the nimbin experiment began.

6
00:00:41,49 --> 00:00:44,24
And i feel more than ever
that the ideas and ethics of

7
00:00:44,24 --> 00:00:49,75
that era were exceptionally fine and we
don't have to apologize for these things

8
00:00:50,46 --> 00:00:52,09
but what concerns me enormously is

9
00:00:52,09 --> 00:00:56,93
that often the energy levels don't match
the ideas and as opposed to this.

10
00:00:57,01 --> 00:01:00,46
We have normal society where
often there's tremendous energy

11
00:01:01,19 --> 00:01:05,77
but it's usually destructive energy and
somehow we have to marry the ideas

12
00:01:05,77 --> 00:01:12,17
and aspirations and wonderful philosophies
of the new age with the energy

13
00:01:12,17 --> 00:01:15,86
and ability and strength of the the old
age. If that's what you like to call it.

14
00:01:16,59 --> 00:01:19,07
I don't know how we do that because
at the moment the the energies

15
00:01:19,07 --> 00:01:22,72
and strengths of conventional
society are destroying the planet

16
00:01:22,72 --> 00:01:25,14
and we have to turn this around somehow.

17
00:01:25,16 --> 00:01:28,65
But sometimes when you see the
lack of motivation amongst.

18
00:01:28,67 --> 00:01:33,06
Local greens and the idea that somehow
the law just work out by itself.

19
00:01:33,38 --> 00:01:34,74
I despair a bit.

20
00:01:35,44 --> 00:01:38,43
But in the long term i think somehow
those ideas will come through

21
00:01:38,43 --> 00:01:45,10
and we will manage to meet them
with the activity levels as well.

22
00:01:45,93 --> 00:01:47,69
We have to be in it for the long
haul. We don't have a choice.

23
00:01:48,03 --> 00:01:51,81
We all have to work as well as
we can and the main way to do

24
00:01:51,81 --> 00:01:53,98
that at the moment is to
keep positivity levels up.

25
00:01:54,11 --> 00:01:58,94
I think this is where the the american comic
friend pete is got an enormous amount

26
00:01:58,94 --> 00:01:59,40
to teach us.

27
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,05
Because she is seems to have dedicated her
life lately to recognizing the despair

28
00:02:04,05 --> 00:02:08,56
levels. In not only greens but a
lot of other people on the planet

29
00:02:09,33 --> 00:02:11,21
and she makes quite obvious.

30
00:02:11,24 --> 00:02:11,47
The fact

31
00:02:11,47 --> 00:02:14,32
that you're not going to be effective in
anything you fight for unless you stay

32
00:02:14,32 --> 00:02:15,96
positive and often that means laughing.

33
00:02:16,13 --> 00:02:20,12
So her mission is in fact
to make people laugh about.

34
00:02:21,32 --> 00:02:24,97
Subjects that i guess you would call.
Gallows humor. They're really.

35
00:02:25,51 --> 00:02:30,20
Terrible prospects death of planet
nuclear war pollution on the grand scale

36
00:02:30,20 --> 00:02:33,06
but she can make us laugh
about it and in that way.

37
00:02:33,11 --> 00:02:35,97
Empower us completely and so some of the.

38
00:02:36,56 --> 00:02:37,10
The mantras

39
00:02:37,10 --> 00:02:41,49
that she's used in her talks i just
find it tremendously powerful for me.

40
00:02:42,44 --> 00:02:44,45
One of them is this is a mantra

41
00:02:44,45 --> 00:02:48,11
that you say after you've been pretty
depressed about a particular issue

42
00:02:48,11 --> 00:02:54,07
and it goes. Oh what a disappointment
and another another mantra of hers

43
00:02:54,07 --> 00:02:57,26
or a slogan is.

44
00:02:57,27 --> 00:03:01,83
The people united will sometimes
win and sometimes lose.

45
00:03:01,85 --> 00:03:02,53
And

46
00:03:02,53 --> 00:03:05,59
when she says there's been a big auditorium
it brings the house down because we've

47
00:03:05,59 --> 00:03:08,08
all been there. We've all for the
issues and lost them and feel

48
00:03:08,08 --> 00:03:11,67
that was the end of the world but she's
teaching us to pick ourselves up

49
00:03:11,67 --> 00:03:13,20
and keep going. It's ok to lose.

50
00:03:14,36 --> 00:03:15,30
It might be the end of the world

51
00:03:16,08 --> 00:03:28,07
but it's not the end
of you for the moment.

52
00:03:28,09 --> 00:03:28,57
When you.

53
00:03:29,94 --> 00:03:34,03
Yes i do think there is quite a significant
burnout level amongst a lot of the old

54
00:03:34,03 --> 00:03:35,38
aquariums. But against

55
00:03:35,38 --> 00:03:39,46
that we have an extremely hopeful sign of
a whole new breed of people have in fact

56
00:03:39,46 --> 00:03:42,09
made an industry out of
keeping people positive

57
00:03:42,09 --> 00:03:47,26
and these people are extremely skilled
and specialized in their outlook

58
00:03:47,97 --> 00:03:49,87
and these people are going to be the ones

59
00:03:49,87 --> 00:03:52,51
that really matter in the end
because they can get us going again

60
00:03:53,67 --> 00:03:56,34
and i think it's fair enough to take a
lot of knock backs the planet is in bad

61
00:03:56,34 --> 00:04:00,11
shape. So it's it's ok to
be depressed about. At it.

62
00:04:00,13 --> 00:04:03,55
We just have to make sure we have a few
little skills to get us back on track.

63
00:04:03,72 --> 00:04:05,02
So we can keep fighting and feel

64
00:04:05,02 --> 00:04:07,93
that there is some reason to keep going
because basically we don't have a choice.

65
00:04:08,98 --> 00:04:13,29
We can't back out where in here we're
stuck and the only thing is to keep going

66
00:04:13,29 --> 00:04:15,02
and the only way to keep
going. Is to stay positive.

67
00:04:15,40 --> 00:04:17,15
So it's a bit of a circle

68
00:04:17,15 --> 00:04:20,20
but if you look at the right way
you can feel it's all worthwhile.

69
00:04:20,59 --> 00:04:23,38
When you look at the beauty of the
place how can you not fight for it.

70
00:04:23,43 --> 00:04:26,07
I always wonder why do people
feel that it's hopeless.

71
00:04:26,50 --> 00:04:30,53
It's obvious that you have to
keep going. And thank you.

72
00:04:32,72 --> 00:04:41,28
And to take.

73
00:04:43,50 --> 00:04:48,73
Young hugh nicholson i came to the
area to throw me a creek in 1974

74
00:04:50,21 --> 00:04:55,86
after. I was a teacher in melbourne
and gradually became more

75
00:04:55,86 --> 00:04:58,90
and more aware of problems of pollution
and environmental degradation

76
00:04:58,90 --> 00:04:59,93
or actual stuff

77
00:04:59,93 --> 00:05:05,69
and although i was getting through to kids
with my teaching i just felt as though

78
00:05:05,69 --> 00:05:10,66
what i really wanted to do was to
try and live a simpler lifestyle

79
00:05:10,66 --> 00:05:12,96
and see where it was possible rather
than just trying to tell people

80
00:05:12,96 --> 00:05:14,26
that it would you could do it.

81
00:05:14,31 --> 00:05:19,32
And so with nan and i set
off looking for land

82
00:05:19,32 --> 00:05:21,91
and after a year of searching
we found a place here.

83
00:05:22,52 --> 00:05:26,89
And tried to virtually drop out.

84
00:05:26,91 --> 00:05:31,58
I guess you'd say supposedly living a
subsistence lifestyle and very simply.

85
00:05:31,69 --> 00:05:36,86
But in fact it's extraordinarily difficult
to do anything with not only difficult

86
00:05:36,86 --> 00:05:41,31
but living a subsistence life
style is incredibly boring.

87
00:05:41,33 --> 00:05:44,82
Because you've got to work
your vegie garden every day

88
00:05:44,82 --> 00:05:47,97
and you've got to make sure that the
birds don't pinch your fruit and

89
00:05:47,97 --> 00:05:53,44
and then there are some things that you
can't produce readily like rice or wheat

90
00:05:53,44 --> 00:05:53,91
or whatever

91
00:05:53,91 --> 00:05:58,38
and you do need some money to buy so you
end up getting caught up in that cycle

92
00:05:58,39 --> 00:05:59,50
and that system anyway.

93
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:05,04
But we still have a lot of those philosophies
of producing what tucker we can from

94
00:06:05,04 --> 00:06:05,74
our own place

95
00:06:05,74 --> 00:06:11,46
and still living a simpler
lifestyle than most people

96
00:06:12,19 --> 00:06:13,46
but.

97
00:06:13,48 --> 00:06:20,09
We're not bent on pure
self-sufficiency anymore.

98
00:06:21,89 --> 00:06:25,55
It was an end at the time we came
it was what we intended to do

99
00:06:26,26 --> 00:06:30,91
but within a couple of weeks of
arriving at the rainier creek.

100
00:06:30,93 --> 00:06:35,70
We heard of forest commission
plans to log to rainier creek and

101
00:06:35,70 --> 00:06:38,42
when we followed up that
inquiry we found out

102
00:06:38,42 --> 00:06:43,10
that the plans were to log
all the miliband timber

103
00:06:43,92 --> 00:06:46,20
and then to clear fell arrest and burn it

104
00:06:46,20 --> 00:06:49,81
and plant with jiffy pop eucalypts

105
00:06:50,95 --> 00:06:53,03
and only two species because
they are the only trees

106
00:06:53,03 --> 00:06:56,75
that will grow faster than
lantana and so the intention

107
00:06:56,75 --> 00:06:59,85
and what they were doing in the
rest of the local state forest at

108
00:06:59,85 --> 00:07:05,32
that time was now clearing about 500
acres a year and replanting it.

109
00:07:05,52 --> 00:07:12,19
Do you call it. Flooded gum and black
but and since we look out on to.

110
00:07:12,80 --> 00:07:15,76
Tharani creek and the walls
of rainforest and so on here.

111
00:07:15,83 --> 00:07:17,00
The concept of having

112
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:23,35
that converted from rainforest to eucalypt
plantation full of lantana was just

113
00:07:25,35 --> 00:07:26,30
absolutely beyond comprehension.

114
00:07:26,76 --> 00:07:33,85
So that's why we started
fighting complaining.

115
00:07:36,46 --> 00:07:41,60
I've just happened to be here one day
under here a vehicle up in the forest

116
00:07:41,60 --> 00:07:45,37
and we were at the end of a of a
one way road as far as i was aware

117
00:07:45,37 --> 00:07:47,67
that there was no road beyond us.

118
00:07:47,88 --> 00:07:51,19
And when i walked into
forest to explore and try

119
00:07:51,19 --> 00:07:52,84
and track down the sound i found

120
00:07:52,84 --> 00:07:56,00
that there was an old forest road
coming down the side of the hill

121
00:07:56,76 --> 00:07:59,27
and there was a forestry road again.

122
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,74
Working there cleaning
up the water tables and.

123
00:08:03,76 --> 00:08:06,90
I asked whether they had
any intentions of using

124
00:08:06,90 --> 00:08:08,84
that road for access to tharani creek

125
00:08:08,84 --> 00:08:14,00
and were they planning to logon in their
innocence the the fellows on the work gang

126
00:08:14,00 --> 00:08:14,45
said yes

127
00:08:14,45 --> 00:08:17,75
and i think they've learned a lot since
then they don't tend to be so open with

128
00:08:17,75 --> 00:08:20,71
their answers anymore and.

129
00:08:20,73 --> 00:08:22,58
So having got a yes from then

130
00:08:22,58 --> 00:08:25,34
that they would be in some time we
immediately contacted the office

131
00:08:25,34 --> 00:08:31,39
and melinda which is a local forestry
office and asked what were the intentions

132
00:08:31,39 --> 00:08:37,94
and again because they hadn't confronted
a situation like this before with people

133
00:08:37,94 --> 00:08:41,48
opposing what they were doing
they were open with their answers

134
00:08:41,48 --> 00:08:47,78
and said yes they were intending to clear
fell it burned. And converted to euclid.

135
00:08:47,80 --> 00:08:53,19
And so it went on from there.

136
00:08:54,81 --> 00:08:56,69
You.

137
00:08:57,87 --> 00:09:04,84
Was about five years of ongoing
letters to politicians trying to

138
00:09:04,84 --> 00:09:09,38
develop a public awareness so we were
conducting walks up into the forest with

139
00:09:09,38 --> 00:09:14,45
anybody who wanted to go and and
part of the problem with that was

140
00:09:14,45 --> 00:09:19,00
that some of the forests had been logged
in the past and so it was unlocked

141
00:09:19,00 --> 00:09:23,74
but it was about a two hour walk because
the old logging road was buried in lantana

142
00:09:23,74 --> 00:09:24,54
and i saw stuff

143
00:09:24,54 --> 00:09:28,91
and it made slow walking so about time we
got somebody two hours into the forest

144
00:09:28,91 --> 00:09:31,61
they were ready to turn around to come
out again because they were mostly city

145
00:09:31,61 --> 00:09:35,65
people and their impression
was i don't mean logs

146
00:09:35,65 --> 00:09:40,12
and they didn't actually get to see this
other major portion of it which hadn't

147
00:09:40,12 --> 00:09:41,85
been logged in the past and
was absolutely spectacular

148
00:09:42,87 --> 00:09:48,29
and so we were we were up against
that as a problem. Quite often. That.

149
00:09:49,54 --> 00:09:53,88
People didn't have the stamina to
actually see undisturbed forest

150
00:09:53,88 --> 00:09:58,89
and didn't have the knowledge
to appreciate the effects

151
00:09:58,90 --> 00:09:59,93
that logging it had on the other.

152
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,30
Well as they're walking through.

153
00:10:07,16 --> 00:10:12,49
The absolute highlight of the blockade
for me was the organization of the camp.

154
00:10:12,50 --> 00:10:17,76
I was just so impressed by the ability of.

155
00:10:17,78 --> 00:10:23,96
What i so-called derogatorily called
hippies to coordinate so well.

156
00:10:25,55 --> 00:10:30,39
The camp within the first but the
first the end of the first day

157
00:10:31,29 --> 00:10:36,08
or second day we had water on to the
camp and from then on for the four weeks

158
00:10:36,08 --> 00:10:38,22
or whatever it was of the camp.

159
00:10:38,76 --> 00:10:43,39
There was hot running water for
showers at any time day or night.

160
00:10:43,41 --> 00:10:45,67
There were incredible meals cooked.

161
00:10:45,99 --> 00:10:51,16
We had donations of food from in lismore
shopkeepers would donate stuff and

162
00:10:51,16 --> 00:10:54,64
and people would go out and buy supplies

163
00:10:54,64 --> 00:10:56,51
and bring them in donate them to the camp

164
00:10:56,51 --> 00:11:01,18
and there were there was one group of
people who just decided to be the cooks

165
00:11:01,18 --> 00:11:05,69
and they put on three course meals
every day we just brilliant.

166
00:11:07,66 --> 00:11:11,26
They were better in fact than a lot better
than we were eating back at our house

167
00:11:11,26 --> 00:11:16,76
because we were so involved in
phone calls and media stuff

168
00:11:17,70 --> 00:11:21,77
that there was often not time to prepare
meals it was a really scratch meals where

169
00:11:21,77 --> 00:11:24,66
it up there were dead people dedicated
to just getting a meal together

170
00:11:25,58 --> 00:11:26,59
and then there were firewood.

171
00:11:26,83 --> 00:11:31,80
Gatherers and and so on and so
that was in the camp itself.

172
00:11:31,82 --> 00:11:36,69
And back here at the house we
had people with media skills.

173
00:11:36,87 --> 00:11:41,37
We had one who every day would pull a
final part and connect is wise into it

174
00:11:41,37 --> 00:11:44,32
and send his press releases off
directly through the phone

175
00:11:44,32 --> 00:11:48,56
and there was a duplicating
machine appeared.

176
00:11:48,62 --> 00:11:51,51
God knows where from but it appeared
and it was in the garage just

177
00:11:51,51 --> 00:11:55,79
and every night it was
duplicating off press release

178
00:11:55,79 --> 00:11:59,39
and so on for handouts to the media when
they turned up the next day so it was.

179
00:12:00,92 --> 00:12:04,86
Just. Incredibly well organised
and it all just happened.

180
00:12:04,91 --> 00:12:07,55
Together and i found that fascinating

181
00:12:07,55 --> 00:12:11,52
and interesting the after four weeks
of occupation of the campsite.

182
00:12:12,28 --> 00:12:14,60
There was no rubbish
there were the only sign

183
00:12:14,60 --> 00:12:17,23
that people had been there was
the grass was a bit flattened

184
00:12:17,23 --> 00:12:20,57
and a couple of people had levelled
sloping ground to put a tent

185
00:12:20,57 --> 00:12:25,87
that was there was. All the rubbish had
been buried and all so stuff and yet.

186
00:12:26,57 --> 00:12:28,38
Within a week of the
camp being dismantled.

187
00:12:28,82 --> 00:12:34,45
There were opposing groups who were coming

188
00:12:34,45 --> 00:12:38,54
and having rallies in the area
trying to promote their angle

189
00:12:38,54 --> 00:12:42,79
and invariably we had to spend a day after
each one of these cleaning up their

190
00:12:42,79 --> 00:12:46,00
rubbish in their garbage after which
it was really dramatic contrast

191
00:12:46,00 --> 00:13:01,22
and comparison.

192
00:13:03,04 --> 00:13:07,06
Well. It wasn't a pure victory
i guess it was a victory in

193
00:13:07,06 --> 00:13:08,89
that the logging was stopped.

194
00:13:09,77 --> 00:13:14,82
And it's interesting to talk about the
politics of the actual stopping of the

195
00:13:14,82 --> 00:13:21,46
logging because at one stage the loggers
were intent on filling as many trees as

196
00:13:21,46 --> 00:13:24,59
possible. And so they were just coming in

197
00:13:24,59 --> 00:13:27,46
and dropping trees as fast
they could almost on the run.

198
00:13:27,48 --> 00:13:28,29
They'd fell a tree

199
00:13:28,29 --> 00:13:32,72
and some of these trees were radiocarbon
dated at in excess of a thousand years

200
00:13:32,72 --> 00:13:38,27
and they were really impressive trees
and the figures that we got were

201
00:13:38,27 --> 00:13:40,05
that there were about 600 trees

202
00:13:40,05 --> 00:13:43,67
that was all into running a creek
it was a very minor issue really

203
00:13:44,42 --> 00:13:46,47
and they found out

204
00:13:46,47 --> 00:13:50,91
that if they logged as fast as they could
then they could get 20 trees a day on the

205
00:13:50,91 --> 00:13:51,87
ground and often

206
00:13:51,87 --> 00:13:55,78
that meant falling trees across each other
which in some cases split the trunk so

207
00:13:55,78 --> 00:13:59,81
it was incredibly wasteful but they
were just really going for it anyway.

208
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:00,92
One friday afternoon

209
00:14:00,92 --> 00:14:04,02
that they had spent a day of doing this
just felling trees as fast as possible.

210
00:14:05,18 --> 00:14:08,34
And then they knocked off and went home
for the weekend and over the weekend.

211
00:14:08,36 --> 00:14:11,68
Somebody and we still don't
know who but somebody went up

212
00:14:11,68 --> 00:14:16,06
and actually cut up the fallen trees into
two meter lengths they just sawed through

213
00:14:16,06 --> 00:14:17,38
them with a chainsaw

214
00:14:18,31 --> 00:14:23,36
and there was a lot of
adverse media from that

215
00:14:23,36 --> 00:14:28,52
and the storming lobby obviously picked
up on it as being the most horrendously

216
00:14:28,52 --> 00:14:30,29
vandal east thing to have done.

217
00:14:31,42 --> 00:14:34,16
But what it meant was that
when they came back next week.

218
00:14:34,22 --> 00:14:37,94
They only filled three trees a day.

219
00:14:37,95 --> 00:14:39,14
Because the trees were so big

220
00:14:39,14 --> 00:14:41,96
that they can only fit part
of a tree on a logging junker

221
00:14:41,96 --> 00:14:44,49
and they could only take
nine trucks out a day

222
00:14:45,56 --> 00:14:48,29
and so it's slowed the whole operation
down they worked on for another week

223
00:14:48,29 --> 00:14:50,77
and they cut another 20 trees.

224
00:14:50,98 --> 00:14:55,14
But if they hadn't been
stymied by the felling

225
00:14:55,14 --> 00:14:58,84
and by the cutting up of the fallen logs
they would have had the job half done in

226
00:14:58,84 --> 00:15:03,47
that week. So it's been it
was interesting how how

227
00:15:03,47 --> 00:15:08,49
that action which got a lot of bad
press was in fact what say the forest

228
00:15:08,49 --> 00:15:11,06
and now of course everybody
who are to run a creek.

229
00:15:11,09 --> 00:15:12,50
What a benchmark decision you know

230
00:15:12,50 --> 00:15:16,78
that was the forerunner of of this world
heritage rainforest which we're all so

231
00:15:16,78 --> 00:15:17,25
proud of.

232
00:15:18,48 --> 00:15:27,83
But it comes from what
we've seen as being it.

233
00:15:27,85 --> 00:15:29,39
And yes.

234
00:15:29,41 --> 00:15:34,93
Ran as a politician was on the side
but he had a very divided cabinet

235
00:15:34,93 --> 00:15:36,90
and so it was a fine balancing act

236
00:15:36,90 --> 00:15:42,80
and he got caught up in in trying to spin
the thing out long enough to get enough

237
00:15:42,80 --> 00:15:47,77
people in cabinet to come on
the side and so in the way

238
00:15:47,77 --> 00:15:52,42
that the logging was not yes we
won but we didn't have an inquiry

239
00:15:52,42 --> 00:15:59,29
and i would never ever recommend anybody
again asking for an inquiry as being

240
00:15:59,29 --> 00:16:05,89
the way out. I'm an issue because we got
involved in an exhausting. Inquiry that.

241
00:16:05,91 --> 00:16:10,33
Went on for for two years i think and.

242
00:16:11,40 --> 00:16:14,72
The forestry people had all their experts
in the sawmill it had their paid it

243
00:16:14,72 --> 00:16:19,97
spurts and we were expected to be there
to put our case if we weren't there

244
00:16:19,97 --> 00:16:22,40
when we were unable to refute
the stuff that they said

245
00:16:22,40 --> 00:16:25,93
but obviously all of it
came out of our pockets and

246
00:16:26,77 --> 00:16:30,48
that win against us too because
the judge said we were in there.

247
00:16:30,55 --> 00:16:31,69
Not for financial gain.

248
00:16:32,07 --> 00:16:33,82
But because we're emotionally involved

249
00:16:34,80 --> 00:16:38,10
and if we're in vocally involved in
obviously our evidence was suspect.

250
00:16:38,50 --> 00:16:42,50
Whereas these guys working for forestry
commission who are being paid to do their

251
00:16:42,50 --> 00:16:44,62
job and if they didn't say the
right things would lose their job

252
00:16:44,62 --> 00:16:47,99
that was ok obviously everything
they said was perfectly true

253
00:16:47,99 --> 00:16:49,89
and correct was a very difficult inquiry.

254
00:16:50,02 --> 00:16:56,09
It was hard during that inquiry
to stay enthusiastic. One.

255
00:16:56,12 --> 00:16:58,29
I'll tell you a classic.

256
00:16:58,31 --> 00:17:01,80
One of our people was giving evidence
on the wildlife use of the forest

257
00:17:01,80 --> 00:17:05,76
and the need for old growth
trees with hollow branches

258
00:17:06,57 --> 00:17:10,41
and he'd gone into quite a long explanation
of the types of animals the possums

259
00:17:10,41 --> 00:17:14,87
and the gliders and the owls
and all the stuff that uses.

260
00:17:14,89 --> 00:17:17,56
Hollow branches in the fact
that a number of these are rare

261
00:17:17,56 --> 00:17:20,02
and endangered animals and
they occur into rainier creek

262
00:17:20,83 --> 00:17:26,67
and after pages of evidence on this.
The judge finally turned to men said.

263
00:17:27,43 --> 00:17:28,78
I can't see the relevance
of this information.

264
00:17:30,10 --> 00:17:33,43
The loggers don't take the hollow
branches. They are left in the forest.

265
00:17:33,90 --> 00:17:37,09
What's the problem. So
the judge could not see

266
00:17:37,09 --> 00:17:41,75
that hollow branches 100 feet
in the ground used by animals

267
00:17:41,76 --> 00:17:43,24
that use the canopy of the forest.

268
00:17:43,39 --> 00:17:44,49
He believe

269
00:17:44,49 --> 00:17:48,34
that the same branches lying on the forest
floor would be just as useful to the

270
00:17:48,34 --> 00:17:52,60
owls and possums so his view was
that just taking out the stems

271
00:17:52,60 --> 00:17:59,17
and leaving the branches was quite ok so
his his understanding of ecological points

272
00:17:59,17 --> 00:18:05,45
was. Non-existent. He was horrified of
the forest he couldn't stand it and.

273
00:18:05,87 --> 00:18:12,82
At one stage we took all the rest of
the inquiry down to a particular pool

274
00:18:12,83 --> 00:18:18,38
in the creek where locals had used it
for picnics for 50 years they've been

275
00:18:18,38 --> 00:18:21,35
visiting this place and he couldn't
get there because he was so old

276
00:18:21,35 --> 00:18:24,61
and decrepit that he couldn't
get off the track and so we.

277
00:18:25,18 --> 00:18:29,97
When we got back up to the cars and
he was asking what we have seen.

278
00:18:30,74 --> 00:18:33,97
And we told him the people reporting
back to him told him what they'd seen

279
00:18:33,97 --> 00:18:40,61
and his response that was were there
any picnic tables chairs barbecues.

280
00:18:41,42 --> 00:18:44,75
The answer was no so he disbelieved all
evidence that anybody might have use

281
00:18:44,75 --> 00:18:47,48
that place for picking it was ridiculous
to assume that people use it.

282
00:18:47,56 --> 00:18:51,61
There weren't barbecues and picnic
tables and it was a lie to suggest

283
00:18:51,61 --> 00:18:52,58
that people use our place.

284
00:18:52,62 --> 00:18:55,28
He couldn't comprehend people
going to the forest for enjoyment

285
00:18:56,16 --> 00:18:56,92
and being prepared to walk.

286
00:18:58,20 --> 00:19:10,72
It was an uphill battle actually.

287
00:19:11,55 --> 00:19:12,83
I think unfortunately i think

288
00:19:12,83 --> 00:19:18,63
that there are still a lot of people who
are city based who would still see feel

289
00:19:18,63 --> 00:19:20,75
the same way. And

290
00:19:20,75 --> 00:19:27,18
that is the battle now for the green
movement is to get through to the people who

291
00:19:27,18 --> 00:19:29,66
don't relate to the natural environment.

292
00:19:30,98 --> 00:19:34,79
That no matter what they think the
natural environment relates to them.

293
00:19:35,60 --> 00:19:38,42
And that they're tied up with it
and that they can't escape it.

294
00:19:39,36 --> 00:19:41,46
And i think for people who live
all their life in the city.

295
00:19:41,57 --> 00:19:45,81
It is possible to believe that.

296
00:19:45,83 --> 00:19:51,61
The problems that are talked about
don't exist. And if in fact you.

297
00:19:51,63 --> 00:19:55,42
Live in a house get in a car
park in a covered car park

298
00:19:55,42 --> 00:19:59,95
and go to work in an office come home.
You don't need to know what move.

299
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,98
There's doing you don't need to
know whether it's clouding raining.

300
00:20:03,19 --> 00:20:05,50
Unless there's a bit of an
inconvenience of the weekends.

301
00:20:05,50 --> 00:20:08,25
You don't need to relate
to the environment.

302
00:20:08,26 --> 00:20:12,21
And that that is the problem you're getting
kids who are growing up in the sea.

303
00:20:12,23 --> 00:20:17,97
You know don't see trees you don't
run on grass and so it's people like

304
00:20:17,97 --> 00:20:23,13
that who find it really hard to
relate to the environment and to see

305
00:20:24,14 --> 00:20:28,52
that problems of pollution will
eventually have an effect on them.

306
00:20:30,47 --> 00:20:32,17
The rubbish that they produce.

307
00:20:33,51 --> 00:20:34,80
Has to go into a landfill somewhere

308
00:20:34,80 --> 00:20:39,12
and landfill sites are running out what do
we do with the rubbish do we in fact do

309
00:20:39,12 --> 00:20:40,13
what they do in america

310
00:20:40,13 --> 00:20:42,36
and take it out to see them barge in
just open the bottom and dump it.

311
00:20:44,74 --> 00:20:46,36
There's a limit to how
many times you can do

312
00:20:46,36 --> 00:20:51,77
that.

313
00:20:51,79 --> 00:20:57,88
You're welcome. On tape. I do.
It's the 6th of december 99.

314
00:20:58,38 --> 00:21:04,75
And we're speaking with david stein.

315
00:21:06,06 --> 00:21:11,82
S p a i n as in portugal.
And introduce yourself and.

316
00:21:12,91 --> 00:21:14,39
Yes but my name's david spain.

317
00:21:15,05 --> 00:21:20,98
I'm age 45 now i came to town
to ball falls in early 1975

318
00:21:23,52 --> 00:21:25,62
at that time.

319
00:21:25,64 --> 00:21:29,01
I'd been living alone in the
countryside north of bathurst

320
00:21:30,00 --> 00:21:34,69
and working in the attorney-general's
department as a legal officer.

321
00:21:34,71 --> 00:21:39,96
Trying to get a fix on what was wrong
with the world and how to set it right.

322
00:21:41,23 --> 00:21:44,33
Why there were such phenomena as.

323
00:21:44,35 --> 00:21:49,71
Wars especially the war in vietnam for which
i am mongst many other of my age group

324
00:21:49,71 --> 00:21:51,67
then ballot of the in.

325
00:21:51,68 --> 00:21:58,01
The increasing pollution which was
becoming obvious 20 years ago.

326
00:21:59,05 --> 00:21:59,95
Guinness of inner city.

327
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:06,80
These rich poor gap.

328
00:22:06,82 --> 00:22:11,66
Unemployment.

329
00:22:11,67 --> 00:22:17,98
I was part of the post-war baby boom
generation which always grew up with peace

330
00:22:17,98 --> 00:22:22,80
and plenty. Vietnam war was
an enormous culture shock.

331
00:22:23,05 --> 00:22:26,20
I think to all of my generation

332
00:22:27,22 --> 00:22:32,42
that such a horrific occurrence
could embroil us personally.

333
00:22:36,29 --> 00:22:39,62
Being conscripted was an
affront to the spirit

334
00:22:39,62 --> 00:22:46,94
and conscience to fight a wall in which
there was little intellectual belief.

335
00:22:46,96 --> 00:22:49,28
After the war of course
whitlam came to power.

336
00:22:49,98 --> 00:22:54,62
That was a euphoria.

337
00:22:55,99 --> 00:23:02,04
Suddenly the possibility of really
building examples of utopian lifestyle in

338
00:23:02,04 --> 00:23:02,71
australia

339
00:23:03,41 --> 00:23:10,03
and evidencing a low impact low demand
way of life which made big centralized

340
00:23:10,03 --> 00:23:11,03
government unnecessary.

341
00:23:13,09 --> 00:23:16,24
Allowed people to only work a
day or two a week for income

342
00:23:17,05 --> 00:23:18,52
and the rest of the time either.

343
00:23:18,84 --> 00:23:21,25
For some subsistence farming
or building their own homes.

344
00:23:22,58 --> 00:23:27,19
Exploring the finer things of
life music reading meditation.

345
00:23:29,93 --> 00:23:35,39
This whole utopian vista became possible
of implementation or so it seemed.

346
00:23:39,68 --> 00:23:42,89
Then the queries festival
was held in may of 1973.

347
00:23:45,37 --> 00:23:49,43
It was a coming together
of this flower power.

348
00:23:49,45 --> 00:23:53,24
Hope love idealism.

349
00:23:54,20 --> 00:23:59,06
Sense of empathy between people which.

350
00:24:00,67 --> 00:24:02,96
It was the product of.

351
00:24:02,97 --> 00:24:09,66
That post-war generation coming up against
the ugliness of vietnam conflict.

352
00:24:10,98 --> 00:24:17,12
And i'm sure psychedelic drugs had a lot
to do with it quite a unique generation

353
00:24:17,12 --> 00:24:20,27
looking back.

354
00:24:20,29 --> 00:24:26,25
And out of the aquarius festival came
the project of buying a property

355
00:24:27,10 --> 00:24:31,28
and setting up a permanent
sustainable community.

356
00:24:33,15 --> 00:24:40,87
In dwelling those ideals which we
held during the previous decade.

357
00:24:41,74 --> 00:24:45,18
Chairs were sold for a mere
200 dollars intangible falls.

358
00:24:47,51 --> 00:24:51,79
Gradually these were sold to some
people who bought a share and an idea.

359
00:24:52,11 --> 00:24:53,49
Others who came to settle here.

360
00:24:54,19 --> 00:24:55,35
And within two

361
00:24:55,35 --> 00:25:00,42
or three years this entire property hundred
four thousand dollars a been subscribed

362
00:25:00,42 --> 00:25:07,26
to and paid off. The valley.

363
00:25:07,28 --> 00:25:14,16
Spearing in from the south to the nightcap
range with spur lines running down into

364
00:25:14,16 --> 00:25:19,55
the clear valley and
timber along the ridges.

365
00:25:20,33 --> 00:25:26,76
The initial settlers. Varying
and between 40 and 70 or so.

366
00:25:28,59 --> 00:25:33,44
Mostly lived together in the old farmhouse
per cent of the property which was

367
00:25:33,44 --> 00:25:38,21
painted white. It was ironically called
the white house. At the north end.

368
00:25:39,99 --> 00:25:46,21
Was another worker's cottage where a
group of 15 or 20 centered themselves.

369
00:25:46,22 --> 00:25:53,18
Say in this surely the
political motivation

370
00:25:53,18 --> 00:25:56,10
would have been close to communist utopia.

371
00:25:56,12 --> 00:25:59,81
Now the idea was everyone living
and working together. In.

372
00:26:00,90 --> 00:26:03,40
Wholly happy organism.

373
00:26:04,93 --> 00:26:05,50
But within a year

374
00:26:05,50 --> 00:26:12,66
or so there are a lot of tensions
developing in the workers had the bludgers.

375
00:26:12,68 --> 00:26:17,54
The people who went particular
to drugs hated those who were.

376
00:26:18,84 --> 00:26:24,01
Wanted to be smoking or. Magic
mushrooms and so on all the time.

377
00:26:25,28 --> 00:26:30,77
Vegetarians didn't like the meat eaters
for one reason or another. The initial.

378
00:26:30,79 --> 00:26:35,42
Communist utopia. Fell apart and.

379
00:26:35,44 --> 00:26:39,59
Groups of people who were
basically like minded went off

380
00:26:39,59 --> 00:26:45,42
and pioneered hamlet settlements on the
spur lines coming down into the valleys.

381
00:26:45,43 --> 00:26:46,23
Very quickly.

382
00:26:46,53 --> 00:26:53,21
There were 15 20 maybe 30 of these
little hamlets groups of 3 5 6

383
00:26:53,21 --> 00:26:58,93
households. In the house.

384
00:26:58,95 --> 00:27:03,54
That's the settlers were semi-autonomous
from the co-operative course all the land

385
00:27:03,54 --> 00:27:07,27
belong to the co-operative there was no
survey title given to any individual

386
00:27:07,27 --> 00:27:11,71
shareholder.

387
00:27:12,45 --> 00:27:15,15
People started building homes
and it quickly became realised

388
00:27:15,15 --> 00:27:19,14
that some sort of control was necessary.

389
00:27:19,15 --> 00:27:22,68
One big a-frame was built
high up on a ridge.

390
00:27:22,70 --> 00:27:26,14
Its roof obvious up and down the
entire length of the valley.

391
00:27:26,16 --> 00:27:30,38
And rules were quickly passed that people
who wanted to build houses had to get.

392
00:27:30,98 --> 00:27:32,93
Co-operative approval first.

393
00:27:33,60 --> 00:27:36,70
A flag had to be raised to the
height of the intended roof

394
00:27:36,70 --> 00:27:39,31
and otis given it a month later
approval could be sought.

395
00:27:41,57 --> 00:27:46,25
And then the local council got in on the
act too and required building plans.

396
00:27:46,27 --> 00:27:51,25
So the co-operative made it a condition
of granting the approval that.

397
00:27:51,27 --> 00:27:57,94
Council approval bought plans be filed
with the secretary at the same time.

398
00:28:01,45 --> 00:28:03,12
Some people built their own homes.

399
00:28:04,58 --> 00:28:09,97
Normas for a riot of homes often just
small timber cabins with a single room

400
00:28:09,97 --> 00:28:15,53
and of aranda. Sometimes.

401
00:28:15,55 --> 00:28:21,81
Homes which approximated in size a
normal australian suburban home.

402
00:28:21,83 --> 00:28:25,74
Sometimes quite rare. Unusual buildings.

403
00:28:27,37 --> 00:28:29,94
A stone house or.

404
00:28:29,96 --> 00:28:34,83
A fair i cement dome.

405
00:28:37,35 --> 00:28:43,28
People pretty well left each other
alone. Those who are industrious.

406
00:28:43,29 --> 00:28:46,98
Worked at building their
homes. Planting orchards.

407
00:28:48,12 --> 00:28:54,80
Others quickly built a bit of
shelter and. Perhaps did nothing.

408
00:28:54,98 --> 00:28:59,85
After that. Or perhaps focus that
energies on some aspect of music

409
00:29:00,60 --> 00:29:02,12
or.

410
00:29:02,14 --> 00:29:12,00
Environmental activism.

411
00:29:13,31 --> 00:29:18,58
The cooperative meets at an annual general
meeting once a year and elects a board.

412
00:29:20,38 --> 00:29:25,53
Under the rules of the cooperative the
board has ultimate power to make decisions

413
00:29:25,53 --> 00:29:26,02
for

414
00:29:26,02 --> 00:29:33,28
and binding upon the entire
community will shareholders.

415
00:29:33,29 --> 00:29:37,49
For a long time the elected
board was more or less nominal.

416
00:29:38,88 --> 00:29:45,07
It didn't exercise any independent power
because this invited accusations of being.

417
00:29:46,47 --> 00:29:53,14
Some sort of fascist totalitarian.
The community instead.

418
00:29:53,16 --> 00:29:59,94
Met every month at what was called a tribal
meeting and it was this and more for.

419
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,21
Yes meeting of never happened to turn
up once a month which tended to make

420
00:30:03,21 --> 00:30:08,06
decisions and from time to
time implement them. Alive.

421
00:30:08,17 --> 00:30:12,31
My observation would be
that. And still is that.

422
00:30:12,99 --> 00:30:17,93
Most people are very loath to act as
policemen a lot of decisions have been made

423
00:30:17,93 --> 00:30:21,90
over and over again reinventing the
wheel over the years not enforced

424
00:30:21,90 --> 00:30:24,85
or implemented.

425
00:30:26,25 --> 00:30:29,64
But perhaps gradually there's
building up a consciousness of.

426
00:30:30,87 --> 00:30:32,51
What will be disciplined

427
00:30:32,51 --> 00:30:39,72
and what will be tolerated.

428
00:30:41,46 --> 00:30:46,09
Very liberty liberty liberal little else
liberal communities grown out of it.

429
00:30:46,20 --> 00:30:51,51
Sin or most tolerance for differences.

430
00:30:51,52 --> 00:30:55,82
Folk tend to leave each other alone
unless they absolutely transgress the

431
00:30:55,82 --> 00:31:04,57
guidelines.

432
00:31:04,59 --> 00:31:08,06
It's always sad and be that
there's been so little endeavour.

433
00:31:08,59 --> 00:31:13,57
As regards growing orchards
and vegetable gardens.

434
00:31:14,84 --> 00:31:19,76
There's still a lot of
weeds on the hillsides.

435
00:31:19,78 --> 00:31:24,01
There's still a lot of dependence on
welfare. When one would have hoped.

436
00:31:24,63 --> 00:31:25,90
Folk would be into.
