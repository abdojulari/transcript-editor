20
00:01:26,31 --> 00:01:30,98
a holder or how old or up. Did you work
on the arts or in the workshops need from

21
00:01:30,98 --> 00:01:36,36

00:01:36,53 --> 00:01:40,46
you describe the job of holding up. Can
you how it goes on. Yes. Where do you get

23
00:01:40,46 --> 00:01:41,38
a call as

24
00:01:41,38 --> 00:01:48,32
a rattler dulÃ©. Nigga adjusted to
the rivet page stated if you want

25
00:01:48,32 --> 00:01:54,67
opinion and. Even the riveter can you put
it in the hole and put this rattler gully

26
00:01:54,67 --> 00:02:00,80
on an atlas and the other side knocked the
river down. Who was the the rivets were

27
00:02:00,80 --> 00:02:01,86
all sent down to you and

28
00:02:01,86 --> 00:02:06,83
a compressed air line web site at the
finish. But at the beginning it capped at

29
00:02:07,80 --> 00:02:12,80
first no ordinary cook trying to divert
for five in the parrot once and then kid.

30
00:02:12,88 --> 00:02:13,62
Vol.

31
00:02:13,62 --> 00:02:18,53
Number until they got more hot and and
minutes time to put one in the hole to give

32
00:02:18,53 --> 00:02:20,01
it a hold on to give the hole on

33
00:02:20,01 --> 00:02:24,00
a fitted and evident up to down. What
if you were close enough. He'd hand it

34
00:02:24,00 --> 00:02:30,32
straight over seven mostly worked on the
approach is particularly are you were

35
00:02:30,32 --> 00:02:34,22
quite right along the approaches that you
read along to the very beginning of the

36
00:02:34,22 --> 00:02:37,97
middle and then on the
roadway to. Four and

37
00:02:37,97 --> 00:02:44,47
a half years. To was the one was the work
very hard very very hard work because the

38
00:02:44,47 --> 00:02:45,32
you had

39
00:02:45,32 --> 00:02:49,57
a drift every hole pretty just threw every
hole with no teacher thing is reaming or

40
00:02:49,57 --> 00:02:51,36
anything like that they all had

41
00:02:51,36 --> 00:02:57,18
a very distinct until you get the rivet in.
And what was the conditions like inside

42
00:02:57,18 --> 00:03:03,70
the cords very hard and they're always
on the arch was always on a slope in

43
00:03:03,70 --> 00:03:10,44
a hurry. It was always seem to be in
two years you can think. Do you know

44
00:03:10,44 --> 00:03:15,82
remember any particular dangerous incidents
where you were nearly in trouble

45
00:03:15,82 --> 00:03:22,71
yourself. Well yes i can sure you might
hear. I was working down and put don't know

46
00:03:22,71 --> 00:03:28,26
and the bottom cord an area that
fell from another on top and make it

47
00:03:28,26 --> 00:03:35,17
a don't and i see it took me to set policies
teeth and black and you can see the

48
00:03:35,17 --> 00:03:39,75
mike there yet. And incidentally no
compensation for broken teeth rennie thing in

49
00:03:39,75 --> 00:03:45,71
those days. So you got no compensation for
that comes only just come before we know

50
00:03:45,71 --> 00:03:46,36
but not from

51
00:03:46,36 --> 00:03:52,63
a teeth never broken beyond repair. Who
are you. When you burn to death with

52
00:03:52,63 --> 00:03:54,07
a cricket was

53
00:03:54,07 --> 00:04:00,19
a call to open the top and then just read
up the face and two black eyes. How long

54
00:04:00,19 --> 00:04:04,99
we are off. I can tell you no suppose about
it. It was long time ago and the idea

55
00:04:04,99 --> 00:04:10,15
because the first two member any incidents
that happen to other people dangerous

56
00:04:10,15 --> 00:04:15,75
incidents. Well i serve make needed getting
killed. He was the first one to get

57
00:04:15,75 --> 00:04:20,23
hill scratch up call mcneill i can't
think of his first team for to

58
00:04:20,23 --> 00:04:25,18
a knocking off and had to get work on the
approach the very beginning and even then

59
00:04:25,18 --> 00:04:27,91
the latter and he still fairly
was the first have to get

60
00:04:27,91 --> 00:04:31,69
a killer scratched called
mcneill yes he had

61
00:04:31,69 --> 00:04:35,89
a two names actually he was known as it
would make me ill and the tamil swan bells

62
00:04:35,89 --> 00:04:39,31
. So they covered i don't
buy make nearly as

63
00:04:39,31 --> 00:04:45,73
a moment. Very well and i was at that show.
Practically per say them as haven't i

64
00:04:45,74 --> 00:04:51,01
can remember any other incidents like where
i was clearly huge just like that now

65
00:04:51,85 --> 00:04:57,60
nearest cape so you had and of it only
heard and then in germany near misses near

66
00:04:57,60 --> 00:05:03,45
nearest grapes and very likely all the way
through years going to be carefree and i

67
00:05:03,45 --> 00:05:08,95
was careful if we all told all told to
be very very careful to no how much

68
00:05:08,95 --> 00:05:15,95
a week. You got yesterday for turn
eighteen plus whatever hate deva working

69
00:05:15,95 --> 00:05:17,92
on forever elevation that had

70
00:05:17,92 --> 00:05:24,28
a vehicle. For the end up the more you got
her that's in the middle. I think you

71
00:05:24,28 --> 00:05:30,33
are getting more money then you're
weeks wages were. Do you remember

72
00:05:31,16 --> 00:05:36,20
whether that was much more than you
got in ireland quite a lot more quite

73
00:05:36,20 --> 00:05:40,14
a lot more it was much work and ireland
there was data and i left there was is

74
00:05:40,14 --> 00:05:45,26
a passion which is starting them didn't
had to stay live till the foot 1928

75
00:05:45,26 --> 00:05:50,69
twenty nine. And when you finished up on
the bridge were you out of work or did you

76
00:05:50,69 --> 00:05:54,46
get a job. Everybody else he was out of
work there for months and then you got

77
00:05:54,46 --> 00:06:01,38
a job in new guinea and i stayed there
for twenty one years. Except for

78
00:06:01,38 --> 00:06:08,35
the evacuation evacuated during
the war. That building gold

79
00:06:08,35 --> 00:06:11,33
dredges in a first class building
all day just with a rule

80
00:06:11,33 --> 00:06:15,27
a golden age in company. I went back
there after the war and say there's

81
00:06:15,27 --> 00:06:20,47
a name 10:53 and that and the waif
and everyone terrible at it had

82
00:06:20,47 --> 00:06:25,96
a nuff so give it away. For him
back again to the to the bridge

83
00:06:27,59 --> 00:06:31,54
. On the approach spans when you were
working along were. Was there anything

84
00:06:32,89 --> 00:06:36,89
anything different about working
on them. Oh yes it was just

85
00:06:36,89 --> 00:06:38,94
a whole street level go
on the murder of you

86
00:06:38,94 --> 00:06:41,80
a world level but on the arches
the said in the audience

87
00:06:41,80 --> 00:06:48,29
a chord you were always on the slope. And
it was pretty sore in your feet. It had

88
00:06:48,29 --> 00:06:53,52
at the end of the day. Do you remember about
the working conditions in those days.

89
00:06:53,63 --> 00:06:54,54
Yes

90
00:06:54,54 --> 00:07:01,39
a there is no locker rooms are just
the humpy next door to where they

91
00:07:02,93 --> 00:07:06,18
pick up boys for the wifely average but
there's no locker room just to hang your

92
00:07:06,18 --> 00:07:10,51
coat up there when the whistle blowers pay
the clock you didn't knock off the five

93
00:07:10,51 --> 00:07:16,47
no washbasin just picture caught on to
cure overalls of come home that was it was

94
00:07:16,48 --> 00:07:23,45
nothing no time will wash up for anything
like that now. Do you remember any union

95
00:07:23,45 --> 00:07:27,29
activity what do you know you're in those
days i was in there in virginia in those

96
00:07:27,29 --> 00:07:33,72
days and at the local tunick i think with
the secretary snow we didn't have much

97
00:07:33,72 --> 00:07:39,95
travel but weather was her greatest trouble.
The company said oh you can work if

98
00:07:39,95 --> 00:07:44,43
you want to. But the department of main
roads which you really can't work in the

99
00:07:44,43 --> 00:07:49,88
rain and because the contracts the rivets
and wrecks the rivers who were there. Yes

100
00:07:49,88 --> 00:07:53,73
between the both ims and one when did we
get work wanted we couldn't have its way

101
00:07:53,73 --> 00:08:00,38
into the papers twenty minutes never did
they. It was pretty hard. Do you remember

102
00:08:00,38 --> 00:08:05,51
also whether there was a me
lunch. Arranges where you had

103
00:08:05,51 --> 00:08:10,75
a lunch room or anything like that.
No lunch just in this humpy or e have

104
00:08:10,75 --> 00:08:14,54
a red strand they are a kind of
thing in the wintertime itself in

105
00:08:14,54 --> 00:08:20,35
a garden old you know lunchrooms new to
continue nothing like that now with the

106
00:08:20,35 --> 00:08:26,10
court slippery in the morning. Yes there
were always two wet or something like that

107
00:08:26,10 --> 00:08:31,44
. And when the time was. When the wind
blows it is very very cold and wet and

108
00:08:31,44 --> 00:08:34,55
miserable to get warmed
up a bit when she had

109
00:08:34,55 --> 00:08:40,88
a few bits in there in the cord well-studied
warm up of it. Remember getting burnt

110
00:08:40,88 --> 00:08:46,19
at all. Now and i used to wear long gloves
to hear countless no use to keep those

111
00:08:46,19 --> 00:08:51,20
on mostly all day and i think it went out
about scaling their boots and yes they

112
00:08:52,35 --> 00:08:57,39
had their it ever had good boots to wear
years out of the village. How did you keep

113
00:08:57,39 --> 00:09:01,75
the scale out of the tops of the boots.
You're over also came over the top of me

114
00:09:01,75 --> 00:09:07,31
and it and didn't much much chance and
that. Several in the workshops used to get

115
00:09:07,31 --> 00:09:11,58
claims for compensation because the scale
in their boots. They did and therefore

116
00:09:11,58 --> 00:09:16,10
have treated and get that they say very
much. Only worked in the shop two months

117
00:09:16,10 --> 00:09:22,53
and then they wanted said. Had left cover
too and then went straight vigin that

118
00:09:23,32 --> 00:09:27,62
tova and paid just before christmas that
year twenty six haven't stayed and stayed

119
00:09:27,62 --> 00:09:33,94
thirty one. Were you up on the arch when
it was joined. Yes i was up nights but we

120
00:09:33,94 --> 00:09:39,83
weren't allowed near little mr innes
knees. People were all there. There for

121
00:09:39,83 --> 00:09:43,62
a little reason there and what have you.
And we were just fact cheered when it

122
00:09:43,62 --> 00:09:49,55
happened. Did you were you there. The
following morning when it went up to canberra

123
00:09:49,55 --> 00:09:55,59
to bob a good mechanic. That was like a
lot more change we got to the ship in

124
00:09:55,59 --> 00:10:02,13
a circular quay at went west. So
you didn't get yours engraved

125
00:10:02,13 --> 00:10:08,37
bone. You didn't get yours engraved no
i didn't. Expanded that discipline.

126
00:10:09,09 --> 00:10:13,30
Well i'm told by some of the
people that they're worth

127
00:10:13,30 --> 00:10:17,09
a thousand dollars. Now i don't know there's
any truth in this. I don't think it

128
00:10:17,09 --> 00:10:23,57
looked in that they get it. Is there
any other events you can remember

129
00:10:24,43 --> 00:10:28,69
while they were working up there.

130
00:10:31,56 --> 00:10:35,36
Do you remember the rigging of the staging
was it good work. Yes it was very good

131
00:10:35,36 --> 00:10:40,81
work said daley was there was the foreman
there and. Tappy evans is one of his

132
00:10:40,81 --> 00:10:46,96
squad and i knew him very well and he
went in new guinea also have that image.

133
00:10:47,21 --> 00:10:53,51
Everything was rated you could hardly
for trade and lacy. But everything was

134
00:10:53,51 --> 00:10:58,80
permanent except for you. Who didn't have
any safety ropes everywhere or safety

135
00:10:58,80 --> 00:11:01,41
nets to the unknown. Oh
nothing like that only

136
00:11:01,41 --> 00:11:06,62
a rope around the stage of his early that
just stand there and hold it said daly

137
00:11:06,62 --> 00:11:10,14
said the power of feeling kept you
see it kinda thing just turned

138
00:11:10,14 --> 00:11:16,84
a moment. Do you remember who the
dog when the riggers were. Ben

139
00:11:16,85 --> 00:11:23,38
i forget is of the name and the leading
hand nigga jack benson. Ben used to

140
00:11:23,38 --> 00:11:28,57
have the phones in the telephone
to talk to clean and jack king

141
00:11:30,35 --> 00:11:36,76
wanted of much lower the fitter all fit
the causes of this coming into position.

142
00:11:36,78 --> 00:11:43,59
Do you remember any of our other crime
drivers do now. They were on the so say they

143
00:11:43,59 --> 00:11:48,63
never worked on this side but you had
three or four kind drivers in the creeper

144
00:11:48,63 --> 00:11:54,04
crammed into and i was only one
and so said me didn't work on

145
00:11:54,04 --> 00:11:59,25
a shift when it was day shift and the king
was the only one that i know and i don't

146
00:11:59,25 --> 00:12:02,97
mean that i was trying to understand that
there were several chrome drivers in the

147
00:12:02,97 --> 00:12:05,08
one you know all the
cranes on around there was

148
00:12:05,08 --> 00:12:06,49
a walking crane along the front had

149
00:12:06,49 --> 00:12:10,61
a driver the main creeper crone had the
driver and then they had drivers for around

150
00:12:10,61 --> 00:12:16,30
the back for the for lifting your tools up
and that sort of thing you know kind of

151
00:12:16,30 --> 00:12:22,17
over there was really when was the main
ones and it's all home. How did you go up

152
00:12:22,17 --> 00:12:24,75
in the cradle. We went up in that box

153
00:12:24,75 --> 00:12:31,46
a fair and pointed left the front
and that's for the arch front turn

154
00:12:31,46 --> 00:12:37,19
in the sturgis way and with it for fifty
feet and. Was just an ordinary box of

155
00:12:37,19 --> 00:12:42,42
boards and when it came to the vigil very
very would grasp it. And hang on and get

156
00:12:42,42 --> 00:12:45,28
a just quick is a kidney seam
coming down a delay. She was

157
00:12:45,28 --> 00:12:46,69
a walk the walk of which is

158
00:12:46,69 --> 00:12:52,87
a long way to go which crane driver
drove. Joking. He drove as well

159
00:12:53,60 --> 00:12:57,19
from the he drove that from the creeper
cree and because there was anyway it could

160
00:12:57,19 --> 00:13:01,71
come up. Yes. It was red. He drew the even
if there was only create and there are

161
00:13:01,71 --> 00:13:06,49
today. Remember yes. This is just that
several people have told me that there were

162
00:13:06,49 --> 00:13:11,84
more than one crane driver on that until i
can see at least three drivers boxes on

163
00:13:11,84 --> 00:13:17,71
the on the creeper cram one for the main
crane for lifting the main left all around

164
00:13:17,71 --> 00:13:18,46
the place and they had

165
00:13:18,46 --> 00:13:22,20
a jigger hoist which went on the on the
end of that and then there was also

166
00:13:22,20 --> 00:13:25,24
a walking crane that went along
separately underneath and that's got

167
00:13:25,24 --> 00:13:28,55
a chrome travis box which is separate from
the other one i just wondering who are

168
00:13:28,55 --> 00:13:33,80
drove the other one. I can't remember that
and i really can't remember that. Now i

169
00:13:33,80 --> 00:13:40,17
think anymore do you remember anything else
about about going up and down. Did you

170
00:13:40,17 --> 00:13:44,55
always get get the credit allotted sometimes
have to walk when they started when

171
00:13:44,55 --> 00:13:48,87
they got the road way they started then
they put an elevator. Again the thing in

172
00:13:48,87 --> 00:13:53,50
that was easy. Just as in the grand
with it. Elevated no good and took

173
00:13:53,50 --> 00:13:57,73
a turn to put on the active was nothing
like that. You know they all went up in

174
00:13:57,73 --> 00:14:02,97
this box and waited and frontin in the
water the middle of the harbour if it was

175
00:14:02,97 --> 00:14:09,09
and he food and condone get known but
i tell you what i do and no need to

176
00:14:10,32 --> 00:14:16,26
judge. Lucas he was the judge at that time
of their of attrition and he was the one

177
00:14:16,26 --> 00:14:20,30
to decide how much money they should have
gotten but we didn't get their hate money

178
00:14:20,30 --> 00:14:22,88
. This particular day came down for

179
00:14:22,88 --> 00:14:29,46
a tad and sell so many get on that pontoon
box in the middle of the harbor. It

180
00:14:29,46 --> 00:14:33,02
started to blow and swear that but it
didn't go up that up this way and was too

181
00:14:33,02 --> 00:14:39,93
much you come down. We got our money.
That's true. Remember that. There's

182
00:14:39,93 --> 00:14:41,92
some of these said that the
mauve occasion they had

183
00:14:41,92 --> 00:14:46,07
a number of politicians came out of. To
try it out and they had crawled across

184
00:14:46,07 --> 00:14:51,14
various bits and pieces. Credibly that i
remember something like that pretended and

185
00:14:51,14 --> 00:14:55,94
see it myself but i remember that george
lucas very well. He never even got up the

186
00:14:55,94 --> 00:15:02,73
talk. Do you remember the
difference between working in

187
00:15:02,73 --> 00:15:08,57
freedom and longs in sydney and working for
harlem wharf in belfast. Yes and whole

188
00:15:08,57 --> 00:15:13,13
world our ownership particularly this is
the indian works which i didn't work with

189
00:15:13,13 --> 00:15:16,52
there for the ownership.
When you start working on

190
00:15:16,52 --> 00:15:21,61
a ship. He just take your coat off
and hang it up on a nail and then

191
00:15:21,61 --> 00:15:27,71
a boat or river the nearest to you and
leave it there and and lunchtime comes you

192
00:15:27,71 --> 00:15:31,39
have learned just a round of it.
There is no comfort. I have

193
00:15:31,39 --> 00:15:36,13
a conduct no way should do nothing. Just
take your coat put it on the get off nine

194
00:15:36,13 --> 00:15:42,46
your way home. Anything else. And

195
00:15:45,94 --> 00:15:47,08
jim member they had

196
00:15:47,08 --> 00:15:52,08
a washing facilities and fast washing
facilities and certainly for that matter. He

197
00:15:52,09 --> 00:15:55,16
didn't have any working facilities and
there was person who was there and there's

198
00:15:55,16 --> 00:16:01,64
not very many in sydney and certainly he
had to wonder why in dorm long's you had

199
00:16:01,64 --> 00:16:05,03
a desert in your own tent there's no five
minutes for anything allowed away she

200
00:16:05,03 --> 00:16:11,13
just and people that live very handy.
They just didn't buy they just particular

201
00:16:11,13 --> 00:16:14,39
tournament home.
