1
00:00:12,74 --> 00:00:14,44
This is parents a broken interviewing

2
00:00:14,44 --> 00:00:20,04
when a parent in this more
on the 7th of april 1993

3
00:00:21,61 --> 00:00:23,71
rina where and when will you go on.

4
00:00:25,14 --> 00:00:30,85
I was born in italy in a small
town there in northern italy.

5
00:00:31,90 --> 00:00:36,42
It is near about two hours away
from venice to be near field.

6
00:00:36,90 --> 00:00:40,14
Idea of what the actual town was combat.

7
00:00:42,61 --> 00:00:45,08
And. Time. What day.

8
00:00:45,17 --> 00:00:49,14
What date were you born for you here
fishing for my age are your parents.

9
00:00:50,64 --> 00:00:56,10
I came on the third on the 1st of 1927.

10
00:00:57,57 --> 00:01:02,45
I was born on a very cold january day they
tell me because it's winter into me in

11
00:01:02,45 --> 00:01:05,40
january and i was very sickly

12
00:01:05,40 --> 00:01:10,56
and no one expected me limp as a matter of
fact i musta kept me downstairs to keep

13
00:01:10,56 --> 00:01:13,28
me more because my mother told me and

14
00:01:13,28 --> 00:01:17,12
when i was in italy my ninety
two year old aunty also told me

15
00:01:17,12 --> 00:01:21,95
that she remembered when i was born
and my father came down that morning.

16
00:01:22,13 --> 00:01:27,13
You know and he said if you dead
yet. And mum said no not yet.

17
00:01:28,10 --> 00:01:32,34
And this is true because well i suppose
i'm sorry i think of having kids.

18
00:01:32,36 --> 00:01:35,86
I will be a and how many children

19
00:01:35,86 --> 00:01:41,36
that they have all together are actually
seven for my mum had i didn't survive.

20
00:01:42,90 --> 00:01:43,11
Yes.

21
00:01:44,39 --> 00:01:51,02
One of those was a nun actually in my she
would have been my elder silda teresa she

22
00:01:51,02 --> 00:01:55,41
was a man she died a 28 mccone and
in italy in italy is you know.

23
00:01:56,64 --> 00:01:59,68
So do you remember much of
easily. You know i don't.

24
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,72
Remember any late all you know
i don't remember any at all

25
00:02:03,98 --> 00:02:07,19
and we sort of know what they
spoke about in the family.

26
00:02:07,24 --> 00:02:10,75
But as far as me remembering though that.

27
00:02:11,22 --> 00:02:16,93
I can remember my mother sort of saying
you know how very strict the catholic

28
00:02:16,93 --> 00:02:19,06
church was you know

29
00:02:19,06 --> 00:02:26,72
when you have to abide more
as one of their rules.

30
00:02:26,74 --> 00:02:29,86
Rena how old were you when you
when you came when you left italy

31
00:02:29,86 --> 00:02:31,40
and came out here to australia.

32
00:02:31,48 --> 00:02:35,90
Well i had my four four
birthday i'm about coming out.

33
00:02:36,00 --> 00:02:40,79
Do you remember the name of the day we are
all more on the side i think it was my

34
00:02:40,79 --> 00:02:43,51
sister tell me that the other
day on the remember me.

35
00:02:45,24 --> 00:02:46,71
Yes and we arrived in italy australia

36
00:02:46,71 --> 00:02:52,63
and i don't remember anything about the
trip but i remember a street in sydney

37
00:02:53,70 --> 00:02:59,67
and my brother jack had come to
me those and now im of course

38
00:02:59,67 --> 00:03:02,94
and i say i asked mum i was
walking along holding mum's hand

39
00:03:02,94 --> 00:03:06,30
and i had my little bag of lollies in
my hand and i think you know i offer

40
00:03:06,30 --> 00:03:11,51
that man some and she
said yes. So you know.

41
00:03:11,53 --> 00:03:15,82
My brother had actually left it
me when i was a two weeks old.

42
00:03:16,16 --> 00:03:17,69
So he was already in australia.

43
00:03:17,75 --> 00:03:22,45
Yet he left italy in 19 27

44
00:03:22,46 --> 00:03:29,38
and i was born in the antilles
later my father came out in

45
00:03:29,39 --> 00:03:32,46
two years again after
that we came out in 1931.

46
00:03:32,60 --> 00:03:38,26
And what with the attraction for your
brother did he did he have any friends out

47
00:03:38,26 --> 00:03:40,26
here. You know he knew nobody at all.

48
00:03:40,46 --> 00:03:46,61
The only attraction was to get out
immediately because life was so very hard.

49
00:03:47,95 --> 00:03:50,18
The reality of brothers
and sisters coming on.

50
00:03:50,31 --> 00:03:54,36
So that the oldest man

51
00:03:54,37 --> 00:03:59,56
or two boys really because he was barely
18. They were the ones to leave home.

52
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,48
There was no work there were
no where they could go.

53
00:04:02,89 --> 00:04:07,02
And so they migrated and
i think in those days.

54
00:04:07,41 --> 00:04:11,06
Immigration to australia was the
easiest from what i think you know.

55
00:04:11,95 --> 00:04:16,08
Do you think that was hard for your
mother and father when he left the family

56
00:04:16,08 --> 00:04:19,71
and travel. It wouldn't mean it
would have been hard because.

57
00:04:19,73 --> 00:04:22,39
I mean just imagine my mother
in the two weeks old baby

58
00:04:22,39 --> 00:04:26,26
and then one her elder son
leaving it would have been hard

59
00:04:27,25 --> 00:04:29,85
but i think you could
conditioned to these things.

60
00:04:30,24 --> 00:04:34,81
Another way they hadn't immediately
at the time of surviving was

61
00:04:38,12 --> 00:04:43,17
probably 12 league school
and 12 they would be.

62
00:04:44,09 --> 00:04:47,26
Put out to a natural place
or to a friend's place

63
00:04:48,35 --> 00:04:52,22
and there they would meet
there and from board and food

64
00:04:53,08 --> 00:04:56,57
and probably they were lucky to get
a change of clothes but that meant

65
00:04:56,57 --> 00:05:00,87
that the family didn't have to feed
them. So that's what they need.

66
00:05:01,82 --> 00:05:06,12
So instead of that a lot
didn't migrate. And.

67
00:05:07,65 --> 00:05:10,39
When your father came out.

68
00:05:10,40 --> 00:05:16,00
He came out follow your brother to your
brother have anything out here to attract a

69
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:19,30
father or with the intention
to bring the whole family

70
00:05:19,30 --> 00:05:23,13
and now i think the intention was
to bring the whole family out.

71
00:05:23,17 --> 00:05:25,13
Yes i think that's how they planned it.

72
00:05:26,58 --> 00:05:28,58
My brother didn't have any bananas

73
00:05:28,58 --> 00:05:31,19
or anything at the time he had
been working on dairy farm.

74
00:05:31,71 --> 00:05:32,70
Mostly dairy

75
00:05:35,06 --> 00:05:39,03
that used to get it on the land you
know week you know week that you.

76
00:05:39,39 --> 00:05:43,94
But i believe you did stay on a dairy
farm falls out of tundra creek

77
00:05:43,94 --> 00:05:50,66
or for a long while. So when
your brother came out he he.

78
00:05:50,67 --> 00:05:52,59
First it was his first port of call.

79
00:05:53,79 --> 00:05:57,10
Well it would have the same but
in sydney and then you came up

80
00:05:57,10 --> 00:05:58,92
and you came straight to lismore.

81
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:01,60
And that's what brought your father

82
00:06:01,60 --> 00:06:05,90
and the rest of the family tree as you know
you see where the thread originated he

83
00:06:05,90 --> 00:06:12,60
was the original one. He was sort of. Working
very hard for him here you know once.

84
00:06:12,66 --> 00:06:15,66
Yes it must have been very hard
because he didn't know the language

85
00:06:17,22 --> 00:06:22,37
but having to go to australian families
in a way helped him because he learnt a

86
00:06:22,37 --> 00:06:23,51
language really quickly.

87
00:06:24,22 --> 00:06:24,65
So that

88
00:06:24,65 --> 00:06:28,79
when we come out four years later he could
speak very well if he's still alive.

89
00:06:29,08 --> 00:06:34,89
No no no he died a few years
ago. What was his name giuliani.

90
00:06:35,70 --> 00:06:41,04
Do you remember any stories that he might
have told about his arrival in australia.

91
00:06:41,11 --> 00:06:47,86
No no you never ever really speak
very much about it you know except

92
00:06:47,87 --> 00:06:49,64
that he had to go clean carving.

93
00:06:50,75 --> 00:06:55,98
Which was very hard because in those
days it was all done not only by hand

94
00:06:55,98 --> 00:07:01,09
but the kind wasn't burnt
they had a load by hand.

95
00:07:01,27 --> 00:07:03,67
So it was very hard and at 18 and 19

96
00:07:03,67 --> 00:07:08,13
that what would have been a
very hard they work to do

97
00:07:08,13 --> 00:07:11,59
that guy only for the
season he went to in india

98
00:07:11,60 --> 00:07:17,32
that for a few years even after we came.
You did your father do that kind of work.

99
00:07:17,35 --> 00:07:18,12
No no.

100
00:07:18,14 --> 00:07:23,92
He only worked on bananas after they came
here i think they got a piece of land

101
00:07:23,92 --> 00:07:29,89
and planted ananas so that when we arrived
they actually had the bananas planted.

102
00:07:31,19 --> 00:07:33,94
Did your brother did he marry
you know girl i mean it.

103
00:07:33,99 --> 00:07:37,80
You know we didn't he went back to italy
to get married. Yes he went back.

104
00:07:38,41 --> 00:07:40,61
And did he bring his wife christine.

105
00:07:40,62 --> 00:07:43,28
Yes oh yes but they came out

106
00:07:43,28 --> 00:07:49,00
and they lived in the family actually with
the family which was quite acceptable in

107
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:51,26
those days you know we used to

108
00:07:51,26 --> 00:07:54,24
that nibbling at what i don't
think it was a them team

109
00:07:54,24 --> 00:07:59,65
and you know rina on the
out on the side how many.

110
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,51
Family came out on that on that trip.

111
00:08:06,40 --> 00:08:08,38
My brother constantino and italian.

112
00:08:08,89 --> 00:08:13,00
And my sisters even months and
then you mina and your mother

113
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:19,59
and my mother in law and stories
about the boat trip you know.

114
00:08:21,04 --> 00:08:27,54
They did tell your wife about
them. My brothers and sisters or.

115
00:08:28,12 --> 00:08:32,22
I can remember. Do you remember
having a birthday. Not even that.

116
00:08:32,77 --> 00:08:36,26
You know when when the
boat landed read it.

117
00:08:36,27 --> 00:08:38,36
Where did you land in australia in sydney.

118
00:08:38,37 --> 00:08:44,17
Like i said before you know with that
child our brother. You know. And.

119
00:08:45,39 --> 00:08:49,89
Do you remember your grandparents.
You know not at all. No money.

120
00:08:49,92 --> 00:08:52,10
Did they ever visit you in australia.

121
00:08:52,17 --> 00:08:54,25
Oh no there was no possible way

122
00:08:54,25 --> 00:08:57,42
that they would they wouldn't even
if they could anyway do you know.

123
00:08:57,51 --> 00:09:01,47
Do you know much about them for through
the company what they do you know me very

124
00:09:01,47 --> 00:09:04,82
well. Family farmers my brother.

125
00:09:06,93 --> 00:09:11,83
I mean my father by about four they were
only two boys in the family only had one

126
00:09:11,83 --> 00:09:14,64
brother which was a very very small family

127
00:09:14,64 --> 00:09:20,69
and most days i don't think they use
contraceptives by the way i just think it

128
00:09:20,69 --> 00:09:22,95
happened that my grandmother
didn't produce anymore.

129
00:09:24,96 --> 00:09:30,24
And so they were reasonably well off
sort of thing and they had the two

130
00:09:30,24 --> 00:09:32,61
and my uncle only had two boys

131
00:09:32,61 --> 00:09:37,39
that only agreement we will indeed lee
compared to my mother my mother was a very

132
00:09:37,39 --> 00:09:38,46
good dressmaker.

133
00:09:39,47 --> 00:09:39,63
And

134
00:09:39,64 --> 00:09:45,62
that is how she kept the family going a
lot with my dressmaking what she would do

135
00:09:45,62 --> 00:09:50,78
mostly was she would so probably
rich people of the town

136
00:09:52,06 --> 00:09:55,28
and there were a few around that those
days they would be blamed owners

137
00:09:56,15 --> 00:09:59,82
and they would rent their land
out to leave. So the tenants.

138
00:10:00,80 --> 00:10:02,84
And she would guess we
go into their own home

139
00:10:03,56 --> 00:10:06,86
and just make you machine take the kid.

140
00:10:06,91 --> 00:10:09,36
Or the child but she was breastfeeding

141
00:10:09,36 --> 00:10:13,71
and the others would be left with her sister
in law because the two sister in laws

142
00:10:14,70 --> 00:10:17,39
lived in the same house family but

143
00:10:17,40 --> 00:10:23,79
that was a very small family it wasn't
uncommon to have i've heard of 40 people in

144
00:10:23,80 --> 00:10:27,71
the one house that is the grandmother
grandfather mother father

145
00:10:28,56 --> 00:10:34,33
and married son with autism and
the maritimes and their children.

146
00:10:34,34 --> 00:10:40,57
So that wasn't unusual but. Only
having the two. Two made it easier.

147
00:10:40,71 --> 00:10:42,50
I can remember my mother saying

148
00:10:42,50 --> 00:10:48,07
that one particular no it wasn't
it was one mother sister in law

149
00:10:50,03 --> 00:10:54,85
had triplets and life was very hard

150
00:10:55,93 --> 00:10:56,94
and of course i mean

151
00:10:56,94 --> 00:11:01,88
that my husband was he wouldn't even
think of even looking at the child.

152
00:11:01,89 --> 00:11:04,02
The children said i say so.

153
00:11:04,07 --> 00:11:07,58
She was just at the end of the terror so
she went to the priest to ask for comfort

154
00:11:07,58 --> 00:11:11,12
which is what they all did. You
know they gave him a chance.

155
00:11:12,42 --> 00:11:17,03
So the priest told it to have
patience and to carry the cross lord.

156
00:11:17,04 --> 00:11:21,35
Right across them and she was fed up.

157
00:11:22,26 --> 00:11:26,83
So yes but our lord could have
thrown his cross down if i might win

158
00:11:26,83 --> 00:11:30,53
that put me in jail.

159
00:11:31,92 --> 00:11:38,10
So i think i don't think you got
the comfort they wanted to get.

160
00:11:38,12 --> 00:11:42,71
I mean that's how it was you
know. Did your mother meet you.

161
00:11:42,71 --> 00:11:44,35
Mother and father come
from the same village.

162
00:11:44,74 --> 00:11:48,32
No actually they came from very close

163
00:11:48,32 --> 00:11:52,49
but from a different really
different was it was quite close.

164
00:11:53,92 --> 00:11:59,77
And it was a young women and you know. No
i don't know but they weren't very young.

165
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:06,33
No i won't you know but i suppose i
better get back on going back now

166
00:12:06,33 --> 00:12:10,33
and i we're going to baghdad. I should get
back to where we were here in australia.

167
00:12:11,81 --> 00:12:15,86
So there were five if you
want to buy coming out here

168
00:12:15,86 --> 00:12:18,74
and you had a brother here
in australia already.

169
00:12:18,75 --> 00:12:21,57
And their children left
in italy and the nun.

170
00:12:21,60 --> 00:12:27,16
Yes yes yes that one had gone and
yes she she was very young i think

171
00:12:27,16 --> 00:12:32,49
when she went into but i don't think
of course she never came out.

172
00:12:32,52 --> 00:12:36,46
No you know and mum never saw a game and.

173
00:12:38,15 --> 00:12:40,76
And you mentioned that there was another
child. There are eight children.

174
00:12:41,10 --> 00:12:44,26
Yeah but when they go in very
short but two weeks old.

175
00:12:44,46 --> 00:12:47,49
I think just a baby with
that after you know before.

176
00:12:47,51 --> 00:12:52,10
You know i was the last one of the family.
I was on the youngest not for them.

177
00:12:52,16 --> 00:12:53,70
I don't know.

178
00:12:59,93 --> 00:13:01,07
Yes. When we arrived here.

179
00:13:02,55 --> 00:13:08,68
We actually went into a rented house which
was a little distance behind the school

180
00:13:08,68 --> 00:13:14,28
house a coffee can because you can't school
wasn't in the same place in these now

181
00:13:14,28 --> 00:13:17,73
and this is where your father was living
when he you know when you were around.

182
00:13:17,96 --> 00:13:18,86
Yes a coffee can.

183
00:13:20,45 --> 00:13:23,81
Well actually it would be tween coffee
camp in dubai right up on top of

184
00:13:23,81 --> 00:13:29,11
that we went there in this rented house

185
00:13:30,08 --> 00:13:31,52
and i can remember my mother saying

186
00:13:31,52 --> 00:13:36,54
that she was worried because
we had very little food and

187
00:13:36,54 --> 00:13:39,33
that the children didn't have any milk.

188
00:13:39,35 --> 00:13:42,04
So my brother jack is bagging blish went

189
00:13:42,04 --> 00:13:45,23
and i thought like a family could we
have some milk and maybe give us some

190
00:13:46,02 --> 00:13:49,61
and he offered to pay but he said i
don't worry i know how hard it is

191
00:13:49,61 --> 00:13:54,74
and we having it hard to separate the dairy
farmers were really having a hard time

192
00:13:54,74 --> 00:13:59,95
too. You know and it must
have been do you really.

193
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,82
Then the much about that period of
time when you and who are years of age

194
00:14:03,82 --> 00:14:05,14
and coming to a new country.

195
00:14:05,45 --> 00:14:09,24
Well i can i can remember from
there on a fair bit getting it.

196
00:14:09,24 --> 00:14:12,83
I can remember.

197
00:14:12,84 --> 00:14:14,34
My brother

198
00:14:14,35 --> 00:14:20,15
and my father dragging all the materials
to build a house up a steep hill behind a

199
00:14:20,15 --> 00:14:24,96
horse because there was no road
to where the bananas were so.

200
00:14:25,40 --> 00:14:28,81
Tough and our body totally on would have
been put on the slide and dragged up

201
00:14:28,81 --> 00:14:35,59
and all that you built this house
but with the help of friends.

202
00:14:35,86 --> 00:14:39,91
He was a man from their home town. Yes.

203
00:14:39,99 --> 00:14:43,14
He helped them build in
italy in italy for that

204
00:14:43,14 --> 00:14:47,40
and tell you in time they'd met quite a few
other italians i would like would have

205
00:14:47,40 --> 00:14:53,06
meditating and yes we could but try
and keep contact with the retaliation

206
00:14:53,88 --> 00:14:57,69
that this man from your father's home
town city come out after your father

207
00:14:57,69 --> 00:15:01,21
or oh i can't tell you i really can't say

208
00:15:01,21 --> 00:15:05,61
but now i believe he would have come out
early because he was a young man too.

209
00:15:06,58 --> 00:15:09,70
So that must have been good for your
father to meet someone from his own home.

210
00:15:09,84 --> 00:15:12,73
Oh yes yes i'd say that
they would be yeah.

211
00:15:12,79 --> 00:15:17,35
Would he have known him before he left us.
I think i probably would have from you.

212
00:15:17,35 --> 00:15:22,68
Same 10 years because. The home town. Sort
of like the nella bahrain in miniature.

213
00:15:22,87 --> 00:15:25,97
You know. And yes they would have
known now that grand i'd be doing.

214
00:15:26,10 --> 00:15:27,31
You wouldn't you know everyone

215
00:15:27,31 --> 00:15:31,63
but they didn't then you know everyone
you know everyone. Yes certainly.

216
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:37,33
Then they actually hadn't
had built a house. And.

217
00:15:37,97 --> 00:15:44,25
A senate that was built. We moved them.
By this time. Describe the house again.

218
00:15:44,45 --> 00:15:45,57
Describe the house.

219
00:15:45,64 --> 00:15:49,67
I think this thing where all the house was
made of boards no chance of boards like

220
00:15:49,67 --> 00:15:52,61
they have they were just pine boards

221
00:15:52,61 --> 00:15:54,78
and which you were able
at one top of the other.

222
00:15:54,80 --> 00:15:58,08
So the rain wouldn't come
in there was no lining.

223
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,50
And of course there's no ceiling

224
00:16:03,06 --> 00:16:09,36
and we had one tank which was not attached
to the house it was we had to carry the

225
00:16:09,36 --> 00:16:13,37
water. To the kitchen and into
the bathroom and everything.

226
00:16:14,60 --> 00:16:18,38
I think it was because the tank
had to be lower than the house.

227
00:16:18,41 --> 00:16:20,84
I imagine otherwise it wouldn't
have caught the water.

228
00:16:22,17 --> 00:16:26,85
So we had to actually carry all the water
into the house for a lot of money.

229
00:16:26,87 --> 00:16:32,15
And hot water column ejecting. You hand.

230
00:16:33,72 --> 00:16:35,19
That's really a joke better really.

231
00:16:37,93 --> 00:16:40,80
Rena with a many rooms in the house

232
00:16:40,80 --> 00:16:44,29
that you lived in while it would
have three rooms one command

233
00:16:44,29 --> 00:16:47,85
and one for the girls and one
for the boys and the miranda.

234
00:16:47,87 --> 00:16:51,91
So there were not actually a living
room with there is no no no.

235
00:16:51,93 --> 00:16:56,05
To get a kitchen and a small
room that we call the bathroom

236
00:16:56,05 --> 00:17:01,15
but they didn't have anything in it or
we had was a wash tub and emus the tub

237
00:17:01,15 --> 00:17:02,69
and we parted the water

238
00:17:02,69 --> 00:17:07,03
and kind of the water had something more
to probably on the wouldn't stay with it

239
00:17:07,03 --> 00:17:12,51
it wouldn't stay. Later on when my
brother got married he took the bedrooms

240
00:17:12,51 --> 00:17:16,34
and the boys slept in the room that
was at the very end the crisis in

241
00:17:16,34 --> 00:17:22,62
or it will been closed in on to start i
wouldn't have been made into a room it

242
00:17:22,62 --> 00:17:25,74
wasn't my into a room and the
kitchen with the kids in the house

243
00:17:25,74 --> 00:17:29,30
or was it outside when i was in the
house and to stay within the house

244
00:17:29,30 --> 00:17:35,81
and with a tin type place they had
a very neat way of making me clean

245
00:17:35,82 --> 00:17:36,58
fireplaces.

246
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:42,54
Well i had a tin fireplace for a long
long time even after i was married.

247
00:17:45,02 --> 00:17:48,86
And there was plenty of mood of
course. So that that was no problem.

248
00:17:50,54 --> 00:17:53,12
But i can remember one
day my mother telling me

249
00:17:53,12 --> 00:17:59,29
that she was telling me i actually
remember i had a pain under my arm was so.

250
00:18:00,77 --> 00:18:03,39
And i've never been a whinge i carry

251
00:18:03,39 --> 00:18:06,10
and so i didn't say
anything for a long time

252
00:18:07,17 --> 00:18:10,63
and then one day i felt something
under my arm so i write to my mother

253
00:18:10,63 --> 00:18:14,03
and i said look for it
and it was a huge kick

254
00:18:15,83 --> 00:18:17,86
and so she panicked say she grabbed me

255
00:18:17,86 --> 00:18:22,65
and we raced over to where my
brother was in the fairway

256
00:18:23,74 --> 00:18:26,14
and she showed him what i had
because she didn't know what it was

257
00:18:26,99 --> 00:18:28,06
and so he just gave a laugh

258
00:18:28,06 --> 00:18:32,05
and said i don't worry just pull it out me
just pull it out at me with a lot of it

259
00:18:32,05 --> 00:18:33,28
was so. So bloated.

260
00:18:33,62 --> 00:18:37,37
Luckily it was a model take a
look at had been a cattle sheep

261
00:18:37,37 --> 00:18:38,47
that would have been really dangerous.

262
00:18:39,02 --> 00:18:44,47
But i can still remember how scared
mum was and then she had me scared by

263
00:18:44,47 --> 00:18:47,36
and into my time she would never
have come across anything

264
00:18:47,36 --> 00:18:49,25
and i think nothing like it you know

265
00:18:49,25 --> 00:18:52,42
and she didn't know what she probably
thought it was some australian surf

266
00:18:52,42 --> 00:18:54,33
and something.

267
00:18:54,35 --> 00:18:58,18
How did your mother cope with you know
the critters that we have in australia

268
00:18:58,18 --> 00:18:58,79
and

269
00:18:58,79 --> 00:19:05,31
that would have been such a different
seriously are you cited in the snakes

270
00:19:05,31 --> 00:19:09,44
and i don't remember a lot about that.

271
00:19:09,52 --> 00:19:12,18
I know there were some that
that is around at the time

272
00:19:13,79 --> 00:19:17,21
and i can remember one time
that killed about that up

273
00:19:17,21 --> 00:19:20,86
and i used to like to annoy my
brother kazoo you saw your dog me.

274
00:19:22,26 --> 00:19:26,13
So i got the death and i
rangers if it happened to us

275
00:19:26,13 --> 00:19:32,60
and their mother was
safe and. Do they have.

276
00:19:34,17 --> 00:19:37,01
What do they have an easily
in that they do have.

277
00:19:37,36 --> 00:19:39,37
But they have no snakes in a viper.

278
00:19:39,47 --> 00:19:40,02
I think

279
00:19:41,77 --> 00:19:46,19
and the sight of your own country may be a
lot much more than what i thought there

280
00:19:46,19 --> 00:19:48,22
was a lot of insiders today.

281
00:19:48,39 --> 00:19:51,81
Well they probably would have
been so it was an altogether.

282
00:19:52,12 --> 00:19:57,06
You know you know not a lot of her you
know the snakes i think which would have

283
00:19:57,06 --> 00:19:59,93
been but i never heard of saying.

284
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,20
Not about the snakes you
know all i mean with that

285
00:20:02,20 --> 00:20:07,25
that as a man it would mean
to me and if he did you know.

286
00:20:08,03 --> 00:20:11,26
I mean you you little say you
grew up here acclimatised

287
00:20:11,26 --> 00:20:13,20
but how do you know i never heard them.

288
00:20:13,26 --> 00:20:15,15
They never complain i don't
think they complain.

289
00:20:15,18 --> 00:20:18,02
I think that life was so much easier here.

290
00:20:18,41 --> 00:20:24,20
Life is so much easier for the poor people
in australia because they don't have

291
00:20:24,20 --> 00:20:25,56
time or clothes i.

292
00:20:25,64 --> 00:20:29,14
Yeah yeah i mean just imagine
what price clothes that

293
00:20:30,16 --> 00:20:34,23
and i don't think any of us actually had
shoes until we came to australia we always

294
00:20:34,23 --> 00:20:35,18
wore wouldn't clogs.

295
00:20:36,82 --> 00:20:40,96
In my family used to make a lot of
those i still have the implements

296
00:20:40,96 --> 00:20:45,66
that he made them with i don't know how i
inherited those are probably asking for

297
00:20:45,66 --> 00:20:46,87
no one else and interested.

298
00:20:47,12 --> 00:20:51,83
He wasn't very good at it i might add that
he even made fun here in australia. Yes.

299
00:20:52,03 --> 00:20:56,28
So they all would have had
clogs with all them but my

300
00:20:56,28 --> 00:21:00,44
when we arrived here we were all dressed
very neatly mother was a very proud woman

301
00:21:00,44 --> 00:21:03,08
and she was a good dressmaker.
She made all your clothes.

302
00:21:03,30 --> 00:21:06,95
Oh you risk your lives you know close
what kind of guys did she wear.

303
00:21:08,53 --> 00:21:11,94
Well i dress a voter all
dressed in a beautiful red.

304
00:21:12,04 --> 00:21:16,64
I don't know if you made it
or we were all lately dressed

305
00:21:16,64 --> 00:21:18,06
when we come you know the boys.

306
00:21:19,70 --> 00:21:21,18
I can say a favour of it later

307
00:21:22,67 --> 00:21:27,80
and we all know except for my kids
sister emma who i'd say much.

308
00:21:27,84 --> 00:21:32,13
On the way out of all this she'd never
seen she put on so much weight she looks

309
00:21:32,13 --> 00:21:35,05
bloated and she was always to the right.

310
00:21:35,27 --> 00:21:40,15
I can't even remember a fact
said she lost it straight away.

311
00:21:40,17 --> 00:21:42,18
So she didn't fit in there is no.

312
00:21:42,47 --> 00:21:45,70
So you can see it stretching on it
you know i mean photo that we took

313
00:21:45,70 --> 00:21:47,32
that photo would have been taken.

314
00:21:47,43 --> 00:21:51,49
Probably the day we ride or
else you know come to this.

315
00:21:51,63 --> 00:21:55,74
I forgot to ask you a very important
question earlier you know what you made in a

316
00:21:56,59 --> 00:21:59,16
car that was bold van something you had.

317
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:02,25
They are evolve that i am in

318
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:08,63
and where you live with their many italians
in the community the word a really lot

319
00:22:08,63 --> 00:22:13,75
of italians here at the time because we
were in the second family have a family who

320
00:22:13,75 --> 00:22:18,32
came to lismore the first one was bad
that they had come to years earlier.

321
00:22:20,17 --> 00:22:27,17
We actually all through my life here
in the family like we have not had a

322
00:22:27,17 --> 00:22:31,38
close knit italian community where sort
of been because our bananas were further

323
00:22:31,38 --> 00:22:36,29
away we sort of haven't had a lot
of governing bling with italians.

324
00:22:36,38 --> 00:22:41,52
Did you have did you have close
neighbors when we first went up there.

325
00:22:41,63 --> 00:22:48,35
No we didn't have those neighbors later
on there wasn't another italian family

326
00:22:48,35 --> 00:22:53,98
became you know what was going on and
they're interesting and have my niece

327
00:22:53,98 --> 00:22:59,34
and now marry one of theirs. You know
on sunday but not very far away.

328
00:22:59,46 --> 00:23:01,80
There was a row that
came out onto jinggoy.

329
00:23:03,43 --> 00:23:08,01
And there was a local carrier there clarrie
garbage who used to take the bananas.

330
00:23:08,92 --> 00:23:12,72
But that didn't come to light all its own
like a member there were any australians.

331
00:23:13,35 --> 00:23:19,56
There were straying and what kind of food.
Did your mother call for the family.

332
00:23:19,59 --> 00:23:24,65
Well i'm sure i just don't remember
the first day but my brother

333
00:23:24,65 --> 00:23:29,97
and my father would have had a vegetable
garden going i'm sure some thought they

334
00:23:29,97 --> 00:23:36,16
would have had some chalks and so we
would have very little meat as such

335
00:23:36,16 --> 00:23:42,54
but we would have had chicken and. We
would have had the eggs and chickens.

336
00:23:43,91 --> 00:23:46,85
We would have made soup out of
the old hymns i mean nothing.

337
00:23:47,00 --> 00:23:50,42
Wasted and then the same

338
00:23:50,42 --> 00:23:54,81
that could happen remember this is you know
they could have all the kale within my

339
00:23:54,81 --> 00:23:59,13
life so much simpler for us because
the care was really a lifeline with

340
00:23:59,14 --> 00:24:02,49
that inexpensive. Well probably
would have been at the time

341
00:24:02,49 --> 00:24:06,89
but my brother having gone to ingham he
wouldn't they would've got a little bit of

342
00:24:06,89 --> 00:24:08,37
money that way and he's coming coming.

343
00:24:09,26 --> 00:24:11,90
I say that's how they paid for
the timber for the house.

344
00:24:12,87 --> 00:24:14,49
And it's a moneymaker and strange.

345
00:24:14,62 --> 00:24:16,94
Oh yes yes then

346
00:24:16,94 --> 00:24:23,19
and there was a barter of course what they
did was put them milk in a large dish

347
00:24:23,19 --> 00:24:26,45
or two depending on how
much was needed and

348
00:24:26,46 --> 00:24:30,44
when the queen kind of talk you would
skim some of the cream off but not all of

349
00:24:31,42 --> 00:24:32,56
that was made into butter.

350
00:24:34,26 --> 00:24:39,37
Then we would make the cheese
and up and that was made.

351
00:24:40,17 --> 00:24:45,63
What was left was made into a
record of cheese and then what was

352
00:24:45,63 --> 00:24:47,78
that left there was spent on the pig.

353
00:24:49,12 --> 00:24:52,87
So that it cow was really
very important items

354
00:24:54,64 --> 00:24:59,77
and we had we have another thing
that we did have with beans.

355
00:24:59,88 --> 00:25:05,38
You know call them the dried seed you
know you have the pinto beans you have a

356
00:25:05,38 --> 00:25:09,21
kidney means you have so
much. You know. It's so.

357
00:25:09,22 --> 00:25:12,27
I don't know what kind they were
actually i think there will be a meeting

358
00:25:13,26 --> 00:25:16,32
and we plant a good time we have
pressure it is fresh vegetables

359
00:25:16,32 --> 00:25:20,15
and the rest will have to
go to seed with this seed

360
00:25:21,60 --> 00:25:25,57
that would last all year then
so it would be soaked overnight

361
00:25:26,73 --> 00:25:31,47
and in the morning it will be cooked some
of some of the beans will be within the

362
00:25:31,47 --> 00:25:36,19
salad and the rest would be mashed
up and made in the minestrone soup.

363
00:25:37,39 --> 00:25:39,66
So that with the beans and the vegetables

364
00:25:39,66 --> 00:25:43,86
that we grew it was really a tasty meal

365
00:25:43,87 --> 00:25:47,40
and also full of biedermann
much needed by them and. Yes.

366
00:25:47,43 --> 00:25:52,75
Did your mother make pasta dish attitude
like oh yes we had a spaghetti machine

367
00:25:53,54 --> 00:25:56,73
which isn't like the ones i have now.
It actually turned out brown spaghetti.

368
00:25:56,87 --> 00:26:00,57
My sister and her and that. Do you think.

369
00:26:00,63 --> 00:26:05,18
No no i think i have made makes
me think you know she doesn't.

370
00:26:06,20 --> 00:26:11,82
So she wouldn't really and we also made
our own bread and to make the bread

371
00:26:11,82 --> 00:26:16,98
and i think in the beginning
they used to make it out.

372
00:26:18,36 --> 00:26:25,38
When they killed a calf if you get
something like make a turn it into junket.

373
00:26:26,19 --> 00:26:29,44
I should know more about that but
i think he had some time ago

374
00:26:31,23 --> 00:26:39,05
but i thought it seems they want to normal
day what would you have to breakfast.

375
00:26:42,75 --> 00:26:49,25
Probably great wouldn't have any
cereal probably bread which

376
00:26:49,26 --> 00:26:52,12
not it would make them angry
that here they did not use.

377
00:26:52,31 --> 00:26:53,87
Yeah but that wouldn't happen

378
00:26:53,87 --> 00:26:58,95
but with what we had to do which
annoyed me the key was that when

379
00:26:58,95 --> 00:27:02,09
that i was ready to need
having we would be family

380
00:27:02,09 --> 00:27:05,80
and we used to probably only make it
every two or three days. You know.

381
00:27:06,61 --> 00:27:13,08
So we had a board. Two feet square
and on that one end would be.

382
00:27:13,58 --> 00:27:19,23
Two pieces of wood with about through
them and also through a long handle

383
00:27:20,13 --> 00:27:22,65
and it took two people one
person would turn the dow up

384
00:27:22,65 --> 00:27:25,00
and one person would go up

385
00:27:25,00 --> 00:27:29,24
and down with the handle whosoever were
pushing the bag down and they handle kind.

386
00:27:30,56 --> 00:27:34,75
It would needed and i that was my job
with that handle and i like that

387
00:27:34,75 --> 00:27:35,99
and it would have been a hard.

388
00:27:36,12 --> 00:27:41,49
It wasn't hard work but just annoyed me
and i don't know why i just hated it

389
00:27:41,49 --> 00:27:46,63
but if we actually i don't know why i think
i did it was probably later on because

390
00:27:46,63 --> 00:27:49,11
i wouldn't do that when
i was very young or

391
00:27:49,11 --> 00:27:54,73
that we had to take home my bread to school
and i wanted to be like everybody else.

392
00:27:54,76 --> 00:27:59,77
I hated that i might break. And yet
in summer. Melt with absolutely.

393
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,27
Before wasn't there holding them but
i really like about homemade bread.

394
00:28:04,46 --> 00:28:05,92
So that's what you took to school.

395
00:28:05,98 --> 00:28:08,94
Oh yes that's what we had
we used to buy the cheese

396
00:28:08,94 --> 00:28:15,20
that the flour in corn bags i mean how
much they held a sugar always came in 70

397
00:28:15,20 --> 00:28:16,72
pound bags. You know.

398
00:28:17,39 --> 00:28:21,47
Because you have that have to be
brought up by the carrier and go on

399
00:28:21,47 --> 00:28:24,63
and picked up with a slide and took
to the house the moment things.

400
00:28:24,72 --> 00:28:30,26
What did you have a cigarette. If
you have a program to be salami.

401
00:28:30,48 --> 00:28:36,06
But i think you know we had better i can't
actually remember you know a cereal

402
00:28:36,06 --> 00:28:39,59
dream coming to a long long time and
i don't think we might have made.

403
00:28:39,82 --> 00:28:45,79
I think mum made a subpar image out.

404
00:28:45,81 --> 00:28:46,86
Out of.

405
00:28:48,16 --> 00:28:53,37
We now call it similar enough that we
haven't different name before breakfast.

406
00:28:53,66 --> 00:28:55,47
A lot. That's what they used to call it.

407
00:28:56,20 --> 00:28:57,59
Yeah well she knew all about

408
00:28:57,59 --> 00:29:02,53
that because it was very much like the
what they used to make polenta with any

409
00:29:02,53 --> 00:29:07,03
bling. So we i think refered allotments

410
00:29:07,03 --> 00:29:09,75
and you know it would have
been a lot on the mean so

411
00:29:09,75 --> 00:29:15,76
that was like the spongy some
substance. Yes just a lot.

412
00:29:15,79 --> 00:29:16,92
Yes yes.

413
00:29:17,87 --> 00:29:22,94
And if you wanted to turn it into polenta
just made it hard for mental well also

414
00:29:22,94 --> 00:29:25,72
something that was digitised coming.

415
00:29:27,25 --> 00:29:29,27
You know we didn't and i
think we used to eat fresh.

416
00:29:29,65 --> 00:29:34,35
You know when you make people making
the bridges making up so it takes two

417
00:29:34,35 --> 00:29:38,78
or three well at least two days you know
you know i would it would stay fresh an

418
00:29:38,78 --> 00:29:40,30
old. Oh yes and all year.

419
00:29:40,47 --> 00:29:43,77
If we did what facilities did you
have in the house for keeping.

420
00:29:45,92 --> 00:29:49,56
Well i don't remember i think the bread
box was made out of wood out of boards

421
00:29:49,56 --> 00:29:54,36
that was a breed dogs must have been hard
to keep you didn't have a lot of meat

422
00:29:54,36 --> 00:30:00,56
that you know well in milk and well
the milk would have. I'm fresh sea.

423
00:30:00,66 --> 00:30:03,81
Every day day i'd say they would
have probably got another care after

424
00:30:03,81 --> 00:30:09,66
and since they could do no good have
been praised there was no meat i can't

425
00:30:09,66 --> 00:30:14,17
remember meat when we lived up on top
of gee guys going to ali they called me

426
00:30:14,17 --> 00:30:16,99
and she can cook and the chicken
would have been cooked.

427
00:30:17,17 --> 00:30:20,21
Yeah so that wasn't
really any problem there.

428
00:30:20,29 --> 00:30:24,75
Although we had learnt from the australians
to keep the barrack room used to put an

429
00:30:24,75 --> 00:30:31,20
estate agent team with or hole in the new
put it with a bag over the top of that

430
00:30:31,20 --> 00:30:35,44
and convert them and then keep them
but there were no other animals.

431
00:30:35,53 --> 00:30:38,60
Actually no we didn't have anything though

432
00:30:40,23 --> 00:30:44,62
that what we did with the butter to make
it last was to actually turn it in what

433
00:30:44,62 --> 00:30:50,85
they call now jean. We will make them see
when the strain. They don't know what to.

434
00:30:50,87 --> 00:30:52,89
Moment would keep.

435
00:30:52,91 --> 00:30:56,89
Did you have to apart from helping with
the great if you have to help your mother

436
00:30:56,89 --> 00:31:00,14
with the chills and the
cooking. Not a lot actually.

437
00:31:00,28 --> 00:31:02,83
Because i've been the youngest
one i really didn't help much.

438
00:31:02,89 --> 00:31:04,13
Not at that time anyway.

439
00:31:04,26 --> 00:31:05,47
If you're older brothers

440
00:31:05,47 --> 00:31:09,08
and sisters have their children
to do they would have had some

441
00:31:09,08 --> 00:31:14,22
but i mean the sisters of the house was
so small telegram lee wasn't a lot

442
00:31:14,22 --> 00:31:17,15
but they did help in the
farm as i got older

443
00:31:17,15 --> 00:31:21,63
and they had to chip grass because there
was no spraying then we didn't have any

444
00:31:21,63 --> 00:31:27,22
strife at all at all had to be done by hand
and also we planned and beans and peas.

445
00:31:28,57 --> 00:31:33,12
So i would have had to help there.
You know and as i did later on.

446
00:31:33,35 --> 00:31:34,37
But not at that time.

447
00:31:36,27 --> 00:31:40,28
When and where was the school that you
went to hell when you went out of school.

448
00:31:40,30 --> 00:31:43,78
I think i would have been about six
and when i first started school.

449
00:31:45,19 --> 00:31:50,75
The people that my brother knew
parmenter let me write it down below

450
00:31:50,75 --> 00:31:54,05
and mccarthy camp but given the high horse

451
00:31:54,05 --> 00:31:57,53
and i'll never forget it
because it had clubbed feet.

452
00:31:57,65 --> 00:31:59,86
The only horse i've ever seen my lovelies.
