1
00:00:38,98 --> 00:03:11,02
You know your comedy club is really very good you know because of the year. Well there. All right yes.

2
00:04:04,63 --> 00:04:15,4
Life there which he had grabbed Giles that we can't miss.

3
00:04:15,41 --> 00:04:53,53
Now having just come through very well that you are in the hospital. He's got to please you.

4
00:04:53,55 --> 00:09:53,1
I'm going to be true that Russia will likely die that Iraq raised a lot of stories she live. Oh you're right. Will you.

5
00:10:29,76 --> 00:14:06,61
Thank you guys really. You know really really really what is it. So over the next I'll say just about everybody else.

6
00:14:06,69 --> 00:14:19,61
I really think you love me and she really loves a lot of your. Love.

7
00:14:19,61 --> 00:14:40,22
It was never serious in your marriage for which it was the only thing that will give you another neighbor boys like you

8
00:14:40,22 --> 00:14:53,46
for a week if you really want to get a very strong. That's what it is not ever.

9
00:14:53,47 --> 00:15:26,41
OK but still she really does feel that something that you really noises in the right time

10
00:15:26,41 --> 00:15:57,27
and work you said you can check that she doesn't hear more and more subtly talk about great actually.

11
00:16:09,66 --> 00:17:34,78
Right right right. It was it was a tree in her collar treat each other very.

12
00:18:04,02 --> 00:18:04,72
He was doing

13
00:18:04,72 --> 00:18:16,76
and he's not he's not saying that that's not the problem with this is what it was actually his sexual problem what is

14
00:18:16,76 --> 00:18:39,29
your very the other issue with your life do you hear the rights read making that the law ending with a very early one

15
00:18:46,86 --> 00:18:47,81
yet something goes wrong

16
00:18:47,81 --> 00:18:55,82
when you're an adolescent you have here in my brain to your right by what we saw here is the best way of getting the

17
00:18:55,82 --> 00:19:00,07
heaviest Philip She's cancer of I don't much like her liver.

18
00:19:00,37 --> 00:19:14,57
I can tell there are no it's not the person not homesick for just me but you can't really use the word.

19
00:19:16,17 --> 00:19:29,61
So maybe it doesn't look like there's only one great fight for the right card for the American military that it's nuns

20
00:19:29,61 --> 00:19:45,11
who have to look I'm not on the brink of the problem if you want to get that right religion repression thing you can

21
00:19:45,11 --> 00:19:48,01
just imagine for a lot of the people in the priesthood. You know.

22
00:19:48,07 --> 00:20:00,41
Yeah it just must be restored with religion with religion when you're fired.

23
00:20:01,28 --> 00:20:06,72
That was actually probably correlated with his religion.

24
00:20:08,12 --> 00:20:15,48
Well it's certainly one that interferes with people for the good of the game in the future.

25
00:20:26,29 --> 00:20:40,42
Can get intentionally physically repressed because of their religion to get married.

26
00:20:40,67 --> 00:20:45,66
That would be happy but something here.

27
00:20:45,7 --> 00:21:08,47
You know that really is a really good little playground area that was the worst thing in the early sixty's

28
00:21:08,47 --> 00:21:27,14
when we get involved in the art of one of the you know you'd rather not hear somebody say I don't think there was also

29
00:21:27,14 --> 00:21:48,92
a lot of right wing there's been a whole much a whole very what they call it that was I think that still sits in

30
00:21:48,92 --> 00:21:55,58
history books and they fit in. Yes but not this thing.

31
00:21:55,6 --> 00:22:10,76
It is really you get to the ground I think a lot of it has to do with. The idea of this very old.

32
00:22:10,76 --> 00:22:15,49
It was through the go through there will always be white paint.

33
00:22:18,72 --> 00:22:35,07
Oh you're very good at the word you just casual and Jane

34
00:22:35,07 --> 00:22:50,47
and very charming some of the last of those down to the store was that it was true that it is there a whole other thing

35
00:22:50,47 --> 00:22:51,32
very good.

36
00:22:51,49 --> 00:23:20,69
You know you know you can raise you know the minority likely to get what you must remember of course the very least you

37
00:23:20,69 --> 00:23:34,57
know what's right for one where there's a woman called

38
00:23:34,57 --> 00:24:00,58
and I was pretty rough with very very pretty girl another woman who was off this morning and there.

39
00:24:01,86 --> 00:24:08,91
Really proving that you know like the old boys in the band having to put down the street here

40
00:24:09,21 --> 00:24:12,54
and that's the only means anybody get from my model

41
00:24:12,81 --> 00:24:36,58
and I know that's what you say lot of people say you have to report the love of life that she does things in the right

42
00:24:36,58 --> 00:24:36,86
place

43
00:24:37,11 --> 00:24:47,37
and all that harry want to manage the me you know only She's here with us here always sitting in front of the was someone

44
00:24:47,82 --> 00:24:54,42
we'd listen to us on that really.

45
00:24:55,4 --> 00:25:03,57
So actually run into people that said that she really said yeah it probably is for six three folks

46
00:25:03,57 --> 00:25:25,39
but the big draw for her was well I'd say that's original so I said yeah get it done just continue like you know you

47
00:25:26,11 --> 00:25:42,66
are doing a lot of those where you know you have as you say very little if anything of the voice of it until I do.

48
00:25:44,32 --> 00:25:55,19
Oh it will come to love that you can't come until you love to do you know you know like the cross.

49
00:25:55,33 --> 00:25:58,96
I mean there is one character in a voice. Don't bother to cowbell.

50
00:26:03,13 --> 00:26:35,92
Always we go with this which is very tempting to my friends who live there.

51
00:26:59,35 --> 00:28:11,54
Because believe me there was very little she was married to a child she said to me. Cruel and she doesn't get it.

52
00:28:12,02 --> 00:29:56,97
But she has very well I mean she really called it a ranch to get. You know.

53
00:30:01,49 --> 00:30:12,65
For those who cover all the part that we kill you or anybody that gets me child.

54
00:30:13,11 --> 00:30:26,77
They are killed and that running will come recently killing everybody right all right.

55
00:30:28,5 --> 00:30:39,34
Here she looks like she was allowed to tell you and all. Oh there you go there was one heterosexual so full of life.

56
00:30:39,41 --> 00:30:58,79
You were trying to say oh it is a thing. There was no life changing event it was something.

57
00:30:58,91 --> 00:31:20,2
Oh yes she was one of the friends I could love life from obviously not cool as it probably will leave me access to the

58
00:31:20,2 --> 00:31:31,33
young so it was just talking to me had the looks are used to have those in a big car like they can get by me like a

59
00:31:31,33 --> 00:32:14,02
trail very vicious cycle on trying to look back in the days to be happy. She said. Oh she's like she didn't want to.

60
00:32:14,02 --> 00:32:20,02
Yeah kill an American car.

61
00:32:20,12 --> 00:32:33,00
Recently she does not come here to think of something must be wrong

62
00:32:33,00 --> 00:32:52,03
or what kind of a lot of people simply that's why you might find character traits.

63
00:32:52,1 --> 00:33:22,34
So it was OK Well that's what we have come to copulate you think that Henry Morris case that was a real character

64
00:33:22,34 --> 00:33:27,81
actually cheering. That's right.

65
00:33:27,96 --> 00:33:52,01
The nation's sixty Minutes really over an area you mention that my readers want to get that's right.

66
00:33:52,12 --> 00:33:58,08
Good from here with partnership.

67
00:34:06,1 --> 00:34:11,23
Well we fought for the physical because if you have a quick look through just to check out.

68
00:34:12,2 --> 00:34:26,92
I mean one of these you got much out of it. It's likely he will be here for the next one.

69
00:34:26,95 --> 00:35:36,2
And that was the goal because he doesn't you know you're going to come here with a little memory and have a chance

70
00:35:36,2 --> 00:35:58,28
and their families were having a great deal of working to get very middle class.

71
00:36:02,02 --> 00:36:27,04
So basically you don't know what you know Jack what do you drive to work

72
00:36:31,73 --> 00:37:14,68
and I really like the newsmen like anything was going on and that you was going to go on like.

73
00:37:16,05 --> 00:38:35,35
Good morning to you know he's been the shop where you go where the shop. Oh. I can't hear you. Yes Well you know.

74
00:38:53,79 --> 00:40:19,3
Yes Thank you Farai. Yes I mean it was a lot of fun. Yeah.

75
00:40:31,26 --> 00:43:22,55
Like a like you just reading about me like yeah that was just very kewl. Yeah I mean right now.

76
00:44:09,15 --> 00:44:49,17
I mean we can probably get dragged such a great deal with it all you know you know

77
00:44:49,42 --> 00:45:37,35
and well I was actually in that actual thing you with your friends. Yeah that was really really very much go.

78
00:45:40,14 --> 00:46:00,39
Really really really guilty when everybody said they can't really get a love story of the century right.

79
00:46:03,39 --> 00:46:58,52
You know what you want to really do you think of a certain tell a story from the same pretend relationships which are

80
00:46:58,52 --> 00:47:16,51
going to become you which will break up and you're out almost like oh I see people getting a lawyer.

81
00:47:16,61 --> 00:47:28,7
It's wrong to be really critical of the look you know when you seriously go into this thing again and again

82
00:47:28,7 --> 00:47:31,18
and again and seriously say I love you I love you.

83
00:47:31,18 --> 00:47:51,17
Let's let it be for ever for me for the same person you don't sleep with me.

84
00:48:02,58 --> 00:49:01,68
Well you hear what it was my brother was this was about the big trial.

85
00:49:05,5 --> 00:49:14,91
The whole game was getting you guys to do it all. Why do you sound like you Michael.

86
00:49:14,92 --> 00:49:41,01
These guys really are closer to God The battle for Libya was really well it's probably one of the race card

87
00:49:41,01 --> 00:50:20,13
and it was a one world. No more than. Really she was really really good.

88
00:50:20,3 --> 00:50:29,38
Yeah I mean you know the more you know for many years three years ago.

89
00:50:29,48 --> 00:50:41,94
I mean sometimes I get very very rigidly right you was just relying on each of us really you know you know because you

90
00:50:41,94 --> 00:51:02,47
know when you look at the problems you didn't want me to get you. They'll just get that relationship.

91
00:51:02,52 --> 00:51:59,3
It's really it's really probably my goal of getting to be what about you have to do the interview because you're the

92
00:51:59,3 --> 00:51:59,4
one.

93
00:52:01,27 --> 00:53:25,41
Just don't really see this right because that's what they're meant to know if you really are

94
00:53:28,22 --> 00:53:58,06
and what's the point of why you do that then you will see that you don't really read it sometime.

95
00:54:04,07 --> 00:54:26,03
I mean he was just saying he was was a find me at least for me for knowing you're in that sort of place.

96
00:54:26,4 --> 00:54:36,51
Let me just say you know what you guys done the bar was really coming from probably majority will I mean there was

97
00:54:36,51 --> 00:55:02,77
something you would never hear about the sexual total sexual fall because you know that's part of that there's a whole

98
00:55:02,77 --> 00:55:28,08
range of people who you look like that you know the main story.

99
00:55:29,73 --> 00:56:01,01
The successes or the you know if you pay say everybody else really well I'm not sure. Thank you for wanting to.

100
00:56:02,48 --> 00:56:08,23
Yeah man I like such as you are you know like that.

101
00:56:08,26 --> 00:56:11,11
Mike you know that someone has all this character in such

102
00:56:11,11 --> 00:56:20,63
and such a silence you sitting there with their lives on the sidewalk.

103
00:56:20,66 --> 00:56:26,53
You know reading all about striking the right guy writing this book

104
00:56:26,53 --> 00:56:39,08
but you want to carry on this story you want to experience we want to use the fact that it's not like that's some of

105
00:56:39,08 --> 00:56:48,4
the rest some really really really you know yes the whole of people read that book but if you know that

106
00:56:48,4 --> 00:56:56,69
or even if they start really it's quite clear. Yeah yeah but he doesn't like it on the lot.

107
00:56:56,84 --> 00:57:12,49
There was this hard to do anything yet tongue wheel that the others we get a lot of time in this book really the way we

108
00:57:12,49 --> 00:57:17,16
actually you know like almost like a like

109
00:57:17,16 --> 00:57:25,99
but I mean it's very not just your way which is something quite similar to the way in which the you know the extent to

110
00:57:25,99 --> 00:57:36,13
which people worry about me will slip right before that I was not quite wrong

111
00:57:36,13 --> 00:57:57,61
or you mean I didn't have to identify the way in which the end of the. They were I think things like that Russia might.

112
00:58:03,29 --> 00:58:09,74
Three one son one.

113
00:58:14,48 --> 00:58:19,03
Well I did I hear somebody say the real something

114
00:58:19,44 --> 00:58:31,92
and it was the head the whole lot of stuff about us in our living which led to the movie I remember very clearly

115
00:58:31,92 --> 00:58:34,45
because I got the bloody caution.

116
00:58:34,74 --> 00:58:41,34
I didn't quite understand but I remember very well here's a question for I want to know why

117
00:58:42,46 --> 00:58:52,97
and he loves you know that my memory is infecting the concept of free.

118
00:58:53,67 --> 00:59:13,61
Let's just tell you about this thing you do to people in here. Let me tell you this. It was just really the other one.

119
00:59:13,92 --> 00:59:31,21
It still is really somebody will try to get some you don't tip here because you have to really get a look.

120
00:59:31,27 --> 00:59:58,58
Because it wasn't just yes it was my yes yes yes it does change me just now that I knew it was because I would be

121
00:59:58,58 --> 00:59:58,92
and I.

122
01:00:03,73 --> 01:00:57,28
Yes You know it was not that there was no censorship in the group because there's really a lot of life that we think

123
01:00:58,57 --> 01:01:30,3
and then we find that it goes like this is the feel like you got you never you can bet your life. Oh right.

124
01:01:30,43 --> 01:02:38,67
Well that's good. That was just here there and that was such a big deal because it is really cool right. Didn't happen.
