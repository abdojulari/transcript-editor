1
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:04,22
I'm talking to mr.

2
00:00:04,22 --> 00:00:07,41
Charles brown who worked
in the lights workshop as

3
00:00:07,41 --> 00:00:12,64
a an apprentice boiler mirka during the
time of the building of the bridge. And he

4
00:00:12,64 --> 00:00:18,82
remember getting the job in the first
place. Mr bloom. Yes. Are you started as an

5
00:00:18,82 --> 00:00:23,00
apprentice boilermaker and feb.

6
00:00:23,79 --> 00:00:30,55
Two 1927. Actually my father
was instrumental in obtaining

7
00:00:30,56 --> 00:00:34,25
the job for me he was
anxious that i should have

8
00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:41,69
a trade. And made enquiries and
lined the job up for me i can

9
00:00:41,69 --> 00:00:48,29
still clearly remember my first day
starting in the light shop in the

10
00:00:48,29 --> 00:00:51,18
marking off section. I was only

11
00:00:51,18 --> 00:00:57,65
a little black i wore short pants and was

12
00:00:58,54 --> 00:01:05,49
after been taken into the workshop.
The charge handed joe barton. Took me

13
00:01:05,49 --> 00:01:12,21
up to another apprentice whose
name was charlie nunn and i

14
00:01:12,22 --> 00:01:16,81
started with charlie who went to

15
00:01:16,81 --> 00:01:22,53
a great deal of trouble explaining the job
itself for the tools to be used and all

16
00:01:22,53 --> 00:01:29,12
that sort of thing. It was very helpful.
I was only fifteen at the time and

17
00:01:30,29 --> 00:01:31,21
then after

18
00:01:31,21 --> 00:01:38,15
a while of course. Working with charlie
nano i then brainstorm on my own

19
00:01:39,57 --> 00:01:46,37
under the guidance of joe
barton. Mainly and later. Had

20
00:01:47,23 --> 00:01:53,15
an assistant of my own in the marking off
in that shop. Can you explain how you

21
00:01:53,15 --> 00:01:59,66
went about marking off. Well yes
the all the marking i'm sorry.

22
00:01:59,71 --> 00:02:06,71
Most of the marking was done by means of
templates that the templates came from

23
00:02:06,71 --> 00:02:13,56
the loft on top of the
workshop. The job or sections

24
00:02:13,56 --> 00:02:19,24
were laid out on the floor and
templates were taken from the

25
00:02:20,52 --> 00:02:27,07
drawings or the laying out on the
floor. They were then sent down to the.

26
00:02:27,09 --> 00:02:32,28
Marking section and they were
used in the marking we had

27
00:02:34,43 --> 00:02:41,33
a great deal of accuracy was
necessary in the marking and marking

28
00:02:41,33 --> 00:02:43,65
through the template in
the holes was by means of

29
00:02:43,65 --> 00:02:50,37
a tit punch. Then they
were lined up by means of

30
00:02:50,37 --> 00:02:53,62
a steel scriber which had

31
00:02:53,62 --> 00:02:57,57
a very thin line. Work was to

32
00:02:57,57 --> 00:03:04,53
a thirty second of an inch.
And after the. Punching

33
00:03:04,53 --> 00:03:11,28
through the template they were there no end
up with the bigger punch to locate the

34
00:03:11,28 --> 00:03:17,51
holes for the drilling. And do you mean
in the marking up over the whole of the

35
00:03:17,51 --> 00:03:24,46
time. Practically the
whole of the time. What's

36
00:03:24,46 --> 00:03:30,33
the end of my apprenticeship.
I know that i cut a hell of

37
00:03:30,33 --> 00:03:35,78
a lot of those little lattice
work that you may see on the

38
00:03:37,86 --> 00:03:41,21
sides of the road on the footpath and was

39
00:03:41,21 --> 00:03:46,84
a fairly monotonous job. Then again i cut

40
00:03:46,85 --> 00:03:51,69
a lot of those light standards or the
plate for the light standard by means of

41
00:03:51,69 --> 00:03:57,87
oxyacetylene. Apart from those
two i was in the marking section

42
00:03:58,68 --> 00:04:02,84
were all the time. Do you remember the
process right from the start of the light

43
00:04:02,84 --> 00:04:09,15
workshops through to the heavy could you
describe it for us. Yeah well. Perhaps if

44
00:04:09,15 --> 00:04:15,78
i could go back even further than that all
the steel used to come by ship and the

45
00:04:15,78 --> 00:04:21,76
silicon steel as you know came from england.
Other sections came from new castle b

46
00:04:21,76 --> 00:04:27,09
h p. They were landed on the
wharf from the. From the ship's

47
00:04:28,37 --> 00:04:32,25
plates then moved down to go through

48
00:04:32,94 --> 00:04:38,08
a main goals any plates that were distorted
or bent or buckled or went through

49
00:04:38,08 --> 00:04:42,33
there for straightening any of the
other sections that angle line or r

50
00:04:42,33 --> 00:04:45,12
e j is. Went through

51
00:04:45,12 --> 00:04:51,35
a angelo and straighten up who straightened
those they then went over into the

52
00:04:51,35 --> 00:04:58,27
bottom by of the shop. The angle to
be cut to approximate sizes in the

53
00:04:58,27 --> 00:05:04,99
angle cropper the plate
and moved over to be

54
00:05:04,99 --> 00:05:11,83
marked and cut to size in the
guillotines they were those very

55
00:05:11,83 --> 00:05:17,15
big guillotines that cut plate
eight feet wide by up to two and

56
00:05:17,15 --> 00:05:23,49
a quarter inches thickness. How they're
from there they were cut to approximate

57
00:05:23,49 --> 00:05:29,86
sizes and they moved up then into the
marking section. They were marked for

58
00:05:29,87 --> 00:05:36,48
location of holds. They then
moved up to the drills who were

59
00:05:36,48 --> 00:05:43,31
in the line in the next sequence was the
drills. They were drilled and then further

60
00:05:43,31 --> 00:05:50,16
up into the light shop was the light
assembly. They were painted with the

61
00:05:50,16 --> 00:05:56,21
red led and bolted together the

62
00:05:56,22 --> 00:06:03,05
different sections bolted together
and then they moved further

63
00:06:03,05 --> 00:06:09,35
along that shop then up to the
riveting where they were reported

64
00:06:09,35 --> 00:06:15,87
from there. That was all the
light fabrications. Then they

65
00:06:16,67 --> 00:06:22,20
went up into the heavy shop where lots
of them were joined together to make the

66
00:06:22,20 --> 00:06:27,94
huge girders and various
sections chords etc.

67
00:06:27,94 --> 00:06:34,37
That finally were taken by pont out to
underneath their location in the harbor

68
00:06:34,37 --> 00:06:40,68
under the bridge. It was the first
riveting session was done by hotel x.

69
00:06:40,68 --> 00:06:47,39
Wasn't it. Yes it. Yes they were
they were huge horseshoe shaped

70
00:06:47,39 --> 00:06:53,34
hydraulic riveting machines.
The river. Were cooked

71
00:06:54,70 --> 00:07:01,12
heated in oil fired furnaces. They were

72
00:07:01,12 --> 00:07:07,77
in quite hot they were right doubt of
that and thrown by the rivet heater to

73
00:07:09,12 --> 00:07:15,05
another to the catcher. He caught them
in half. Kara scene ten he pulled

74
00:07:15,05 --> 00:07:16,90
a mount put i'm in

75
00:07:16,90 --> 00:07:23,46
a hole the. Old or up then knocked
them in and engaged the dolly

76
00:07:23,46 --> 00:07:30,08
and of the riveting machine and the boilermaker
on the other side of course operate

77
00:07:30,08 --> 00:07:34,12
at the machine to complete the riveting and
of course when they were done up in the

78
00:07:34,12 --> 00:07:38,82
that was would take one angle so to speak
when they got to put the two sections

79
00:07:38,82 --> 00:07:39,83
together in the form of

80
00:07:39,83 --> 00:07:44,76
a box and they needed to to use pneumatic
remitting that's right. Yes that's so

81
00:07:44,76 --> 00:07:50,93
then when they have been.
Fabricated or assembled into

82
00:07:50,93 --> 00:07:57,81
a box girders it was impossible
to use the horseshoe hydraulic

83
00:07:57,81 --> 00:08:03,38
machines and the riveting and then was
done by hand. There any incidents

84
00:08:03,38 --> 00:08:07,49
particularly that you remember in the
workshops where you work. Just let me correct

85
00:08:07,49 --> 00:08:13,76
the statement i just made there about
riveting by hand hand riveting would give the

86
00:08:13,76 --> 00:08:20,55
impression to those who are knowledgeable
in the trade of using the old hammer.

87
00:08:21,74 --> 00:08:27,46
At the course i didn't mean this i meant
by use of the riveting gun and not the old

88
00:08:27,46 --> 00:08:33,10
hand riveting that used to be done in the
shipyards hamming them down. Sorry what.

89
00:08:34,25 --> 00:08:35,15
Do you remember any of it's

90
00:08:35,15 --> 00:08:38,41
a dense particularly you that you while
you were in the workshop to embody

91
00:08:38,41 --> 00:08:41,48
accidents in the first
place. Yes there were

92
00:08:41,48 --> 00:08:46,72
a couple of accidents that did occur and.

93
00:08:48,46 --> 00:08:55,15
One i remember the one of
the at one time. The dogman

94
00:08:55,15 --> 00:08:58,37
were carrying

95
00:08:59,21 --> 00:09:06,01
a very big. All long lengths
of angle lined to be fixed

96
00:09:06,01 --> 00:09:13,01
onto the rear. Drilling
machines and. Somehow

97
00:09:13,01 --> 00:09:19,72
or other it slipped from the just
as they were locating it on the

98
00:09:19,72 --> 00:09:26,13
stands it slipped off
there and hit one of the

99
00:09:26,13 --> 00:09:32,45
other dogman and broke a couple of
legs and it was in a bad way for

100
00:09:32,45 --> 00:09:38,30
a while. I also remember that
incident of the driller. Who

101
00:09:39,85 --> 00:09:46,67
was bending over the plate
that he was drilling to do

102
00:09:46,68 --> 00:09:47,80
something or other off

103
00:09:47,80 --> 00:09:54,43
a get exactly what it was at the drill it
was still running caught in his overalls

104
00:09:54,43 --> 00:09:59,50
and it. twelve him around and around quite

105
00:09:59,51 --> 00:10:05,53
a few times before they were able
to stop the drill there were

106
00:10:06,77 --> 00:10:10,31
other accidents. You know
something like that of

107
00:10:10,32 --> 00:10:15,53
a similar nature but i think they were
the main ones that i was able to see. To

108
00:10:15,53 --> 00:10:21,16
remember any amusing incidents in their
workshops do you. Yes we had our moments

109
00:10:21,16 --> 00:10:27,06
there at times you know they were pretty
hard times and but there were some good

110
00:10:27,06 --> 00:10:30,56
times. I used to be

111
00:10:30,56 --> 00:10:36,94
a big. American bloke we used to call the
yank and he worked on those mean girls

112
00:10:36,94 --> 00:10:43,87
that were out at the end of the wharf
and at he used to fancy himself as

113
00:10:43,87 --> 00:10:46,58
a flamethrower and. When things got

114
00:10:46,58 --> 00:10:51,43
a bit slack. He like to
entertain fellow workers by

115
00:10:54,57 --> 00:11:01,37
taking a mouthful of camera scene
and then spreading it out and onto

116
00:11:01,38 --> 00:11:01,82
a match and

117
00:11:01,82 --> 00:11:08,71
a great line of flame coming
resulting from his actions.

118
00:11:09,53 --> 00:11:16,36
The other one that sticks in my mind is
it. And i had an ironworker assisting me

119
00:11:17,16 --> 00:11:22,98
and his name was bluey white haired
blue we proclaimed himself to be

120
00:11:22,98 --> 00:11:25,02
a very tough guy and

121
00:11:25,02 --> 00:11:31,88
a very strong man. And he
used to get bags of rivets

122
00:11:32,70 --> 00:11:39,18
and to lift them from the floor in his
teeth. You were used to make beds of

123
00:11:39,18 --> 00:11:43,11
nails for him to lie on.
And there is to get

124
00:11:43,11 --> 00:11:49,32
a board with the nails and need braces
shoulders in these arms and he'd say hit me

125
00:11:49,32 --> 00:11:51,01
on the back and so we'd give him

126
00:11:51,01 --> 00:11:55,83
a whack with them need say oh that's
the stuff and i'd enjoy it. At times

127
00:11:57,95 --> 00:12:04,78
we'd go up outside the wharf there was
escalators and we'd go up to the top

128
00:12:04,78 --> 00:12:11,46
of the street at milton's point. And he
did engage in the pastime of pulling cars

129
00:12:11,46 --> 00:12:18,45
around in his teeth while all of the
successful exploits seemed to encouraging

130
00:12:18,45 --> 00:12:24,99
encourage him and he wanted to go to
greater heights and he thought i'd be

131
00:12:24,99 --> 00:12:31,46
a marvellous thing. If he and
i were to join together in.

132
00:12:32,98 --> 00:12:39,46
Another exploit and what he proposed to do
was to go to the top of the arch at the

133
00:12:39,46 --> 00:12:45,58
top chord. He was going to hang by his
legs from the top chord holding me in his

134
00:12:45,58 --> 00:12:50,19
teeth. Our was see thought
but that was a hell of

135
00:12:50,19 --> 00:12:55,99
a good idea. I wasn't too keen on it myself
and i think that's about where we fell

136
00:12:55,99 --> 00:13:02,97
out and the end of his exploits with
me. Do you remember the lunchers do

137
00:13:04,00 --> 00:13:09,28
use to go on in the workshops then.
Oh yes in the in the lunch hours.

138
00:13:12,10 --> 00:13:16,58
We only had are half an hour but it is
amazing how much you could fit into half an

139
00:13:16,58 --> 00:13:21,95
hour. At times. Some of the boys
myself charlie nunn jack crew and

140
00:13:23,56 --> 00:13:27,78
a couple of the others would get out onto
the wharf in the very hot weather and

141
00:13:27,78 --> 00:13:34,56
we'd dive into off the wharf into the
harbour. These to warn us that there was

142
00:13:34,56 --> 00:13:39,13
a few sharks around but been so young and

143
00:13:40,39 --> 00:13:46,46
a bit more daring than we are now didn't
seem to worry us all that much. Again

144
00:13:47,77 --> 00:13:48,12
there was

145
00:13:49,45 --> 00:13:55,86
a couple of crown and anchor boards always
going there and you know always have

146
00:13:55,86 --> 00:14:02,62
european ease. For if you had more money

147
00:14:02,63 --> 00:14:09,57
threepence is on the boards. They
filled in the lunch hours. How did

148
00:14:09,57 --> 00:14:13,81
you get to work and earn home again. Where
do you live then i live to draw my in at

149
00:14:13,81 --> 00:14:20,77
that time and we used to travel
from draw my own to circular quay.

150
00:14:21,67 --> 00:14:28,46
The fare from demy in then was four
pins each way. And the trip over two

151
00:14:29,24 --> 00:14:33,21
from circular quay to milton's
point was twopence that made

152
00:14:33,21 --> 00:14:37,92
a total of sixpence each way. A shilling

153
00:14:37,92 --> 00:14:43,85
a day due to cost us for fares.
There were unfortunate times when

154
00:14:46,03 --> 00:14:47,78
i was a bit indiscreet and

155
00:14:48,88 --> 00:14:52,87
a very good friend of mine at that time
and other apprentice was harold altgens.

156
00:14:53,39 --> 00:14:58,27
And he lived out around the forest lodge
and we used to go around that way

157
00:14:58,27 --> 00:15:05,02
sometimes through wide bay to draw mine.
And there were times when we put our

158
00:15:05,02 --> 00:15:08,13
pennies on the crown and
anchor board hoping to win

159
00:15:08,13 --> 00:15:14,40
a fortune. Instead of that we lost our
fare home. And that who we'd had our block

160
00:15:14,40 --> 00:15:19,81
of tickets for the fairy. Get across to the
quay or ride but from there on we used

161
00:15:19,81 --> 00:15:26,43
to have to scale the trams. All the way
home. As dodging the conductors. That's

162
00:15:26,43 --> 00:15:31,79
right. Yes you dodged the conductor you
get on the wrong side of the tram the

163
00:15:31,79 --> 00:15:36,30
opposite side of the tram to where the
conductor is or down the back in the rear

164
00:15:36,30 --> 00:15:41,16
driving compartment. And sometimes
you'd have to change trams

165
00:15:41,16 --> 00:15:48,13
a couple of times but we generally
made it. How much did you get paid to

166
00:15:48,13 --> 00:15:53,90
murders do you remember. Yes i do very
clearly. When i first started in my first

167
00:15:53,90 --> 00:15:56,53
year the wage rate was eighteen shillings

168
00:15:56,53 --> 00:16:03,37
a week in my second year it went up to
twenty four. Bob third year was thirty two

169
00:16:03,37 --> 00:16:09,57
and six the for the year was.

170
00:16:11,71 --> 00:16:17,74
Forty five shillings and
in my final year it was £3

171
00:16:18,73 --> 00:16:25,59
£3 but week in my last year. I
had my last all i still have my

172
00:16:25,59 --> 00:16:32,23
last pay envelope. It was dated
the 23rd of the eight thirty

173
00:16:32,23 --> 00:16:39,08
one. And it shows that instead of

174
00:16:40,94 --> 00:16:47,79
receiving the £3. I was paid to
pounce eighteen and threepence now

175
00:16:49,11 --> 00:16:55,96
that's one and nine and short and the
reason for this must be in that i was late.

176
00:16:56,01 --> 00:17:02,39
One morning. Now. Can anyone to

177
00:17:04,89 --> 00:17:07,09
vera lawson owe a woman

178
00:17:07,09 --> 00:17:13,90
a girl who was vera lawson
then. Who was in the office

179
00:17:13,90 --> 00:17:20,55
and at times she used to help with the
time sheet and making up of the pages

180
00:17:20,55 --> 00:17:26,81
and recently after all this time fifty
years i had the great pleasure of meeting

181
00:17:26,81 --> 00:17:33,72
her again. And i reminded her that i
was one and ninepence short in my

182
00:17:33,72 --> 00:17:40,20
last pay more than fifty years ago and
sought an explanation from she said well

183
00:17:40,20 --> 00:17:44,62
charlie you must have been late. I said
well i can't recall it. You said you might

184
00:17:44,62 --> 00:17:48,98
differ gotten it. But i said look i've
been worrying about this for fifty years

185
00:17:49,91 --> 00:17:53,96
where my one and nine months went to she
said well stop worrying. Here's you too.

186
00:17:53,99 --> 00:17:55,49
Bob. Now that makes

187
00:17:55,49 --> 00:18:02,22
a square. 200 immerse become
permanent. Yes yes well i

188
00:18:02,22 --> 00:18:04,41
were thruppence and i've got this for

189
00:18:04,41 --> 00:18:08,79
a prince and the next time i meet i'm
going to give it to us. That'll be at the

190
00:18:08,79 --> 00:18:15,16
reunion and rodeos. Yes that's
so yes. Well i think we're past

191
00:18:15,16 --> 00:18:21,77
a certain moments now you remember when
you were relieved of. High do as i say i

192
00:18:21,77 --> 00:18:28,45
finished late in 1931 all of these deal

193
00:18:28,45 --> 00:18:35,01
work. On the bridge had been
completed. And it was necessary to

194
00:18:35,77 --> 00:18:42,52
reduce staff. In those days
there was no week's notice. I

195
00:18:42,53 --> 00:18:49,26
remember clearly some of the men went door
in the weeks preceding myself going off

196
00:18:50,33 --> 00:18:56,60
and we used to finish at five o'clock at
those times about four o'clock alf market

197
00:18:56,60 --> 00:19:03,47
. Who was the foreman would
come down. And when he

198
00:19:03,47 --> 00:19:08,26
came down into the bays about that time
everybody would be looking at him with.

199
00:19:08,68 --> 00:19:15,19
Great apprehension. And he
would go up to a man and it's

200
00:19:15,19 --> 00:19:20,70
a your name is joe smith
yes. You have finished

201
00:19:20,70 --> 00:19:27,15
a night and that was the unceremonious
way in which you were told that you were

202
00:19:27,15 --> 00:19:32,83
finished as i say no weeks notice just
about an hour or less notice and that was

203
00:19:32,83 --> 00:19:36,65
the end of it. But it took you back to
the some of the other conditions in the

204
00:19:36,65 --> 00:19:41,04
workshops we haven't to cover it. Do you
remember what the working conditions were

205
00:19:41,04 --> 00:19:46,86
like in there yes well fifty years ago
there were none of the conditions that we

206
00:19:46,86 --> 00:19:52,35
have today. The shop itself was of

207
00:19:52,36 --> 00:19:55,24
a dirt floor. Had to be hosed down twice

208
00:19:55,24 --> 00:20:01,69
a day to keep the dust down
there was no washing facilities

209
00:20:02,99 --> 00:20:04,54
. If you want to do

210
00:20:04,54 --> 00:20:11,33
a wash. Before you went home. You're
washed under the tap the same

211
00:20:11,33 --> 00:20:17,74
tap that was used to attach the hose to
hose the floor down. There were not even

212
00:20:17,74 --> 00:20:21,59
bubblers drinking bubblers
in the shop. You got

213
00:20:21,59 --> 00:20:26,97
a drink from the same tap. There was no
dressing rooms there was not even anywhere

214
00:20:26,97 --> 00:20:32,44
to hang your clothes in. You had to find
some spot the corner of an angle iron or

215
00:20:32,44 --> 00:20:39,38
some part of the structure. To hang
your coat. And. And generally there was

216
00:20:39,38 --> 00:20:45,76
no as i said before there was no weeks.
Or each notice on dismissal there was no

217
00:20:45,76 --> 00:20:52,69
sickly. Compensation was not paid
until after three days. If you're on

218
00:20:52,69 --> 00:20:59,23
or off on compo for less than three days
you didn't get anything. It was about two

219
00:20:59,24 --> 00:21:04,99
thirds of pure weekly wages
then during member of

220
00:21:04,99 --> 00:21:08,36
a union activity in the
shops or yes yes that was

221
00:21:08,36 --> 00:21:11,10
a great part of it. It was in this way

222
00:21:11,10 --> 00:21:16,92
a very closely. Net
well-organized job to be on.

223
00:21:17,59 --> 00:21:24,24
And there was i remember
the and i felt the

224
00:21:25,38 --> 00:21:30,38
my chip the comradeship that
existed in the shop. I was only

225
00:21:30,38 --> 00:21:35,45
a small boy but some of the men
took me under their wing and

226
00:21:37,81 --> 00:21:38,42
you know gave me

227
00:21:38,42 --> 00:21:44,76
a great deal of support in my job
there. The when the meetings were held

228
00:21:45,67 --> 00:21:52,04
they were conducted out on the wharf. Near
where the angle smith worked and he had

229
00:21:52,04 --> 00:21:57,33
a block that he worked on and this was the
platform on which the chairman of the

230
00:21:57,33 --> 00:22:03,42
meeting and others addressed the
meeting the chairman was the

231
00:22:04,42 --> 00:22:10,81
the blacksmith in the on the job so far
as i can remember there was only the one

232
00:22:10,81 --> 00:22:12,20
blacksmith there and he was

233
00:22:12,20 --> 00:22:18,39
a big irishman called rared and he

234
00:22:19,93 --> 00:22:25,96
looking back i used to remind me of the
power and we learnt at school of the the

235
00:22:25,97 --> 00:22:32,47
village blacksmith with you know
great muscles and that he was

236
00:22:32,47 --> 00:22:39,12
a very very competent. Chairman
he kept the meeting under

237
00:22:39,12 --> 00:22:39,99
controlled and

238
00:22:39,99 --> 00:22:46,78
a well disciplined meeting that was the
result and decisions were made without

239
00:22:46,78 --> 00:22:52,27
wasting too much time at all. Do you member
anybody else. Speaking at the meetings

240
00:22:52,27 --> 00:22:52,57
we've got

241
00:22:52,57 --> 00:22:59,92
a particular yes i can one man
that sticks in my mind is the.

242
00:23:00,96 --> 00:23:07,03
He was the secretary of the ironworkers
union then colon tannic. And colin was

243
00:23:07,03 --> 00:23:13,66
a scotchman who still had
the. Scotch very very strong

244
00:23:14,53 --> 00:23:16,59
got accent. He was

245
00:23:16,59 --> 00:23:23,69
a very vigorous speaker and between

246
00:23:23,69 --> 00:23:30,13
him and reardon. It resulted
in very informative

247
00:23:30,13 --> 00:23:36,34
well-conducted meetings to us apprentices
who shouldn't have been there

248
00:23:37,20 --> 00:23:42,61
because we were not affected by decisions
of the meeting or what was going on. We

249
00:23:42,61 --> 00:23:49,03
always took up the front positions
at the meeting and thoroughly

250
00:23:49,04 --> 00:23:55,50
enjoyed this addresses to the
meeting by these two men.

251
00:23:56,28 --> 00:23:59,38
That were there are many
strokes were. There were

252
00:23:59,38 --> 00:24:03,20
a few ideas by comparison
the day they were just

253
00:24:03,20 --> 00:24:09,61
a few not many at all but
it will realize that

254
00:24:10,72 --> 00:24:17,46
they were bad times and
the job. Was becoming

255
00:24:18,95 --> 00:24:25,39
more dangerous as it progressed
and it was necessary to

256
00:24:28,20 --> 00:24:34,78
maintain. And if possible improve the
wages and conditions that existed

257
00:24:34,78 --> 00:24:37,35
and it was necessary at times for

258
00:24:37,35 --> 00:24:44,15
a stoppage. I think i only have about
one day's duration. There wasn't any

259
00:24:44,15 --> 00:24:51,03
lengthy stoppages at all. Who
is the records agree with you.

260
00:24:51,05 --> 00:24:56,12
Do you do you remember what happened to
you after you finished up on the bridge

261
00:24:56,12 --> 00:25:02,57
where were you for instance when the bridge
was opened. Well nineteen end of 1931

262
00:25:02,57 --> 00:25:08,76
was in the depths of the depression. I
finished up there with my last week's pay.

263
00:25:08,98 --> 00:25:14,71
I think also that because i was about three
months short of the five years that i

264
00:25:14,71 --> 00:25:20,24
was in danger to i got as i
remember about fifty pounds.

265
00:25:21,54 --> 00:25:27,92
That's what i had my father was
unemployed. He'd been thrown out of

266
00:25:28,93 --> 00:25:29,72
employment. He was

267
00:25:29,72 --> 00:25:36,78
a victim of the depression
at that time and i being

268
00:25:36,79 --> 00:25:43,25
a fully fledged tradesman
then full of hope went around

269
00:25:43,25 --> 00:25:48,55
a few of the steel fabrication shops at
the time i remember going to sydney steel

270
00:25:48,55 --> 00:25:49,50
looking for

271
00:25:49,50 --> 00:25:54,73
a job and i chased me out of the bloody
place. There was enough. And no hope at all

272
00:25:54,73 --> 00:25:57,51
. Of getting a job rather than

273
00:25:58,60 --> 00:26:04,20
a stop home under the conditions that
existed then. I took to the bush.

274
00:26:07,24 --> 00:26:11,06
My first stop was all
brief from there with

275
00:26:11,06 --> 00:26:16,95
a cousin of mine. We travelled through
the victoria and other parts carrier now

276
00:26:16,95 --> 00:26:23,60
swag and in fact on the day that the
bridge was open the 19th of march

277
00:26:23,60 --> 00:26:30,13
1932. I was camped under another much
smaller bridge. It was the bridge over the

278
00:26:30,13 --> 00:26:37,03
campeche be reverse at elmore in victoria.
No glory for you on the opening

279
00:26:37,03 --> 00:26:43,90
day no none at all as i say i finished
up on the bridge without too much fuss

280
00:26:43,90 --> 00:26:46,07
without too much glory with

281
00:26:46,07 --> 00:26:52,63
a great future behind me and the
wide open road in front of me.

282
00:26:52,65 --> 00:26:59,62
Do you remember what you've got
for the dole in those days. Yes.

283
00:26:59,64 --> 00:27:00,75
Victoria was

284
00:27:00,75 --> 00:27:06,73
a better place for. Collecting
the dial and in new south wales.

285
00:27:07,16 --> 00:27:13,78
Because if you kept travelling and
went through it from town to town

286
00:27:14,76 --> 00:27:21,47
. You could collect the dole in each
town it amounted to about six shillings.

287
00:27:22,98 --> 00:27:28,86
I'm not sure but i think in new south wales.
Well i'm sure that in new south wales

288
00:27:28,86 --> 00:27:32,76
it was only once per week. No matter
where you were whether you're in

289
00:27:32,76 --> 00:27:35,04
a different town or not because there was

290
00:27:35,04 --> 00:27:41,99
a brick lane day on which you only you
could collect the dole. It was in

291
00:27:41,99 --> 00:27:42,58
the form of

292
00:27:42,58 --> 00:27:50,03
a voucher that you took this voucher
to the shops or the store. And you

293
00:27:51,13 --> 00:27:58,09
in return. You've got your tea and your
sugar and braid and all that sort of thing

294
00:27:58,09 --> 00:28:00,36
i can remember as

295
00:28:00,37 --> 00:28:06,94
a matter of fact the first time i
attempted to get the dole was in all brie

296
00:28:06,94 --> 00:28:11,69
and you had to sort of establish yourself
once you were on it. Your all right. But

297
00:28:11,69 --> 00:28:18,12
getting on it was pretty tough. And at the
old ripley's station who were in charge

298
00:28:18,12 --> 00:28:20,58
of issuing these vouchers. There was

299
00:28:20,58 --> 00:28:27,52
a great line of men waiting for it. I
got in the line. And when it came to

300
00:28:27,52 --> 00:28:32,53
my turn. There was a massive big sigh

301
00:28:32,53 --> 00:28:38,36
a gent sitting at the desk. And he said
yes. As if he didn't know what i was there

302
00:28:38,36 --> 00:28:41,60
for. And i said and i could have

303
00:28:41,60 --> 00:28:47,60
a bowl about you please. Without even looking
up he said where do you come from. I

304
00:28:47,60 --> 00:28:50,21
said i come from sydney. So it was

305
00:28:50,21 --> 00:28:54,59
a try in leaving the station up there at
three o'clock this afternoon be on it and

306
00:28:54,59 --> 00:28:59,77
i said what about me doubts aj and he said
get out so i bloody well got out but i

307
00:28:59,77 --> 00:29:03,92
didn't go away. I got on the end of the
queue again. And when it came to me turned

308
00:29:03,92 --> 00:29:07,15
again he'd forgotten all about
that and i establish myself as

309
00:29:07,15 --> 00:29:14,11
a recipient of the dole. Yes. Did
you get any other work in the

310
00:29:14,11 --> 00:29:20,51
in all brew during the time the yes.
Well when we were travelling around

311
00:29:20,52 --> 00:29:27,21
the country. We were constantly
looking for bits of casual work fruit

312
00:29:27,21 --> 00:29:32,81
picking in various areas
and great picking.

313
00:29:34,14 --> 00:29:41,09
Farm work in the harvesting
season. It was. High to be cut

314
00:29:41,09 --> 00:29:47,94
and carted in there was. To be harvested
bags so in carting into the silos

315
00:29:49,79 --> 00:29:56,15
and wherever it was available. We got this
job temporary as it was but it kept us

316
00:29:56,15 --> 00:30:01,44
going. And all brie in
those days there was

317
00:30:01,44 --> 00:30:07,82
a break of the gauge and goods fruit

318
00:30:07,82 --> 00:30:13,12
etc from or going into new south wales
had to be trained shipped there.
