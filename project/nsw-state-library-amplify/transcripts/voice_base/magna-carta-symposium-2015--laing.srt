00:00:00,2 --> 00:00:06,99
A graduate of Sydney Oxford and a stray and National University she joined the Senate department in Dante ninety

2
00:00:06,99 --> 00:00:12,88
and occupied saying your perceived Ramin management roles before being appointed Deputy Clarke in two thousand

3
00:00:12,88 --> 00:00:13,61
and five.

4
00:00:14,06 --> 00:00:20,61
The parliamentary interests include powers privileges and immunities of Parliament and alleged to the process.

5
00:00:21,46 --> 00:00:25,37
She is the editor of the straw and Senate practice two thousand and twelve

6
00:00:25,37 --> 00:00:29,67
and the annotated standing orders of the astray and Senate two thousand

7
00:00:29,67 --> 00:00:37,53
and nine other interests include literature history and travel topic to die is going to be a strike as Magna Carta.

8
00:00:37,86 --> 00:00:48,4
And I would ask you to welcome him. Well thank you very much and good morning everybody.

9
00:00:48,66 --> 00:00:54,23
It's a pleasure to be here in sunny Sydney after a fairly cool start the small inning.

10
00:00:54,74 --> 00:00:58,86
I acknowledge and indorse the early knowledge man of country

11
00:00:58,86 --> 00:01:04,58
and also thank the State Law of Three of New South Wales the history Council of New South Wales

12
00:01:04,58 --> 00:01:12,1
and the Magna Carta Committee of the Rule of Law Institute for the symposium today.

13
00:01:12,12 --> 00:01:18,21
Now it was Rupert broke who died one hundred years ago this year who said that history repeats itself.

14
00:01:18,86 --> 00:01:21,22
Historians repaid one another.

15
00:01:22,76 --> 00:01:29,78
For what I have to say this morning was very heavily on work done by Professor Nicholas Vincent Professor medieval

16
00:01:29,78 --> 00:01:35,75
history at the University of East Anglia who is a renowned expert on Magna Carta.

17
00:01:35,77 --> 00:01:37,38
I'm no such expert

18
00:01:37,38 --> 00:01:46,56
but I'm here to tell you about a document that I have shared premises with for the past twenty five years.

19
00:01:46,58 --> 00:01:54,71
Because it's not widely known that a stranger has one of the original exemplification of an early issue of Magna Carta.

20
00:01:55,01 --> 00:02:02,03
In other words a copy that was made at the time of issue for promulgating. And throughout the country.

21
00:02:02,81 --> 00:02:08,07
It dates from twelve ninety seven and was issued by Ed with the first

22
00:02:09,01 --> 00:02:16,11
and as we've heard from Professor cadre based on the twelve twenty five text which differed in many important respects

23
00:02:16,11 --> 00:02:20,22
from the original twelve fifteen charter.

24
00:02:20,24 --> 00:02:24,26
So striking is copies a very rare treasure that there are only twenty three

25
00:02:24,26 --> 00:02:32,98
or twenty four such exemplification surviving from the thirteenth century from the issues up to thirteen hundred

26
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:43,81
and the most recent one was discovered only this year and of course great Hartmann to munch the Magna Carta scholars.

27
00:02:44,55 --> 00:02:59,53
Are only two of these rare things held outside the United Kingdom the other ones in private ownership in the United.

28
00:02:52,27 --> 00:02:57,66
States but it's on permanent display in the National Archives in Washington D.C.

29
00:02:59,55 --> 00:03:07,00
Now let me start by saying that a strenuous Magna Carta belongs to the Commonwealth Parliament is on permanent display

30
00:03:07,73 --> 00:03:14,79
in Parliament House Canberra having been moved there in ninety nine from all Parliament House where it had been on

31
00:03:14,79 --> 00:03:18,51
display for most of the time since nineteen sixty one.

32
00:03:18,82 --> 00:03:22,63
Now that seems like a very simple part of history of effect

33
00:03:22,63 --> 00:03:33,37
but behind these bold statements like tiles that intrigue me institutional rivalry the most incredible luck bit of

34
00:03:33,37 --> 00:03:42,08
incompetence that matched up the desire of an impact as minor English public school with the nation

35
00:03:42,08 --> 00:03:45,94
and institution building ambitions of.

36
00:03:45,95 --> 00:03:56,17
An influential Cambra librarian of the fifty's and sixty's to acquire treasures for the new National Library.

37
00:03:56,19 --> 00:04:00,03
Now Nicholas Vincent describes in wonderful child.

38
00:04:00,2 --> 00:04:07,08
In an S I published in this little booklet which department published a couple of years ago.

39
00:04:07,27 --> 00:04:14,77
Unless the first edition is sold out but excitingly the second edition revised

40
00:04:14,78 --> 00:04:23,62
and expanded with a lot more material is in print at the printers as we speak and will be published shortly

41
00:04:23,62 --> 00:04:31,19
and for details of that watch the Department of the Senate website for how you can get hold of a copy because it's a

42
00:04:31,19 --> 00:04:37,2
delightful little booklet it's been the subject of the answers to Senate estimates hearings

43
00:04:37,2 --> 00:04:45,91
and I'm sure the second edition will feature as well. Now that's all the advertising on going to do at the moment.

44
00:04:45,93 --> 00:04:48,51
Let me just sketch the background

45
00:04:48,51 --> 00:04:55,39
and fortunately Professor catteries covered quite a lot of this material so I want to have to repeat it.

46
00:04:55,5 --> 00:05:03,34
But just remind you that the twelve fifteen charter of liberties was followed reasonably quickly after the death of

47
00:05:03,34 --> 00:05:10,04
John by reaching issues in twelve sixteen and twelve seventeen and importantly

48
00:05:10,04 --> 00:05:19,22
and I want you to remember it's the twelve seven attain issue of the charter which became known as Magna Carta had a

49
00:05:19,22 --> 00:05:25,82
companion child the forest Chacha. And the two of them had a bit of a shared life.

50
00:05:26,05 --> 00:05:34,17
Thereafter for a while and the first charter as we heard allowed common people into the king's forests

51
00:05:34,17 --> 00:05:42,43
and gave them certain rights of. Having a pig's root around foot or whatever cetera.

52
00:05:42,83 --> 00:05:46,4
That had been the prerogative of the monarch before then.

53
00:05:48,23 --> 00:05:55,91
The twelve twenty five issue of of the charter issued when Henry the third reached eighteen years of age

54
00:05:56,62 --> 00:05:59,78
when it was influential in becoming a foundation for.

55
00:06:00,2 --> 00:06:10,15
Later issues and I'll move on quickly to the reign of Edward the First because by twelve ninety seven. The.

56
00:06:10,95 --> 00:06:19,12
It with the first had suppressed and conquered whiles he was waging campaigns in France and Scotland

57
00:06:19,99 --> 00:06:21,05
and he'd run out of money.

58
00:06:21,12 --> 00:06:34,01
He's a talian bankers had gone bankrupt and therefore longer a source of income for him and he needed to raise funds.

59
00:06:34,03 --> 00:06:39,63
He had few options other than to summon up Parliament and ask for supply.

60
00:06:40,11 --> 00:06:48,16
To be funded from new levies and taxes but in return parliament demanded that the charters about the forest charter

61
00:06:48,16 --> 00:06:50,46
and Magna Carta be reissued

62
00:06:51,36 --> 00:06:58,11
and it went off to fight in France with these newly founded I mean he's And while he was away.

63
00:06:58,18 --> 00:07:01,77
He's Regency Council issued the list.

64
00:07:01,88 --> 00:07:05,89
Letters page and reciting the text of both the charters

65
00:07:05,89 --> 00:07:14,16
and ordering their dispatched to the various parts of the various counties and for this purpose copies worldwide.

66
00:07:14,17 --> 00:07:17,27
So it's one of those copies that's now in Canberra

67
00:07:17,27 --> 00:07:26,76
and we know exactly which copy it is because like all good clocks I left their mark on the digital copies so that they

68
00:07:26,76 --> 00:07:36,88
could be checked and we know that our copy of the Magna Carta. Was destined for the county of sorry.

69
00:07:37,59 --> 00:07:45,24
The theory is that it was delivered to the sheriff of sorry who also happened to be the joint sheriff of the next door

70
00:07:45,24 --> 00:07:51,48
county of Sussex and given into the custody of the nuns of these born Priory for safekeeping.

71
00:07:51,89 --> 00:07:58,53
And it remained there we think until the dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century.

72
00:07:58,55 --> 00:08:07,76
Now whole collection of dock. Humans from the Priory then apparently passed into the hands of a family who.

73
00:08:07,78 --> 00:08:15,46
Decades centuries later engage the services of a solicitor John. Mouche Louch.

74
00:08:16,15 --> 00:08:25,68
From the town of Driton in some a sage a town about twenty miles from the King's School version.

75
00:08:26,32 --> 00:08:31,64
Where our twelve ninety seven copy miraculously kind to live.

76
00:08:33,39 --> 00:08:40,67
Now the documents that were originally in The Priory somehow ended up with this solicitor John Louch.

77
00:08:40,69 --> 00:08:48,67
We don't know how his copy of the twelve ninety seven Magna Carta ended up in the King's School that no connection has

78
00:08:48,67 --> 00:08:54,32
been discovered between latch and the school all the firm of solicitors and the school

79
00:08:54,32 --> 00:08:57,44
but there is a local legend that says that.

80
00:08:58,83 --> 00:09:10,07
The school's lawyers blunder mistakenly putting documents in the wrong box possibly returning to the school a document

81
00:09:10,07 --> 00:09:17,16
that didn't belong to the school but was discovered this subsequently many years later.

82
00:09:17,18 --> 00:09:25,32
We do not know what happened to the rest of Laotians men scripts because after he died his son donated them to the

83
00:09:25,32 --> 00:09:26,12
British Museum.

84
00:09:26,61 --> 00:09:27,81
Now the British Library

85
00:09:29,75 --> 00:09:40,4
and the collection included importantly the sorry copy of the forrest chacha of twelve ninety seven.

86
00:09:40,4 --> 00:09:44,67
So that companion child. We've got the twelve ninety seven.

87
00:09:44,8 --> 00:09:55,15
Sorry Magna Carta the British Library Scott the twelve ninety seven forests chacha But even in the best of libraries

88
00:09:55,93 --> 00:10:05,32
things can go wrong. And according to nickel. Vincent. Owing to a casual logging era.

89
00:10:06,14 --> 00:10:14,99
And a five year to identify the forest charter as an original copy of dieting from twelve ninety seven.

90
00:10:16,33 --> 00:10:24,13
The British Museum didn't quite appreciate what it had in its possession. So.

91
00:10:24,15 --> 00:10:33,38
When the King's School in Bruton in need of some cash decided to offer its copy for Syal you know the British Museum

92
00:10:33,38 --> 00:10:35,54
and said well how much will you give us

93
00:10:36,39 --> 00:10:44,97
and the British Museum not realizing what it was looking at in relation to its our holdings said two to two

94
00:10:44,97 --> 00:10:47,34
and a half thousand pounds.

95
00:10:47,36 --> 00:10:56,69
School was pretty disappointed at that valuation went to Southern bees and saw the bee said least ten thousand pounds.

96
00:10:56,7 --> 00:11:05,16
So the school commissioned the bees to sell the Magna Carta by Prophet. Tracy.

97
00:11:05,18 --> 00:11:10,8
And to the British Library failure to identify the connection

98
00:11:10,8 --> 00:11:19,35
and what it already had was really quite pivotal in the machinations that followed about the permissions needed to

99
00:11:19,35 --> 00:11:27,82
export. The document when the time came. Those machinations are beautifully covered by Nicholas Vincent.

100
00:11:28,01 --> 00:11:30,33
So I won't go into them here.

101
00:11:30,71 --> 00:11:41,51
But we ended up with a situation where Harold white the librarian or I should actually show us.

102
00:11:42,98 --> 00:11:53,73
This is it in its Ark kies which I'll tell you about a little in a minute. How or why the librarian. Located this and.

103
00:11:53,74 --> 00:12:02,03
Arranged to buy it for an asking price of twelve and a half thousand pounds. STERLING.

104
00:12:02,05 --> 00:12:08,49
Now in astronomy and pounds of the time this was about fifteen thousand six hundred pounds.

105
00:12:08,5 --> 00:12:15,2
That's just a sum of money so I thought you know how do we make this comparable recognizable to something that we

106
00:12:15,2 --> 00:12:18,55
recognise today. In other Sydney real estate prices.

107
00:12:21,32 --> 00:12:30,32
So I consulted the Sydney Morning Herald for the fourteenth of June fifty two which was the date closest to the

108
00:12:31,03 --> 00:12:33,88
anniversary and nine hundred fifty two was the year of purchase.

109
00:12:33,97 --> 00:12:39,12
I found a very small number of properties in that price range.

110
00:12:39,14 --> 00:12:45,89
You could buy a fine gentleman as residence on a large block on the no shore of the eastern suburbs.

111
00:12:45,9 --> 00:12:51,01
Between about six and a half to twenty thousand pounds.

112
00:12:51,03 --> 00:12:59,83
But people with fifteen thousand six hundred might have considered one of the following.

113
00:13:00,96 --> 00:13:03,51
Exhibit one a two story residence in Moore

114
00:13:03,51 --> 00:13:10,9
and got three reception rooms three bedrooms multiple bathrooms detached double garage lovely gardens such consular

115
00:13:10,9 --> 00:13:17,32
officials all retired graziers sixteen thousand pounds. Exhibit two.

116
00:13:17,93 --> 00:13:25,65
A stately bungalow in war a weight build with the best pre-war materials for reception rooms four bedrooms multiple

117
00:13:25,65 --> 00:13:34,8
bathrooms detached double garage with econd. Artist landscape gardens tennis court Bush House saw and stone.

118
00:13:34,81 --> 00:13:38,45
Ne aspect for fifteen thousand pounds

119
00:13:38,45 --> 00:13:45,31
or Finally a Spanish style two story home in Clifton gardens with sweeping harbor views from all windows.

120
00:13:46,02 --> 00:13:52,7
Lofty reception whole balcony staircase large lounge a dining room study staff quarters four bedrooms multiple

121
00:13:52,7 --> 00:14:00,57
bathrooms terraced gardens and fish ponds impossible to build this prize. Fifteen thousand on. Often.

122
00:14:00,8 --> 00:14:05,53
It other would while Magna Carta was bought for a very substantial sum.

123
00:14:05,77 --> 00:14:13,89
It was not a fortune beyond imagination particularly for a national government even one counting its pennies so

124
00:14:13,89 --> 00:14:18,05
carefully in a period of post.

125
00:14:18,07 --> 00:14:26,35
Now the purchase as I mentioned was headed by a Harold watch parliamentary librarian from nineteen forty seven to

126
00:14:26,35 --> 00:14:27,6
nineteen sixty seven.

127
00:14:28,12 --> 00:14:35,9
But from its earliest days the parliamentary library was always a bit of a hybrid it was also a National Library.

128
00:14:36,55 --> 00:14:44,13
And what therefore played a role the national component of the library was known as the Commonwealth National Library

129
00:14:44,13 --> 00:14:53,13
and it was governed by overseen by a joint parliamentary committee comprising the larger committees of the house.

130
00:14:54,46 --> 00:14:56,88
Which were empowered to make to get the for that purpose.

131
00:14:58,72 --> 00:15:07,12
The committee encourage watch to pursue a determined collection policy with an eye on the ultimate separation of the

132
00:15:07,12 --> 00:15:10,75
parliament she lobby from the National Library.

133
00:15:10,77 --> 00:15:18,66
Now this actually happened as a result of legislation in nineteen sixty stepless Xing the National Library which moved

134
00:15:18,66 --> 00:15:25,94
into new premises on the shores of the brand new like Burley Griffin in ninety six the ITE.

135
00:15:25,96 --> 00:15:35,25
In the meantime White's magnificent purchase arrived in Australia and spent several years at C.S.I.

136
00:15:35,25 --> 00:15:42,97
Our own premises being examined and scientists working out the best while conserving it

137
00:15:42,97 --> 00:15:54,85
and they ended up building a crime glass case for it filled with gas and it's still in that.

138
00:15:57,41 --> 00:16:00,03
It's due to be examined again. CERN.

139
00:16:00,9 --> 00:16:04,18
And we'll see what happens to it then but in nine hundred fifty two

140
00:16:04,18 --> 00:16:07,32
when the purchase was my there it was announced with great excitement

141
00:16:08,33 --> 00:16:14,46
and met with great enthusiasm to the two houses of the parliament.

142
00:16:14,48 --> 00:16:22,93
Prime Minister Menzies despite his efforts on the Communist Party dissolution Bill made a resulting tribute to Magna

143
00:16:22,93 --> 00:16:27,57
Carta as the first charter of civil liberties the basis of the rule of law

144
00:16:28,29 --> 00:16:35,21
and the precursor of democratic principles opposition leader Doc Rivers who we've also heard about Smalling referred to

145
00:16:35,21 --> 00:16:40,91
the charters embodiment of the rule of law liberty and a hatred of the tree government.

146
00:16:41,85 --> 00:16:51,21
He referred to as contemporary resonance in a world so recently asylum by totalitarianism bouts of the left in the Raj.

147
00:16:51,22 --> 00:16:52,31
But it was said that president.

148
00:16:52,85 --> 00:17:02,83
Sen Edward man who perhaps put his finger on Magna Carta has enduring significance and resonance. He said. This case.

149
00:17:02,95 --> 00:17:09,99
Lee One great principle of the English Constitution of the present which is not a raid into the provisions of Magna

150
00:17:09,99 --> 00:17:14,24
Carta. Now many of these were wrongly claimed to flow from Magna Carta.

151
00:17:14,86 --> 00:17:21,85
But we cannot afford to underestimate the value of traditional interpretations whether they were historically well

152
00:17:21,85 --> 00:17:22,09
founded

153
00:17:22,09 --> 00:17:30,26
or real founders the greatness of Magna Carta lies not so much in what it was to its frame as in twelve fifteen.

154
00:17:30,28 --> 00:17:34,91
As in what it afterwards became to the political leaders to the judges and lawyers

155
00:17:34,91 --> 00:17:41,06
and to the entire mass of the men of England of the astray

156
00:17:41,06 --> 00:17:46,05
and constitution in body as it does the principles of British liberty

157
00:17:46,05 --> 00:17:55,52
and representative government is in that sense a true lineal descendant of the greit charter.

158
00:17:55,54 --> 00:18:02,9
I think if he'd been alive to see the castle no doubt he would have preferred to. Five of the Magna Carta as well.

159
00:18:04,82 --> 00:18:12,42
So in not in sixty one Magna Carta merged from the ministrations of the scientists

160
00:18:12,43 --> 00:18:23,29
and was put on what everyone except old White thought of as a permanent display in King's House between the two

161
00:18:23,29 --> 00:18:23,7
chambers

162
00:18:24,76 --> 00:18:32,87
and director of the British Museum at the time Sir Frank Francis the chairman of the National Lottery Council said

163
00:18:32,87 --> 00:18:48,06
Grenfell inspecting the magnet in things hole of Parliament House. But over the winter recess in nineteen sixty eight.

164
00:18:48,53 --> 00:18:52,37
Magna Carta disappeared from King's hole.

165
00:18:52,39 --> 00:18:58,22
And when the houses resumed there was great consternation questions were asked in the House

166
00:18:59,11 --> 00:19:08,92
and the speaker rather apologetically explained that doubts about the iron ship the document.

167
00:19:08,94 --> 00:19:16,87
By the parliament and he in the president of the Senate had accepted that temporary custody and solve it

168
00:19:16,87 --> 00:19:26,35
and that it really begun bought for the National Library which now had its spanking brand new building to which Magna

169
00:19:26,35 --> 00:19:29,49
Carta had removed for the winter recess.

170
00:19:29,69 --> 00:19:38,57
He did hint that as being overseas at the time it was really the Senate president that was responsible for the

171
00:19:38,57 --> 00:19:39,49
difference.

172
00:19:40,37 --> 00:19:49,95
Plusa well had wash the librarian was lambasted in the houses for spiriting the Magna Carta away with parliamentary

173
00:19:49,95 --> 00:19:57,92
approval. How could it possibly have been bought by an institution that didn't even exist at the time of the purchase.

174
00:19:57,94 --> 00:19:59,93
Member Hindmarsh Claude.

175
00:20:00,2 --> 00:20:04,71
Cameron in a fiery adjournments space age more than one hundred members

176
00:20:04,71 --> 00:20:12,96
and senators signed a petition for the return of the Magna Carta to Parliament House Prime Minister Gordon said nothing

177
00:20:12,96 --> 00:20:15,48
to do with me it's a matter for the presiding offices

178
00:20:16,55 --> 00:20:25,6
and in the Senate opposition leader Lionel Murphy asked the Senate president Marlin to accept the petition as a firm

179
00:20:25,6 --> 00:20:30,91
expression of the desire of the Senate to have the document returned.

180
00:20:30,93 --> 00:20:38,76
Now President McMullan agreed to act this in turn cause some senators to be quite concerned that they are DIA that the

181
00:20:38,76 --> 00:20:47,83
president would contemplate acting in his official capacity on the basis of an informal education.

182
00:20:47,85 --> 00:20:55,51
So Senator Ridge with is brought forward a motion on the evening of the twenty seventh of November nineteenth sixty

183
00:20:55,51 --> 00:21:04,98
eight to the effect that in the Senate's opinion. The best place for Magna Carta to reside was in the National Library.

184
00:21:05,00 --> 00:21:11,74
This was done he said to test the will of the Senate in a formal way to allow the voices of the minority to be heard

185
00:21:11,74 --> 00:21:13,86
and to ensure that the president

186
00:21:13,86 --> 00:21:19,13
when he acted would be doing so in accordance with the wishes of a majority of the Senate.

187
00:21:19,17 --> 00:21:28,62
In other words he was concerned that due process for which Magna Carta was saying now is a guarantee he should provide

188
00:21:28,62 --> 00:21:34,88
the Senate a lot of Murphy moved an amendment to the motion to admit National Library

189
00:21:34,88 --> 00:21:38,81
and substitute Parliament House and over the next.

190
00:21:39,03 --> 00:21:47,3
Well again nothing changes over the next hour and a half the senators argue the toss between the two.

191
00:21:47,31 --> 00:21:55,54
Despite the funds coming from the Prime Minister's Department with I had been earmarked for purchases for the new

192
00:21:55,54 --> 00:22:00,00
National Library a mere technicality. Senator Murphy.

193
00:22:00,2 --> 00:22:07,76
That parliament had actually appropriated the funds to buy a document for display in Parliament House where it could be

194
00:22:07,76 --> 00:22:20,21
seen by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year on like a library place of dollars ship research and quietness.

195
00:22:20,22 --> 00:22:27,46
Not a place for visitors to be tramping around he said now the technicalities of ownership are interesting

196
00:22:27,46 --> 00:22:33,06
and the source of the farms all very well but of course the real play was to emotion

197
00:22:33,06 --> 00:22:40,1
and the rightful place of documents as iconic as Magna Carta in Parliament House.

198
00:22:40,12 --> 00:22:45,84
I believe that Parliament is the voice of the people parliament is the most precious thing in our way of life

199
00:22:45,84 --> 00:22:54,88
and it stems initially from the Magna Carta said Senator Anderson in arguing for the return of the document Senator

200
00:22:54,88 --> 00:23:01,73
Rand leader of the government in the Senate. And despite the legal niceties.

201
00:23:02,57 --> 00:23:11,73
About the ship the Senate voted overwhelmingly to express its view that Magna Carta the return to Parliament House.

202
00:23:11,75 --> 00:23:14,04
How would one knew when he was basin.

203
00:23:14,33 --> 00:23:22,62
So he relinquished custody of the art affect the precious treasure was returned to Kings hole where it was referred to

204
00:23:22,62 --> 00:23:29,3
occasionally in debates. For example in one thousand nine hundred six in the Australian card bill device there were.

205
00:23:30,39 --> 00:23:34,13
Exhortations of Magna Carta sitting out there in members' hole

206
00:23:35,28 --> 00:23:44,9
and in ninety ninety eight it was moved up to the new Parliament House in the equivalent place to members hole in the

207
00:23:44,9 --> 00:23:54,56
Old Parliament House the legal niceties of our ship were result. She'll be placed here in two thousand and five by.

208
00:23:54,58 --> 00:23:59,95
A deed signed by the then director general of the National Library and.

209
00:24:00,2 --> 00:24:05,46
That then secretary of the department of Parliamentary Services transferring both are in a ship

210
00:24:05,46 --> 00:24:12,32
and custody to the power amount of the Commonwealth of Australia. And in two thousand and ten.

211
00:24:13,52 --> 00:24:20,92
It moved into its current position as part of an exhibition on the law making process.

212
00:24:20,94 --> 00:24:24,51
It had been housed in a fairly D.M.

213
00:24:24,51 --> 00:24:31,01
Little cubby in Memphis hole where many people walked past it

214
00:24:31,01 --> 00:24:38,48
and didn't realise what it was in the next little cubby there was the title that Queen Victoria signed the Constitution

215
00:24:38,48 --> 00:24:41,2
act on that cubby on the other side had.

216
00:24:41,89 --> 00:24:48,16
The petitions and there was another copy with our Can't remember what's what was in there but in two thousand

217
00:24:48,16 --> 00:25:00,59
and ten we brought it more into prominence and it's currently in a very visible place. Just to give you.

218
00:25:00,62 --> 00:25:10,45
I did promise non-revenue ties in but that part of the exhibition is online and you can view it that that address.

219
00:25:10,47 --> 00:25:18,05
So to conclude the Magna Carta is a resting quality saw perhaps in the words of the Council it's vibe.

220
00:25:18,06 --> 00:25:21,43
Both physical and emotional because it's a beautiful document

221
00:25:21,43 --> 00:25:31,14
and as beautiful as this rep reproduction is the twelve ninety seven copy in Canberra is quite glorious.

222
00:25:32,1 --> 00:25:40,13
That physical and emotional element continue to attract generations of visitors to Parliament House

223
00:25:40,97 --> 00:25:49,1
and of course this eight hundredth anniversary of the original ceiling of twelve fifteen charter provides a great

224
00:25:49,1 --> 00:26:03,1
opportunity to excite new generations about its significance. Thank you very much. Well thank you.

225
00:26:03,19 --> 00:26:08,1
Rosemary for that that wonderful story that intriguing story and I'm sure they'll be questions

226
00:26:08,1 --> 00:26:28,7
and we do have a bit of time for them. So any questions. Planes are excellent.

227
00:26:28,72 --> 00:26:40,56
Well it's still in perfect working order. It is to be inspected and possibly possibly opened and I guess replaced.

228
00:26:41,18 --> 00:26:50,97
You know experts consulted on technologies that would be appropriate. Today. But what your father did in the fifty's.

229
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:55,29
I think was designed to last for many many years

230
00:26:55,29 --> 00:27:06,94
and it certainly has given that that document was lying around in cupboards

231
00:27:06,94 --> 00:27:13,36
and goodness knows where of the many centuries what sort of condition was already in when it arrived here

232
00:27:13,36 --> 00:27:15,99
and was so much restoration work required.

233
00:27:17,38 --> 00:27:24,97
Look that it wasn't it wasn't just floating around the school again legend has it that it was found in a desk

234
00:27:24,97 --> 00:27:31,54
but I think it was you know fairly well protected and it was actually in quite good condition.

235
00:27:31,82 --> 00:27:43,45
This is an essay in this little book by sorry but the former director of odd services home

236
00:27:43,45 --> 00:27:51,18
and house who is now the curator of manuscripts at the National Library has written about the details of its

237
00:27:52,12 --> 00:27:59,86
conservation and the work that had to be done and I would be happy to give you that reference it will come.

238
00:28:00,2 --> 00:28:07,12
Second Edition. It will be it. It'll be a great price ten dollars and it's still there.

239
00:28:07,15 --> 00:28:12,91
This is actually this one has been the best seller of the parliament house shop.

240
00:28:13,17 --> 00:28:21,51
Now that I say something about the rest of the country.

241
00:28:21,53 --> 00:28:25,57
Rosemary's mentioned there are two originals of the Magna Carta outside of England

242
00:28:25,57 --> 00:28:32,06
and she's told you to reflect story of Australia's. I just thought you might be interested to complete the picture.

243
00:28:33,5 --> 00:28:38,75
In the other one which is in the United States of America which Rosemary mentioned.

244
00:28:38,77 --> 00:28:48,59
It was provided by the Brudenell family of park in Northamptonshire here in nineteen eighty three.

245
00:28:50,18 --> 00:28:57,63
And it was purchased by Ross Perot's you might remember him a presidential candidate at one stage in the United States

246
00:28:58,81 --> 00:29:11,35
in one thousand nine hundred three for one point five million dollars. It's another twelve ninety seven document.

247
00:29:11,37 --> 00:29:16,27
In two thousand and seven there are solved it.

248
00:29:16,34 --> 00:29:23,64
So an entrepreneur industrialist what have you called David Rubenstein in the United States.

249
00:29:24,32 --> 00:29:32,22
Who has since gifted it to the US National Archives where Rosemarie mentioned it is now held

250
00:29:33,18 --> 00:29:41,95
and having purchased it for one point five million dollars Ross Perot sold it for twenty one point three million

251
00:29:41,96 --> 00:29:49,16
dollars And just to complete that story even though I promised no more advertising.

252
00:29:49,66 --> 00:29:58,94
David Rubenstein has actually done a little essay for all the second edition on on the purchase.

253
00:30:00,2 --> 00:30:12,6
I was looking at that manuscript in a straight yes they obviously became aware of it some point.

254
00:30:12,66 --> 00:30:20,67
Yes I did because you know imagine they could have just said Well sorry that's House.

255
00:30:20,97 --> 00:30:29,42
It's it was part of the deed of gift from the louts family or even know that can't be exported it's us

256
00:30:29,42 --> 00:30:37,25
and Nicholas Prince and goes into those exciting. Negotiations in his he says.
