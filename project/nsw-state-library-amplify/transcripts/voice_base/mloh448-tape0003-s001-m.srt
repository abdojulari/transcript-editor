1
00:00:03,42 --> 00:00:14,5
We will be very sad very narrow right. John.

2
00:00:17,55 --> 00:00:25,00
But I mean I'm sure that happens if you use that language once more but my wife

3
00:00:25,00 --> 00:00:33,36
and I have my you know that very very much in a situation where they should be having fun

4
00:00:33,36 --> 00:00:57,2
and I was on the other hand that it is time to eat a cookie films of well known he was really you know there's no

5
00:00:57,2 --> 00:01:10,61
question he would love to write for us and be right to write while we write. He was sending him to the world.

6
00:01:18,44 --> 00:01:22,19
He was born at home he was really interested.

7
00:01:26,13 --> 00:01:33,04
He was house where he would say when I was interested in what they had to sexually or not

8
00:01:34,03 --> 00:01:49,66
but I did think that he really so sexually with me that a very good bit of a simply world present well I don't even

9
00:01:51,32 --> 00:02:01,47
know whether it was because you know he wasn't at all and I think one reason.

10
00:02:01,49 --> 00:02:13,22
Most of it was actually never something to have sex with a major nation

11
00:02:13,22 --> 00:02:30,88
but I think it was trying to establish that you're right there are probably some people who are right for a few years

12
00:02:30,88 --> 00:02:35,75
when they are status and he's merely a Lavery yet it was a terrible he had a terrible.

13
00:02:35,98 --> 00:02:42,29
I wish I was on holiday on time just consciousness we have so much wrong with me

14
00:02:42,29 --> 00:02:46,83
but are usually a lot of us love as well as I used to go through. I need to get in rushes with me.

15
00:02:46,83 --> 00:02:53,27
That is the thing and I'll be out for all you guys and never seem to include any all out war.

16
00:02:53,38 --> 00:03:00,14
Here he would be interested in anybody who was trying to bring somebody here

17
00:03:00,14 --> 00:03:06,64
and it wouldn't matter if they were eighty five or sixty or if they were for you.

18
00:03:06,66 --> 00:03:15,09
He even knew the symptoms of money never got it right that right by the way they know very well that I have any money

19
00:03:15,09 --> 00:03:17,29
and would like to play them

20
00:03:17,29 --> 00:03:31,81
and he was interested in never never in a situation where you know that because then you have to get his vote again.

21
00:03:31,82 --> 00:03:41,61
Otherwise he's get tell you coming after you tell me if he was trying. The slightest bit interested. He got me.

22
00:03:41,67 --> 00:04:00,87
Well I remember it was going to play this way since I was one of those yellow have seen as it was as if he was.

23
00:04:02,26 --> 00:04:04,81
And you know I was going to back up against the wall

24
00:04:04,81 --> 00:04:14,55
and then eventually you consider yourself Where will you consider the mishandling was when he

25
00:04:14,58 --> 00:04:17,28
when he tired of telling delegates to get into Paris.

26
00:04:17,31 --> 00:04:23,91
I will look it's not it that they have said that was when we were in London. We've seen a lot of quite a few months.

27
00:04:24,21 --> 00:04:31,31
Countless nights are doing what we must we must get there. Harris have a look at you know how to be homeless.

28
00:04:31,32 --> 00:04:32,34
Why just ran out

29
00:04:32,34 --> 00:04:42,43
and I said let's set a date if we put a date said oldest which if I had really wished my leg was a bit scared. Oh.

30
00:04:42,53 --> 00:04:49,67
First of all night. I'm trying to have money not just I was trying to get a job in the theater.

31
00:04:49,68 --> 00:04:56,63
He was more or less trying to get a job in the theater on my own he was still really it was a process that he had

32
00:04:56,63 --> 00:05:00,87
and I would have stuck it all and not a great deal of interest in it

33
00:05:00,87 --> 00:05:07,6
but he used to just write it so you know the just because you can get rid of it in the street that you're a prostitute.

34
00:05:07,63 --> 00:05:20,16
I had taken so I used to do that a lot Johns around the place you know I'm sorry I was saving up for the cameras you

35
00:05:20,16 --> 00:05:26,51
know but I got right now you got to say I did with both got to have the same amount of money you can

36
00:05:26,51 --> 00:05:36,76
and take a small amount of the city on that plane which was a fortune to become a pretty Countess

37
00:05:36,76 --> 00:05:47,86
and I was just trying to she said I recently learned that we were hitchhiking out of the way we were very trying to get

38
00:05:47,86 --> 00:05:58,41
only there a way we charged down by which I mean between lists with Cal because they were going to get that I was like

39
00:05:58,41 --> 00:06:05,67
Drop us a bit you know they are teaching. Yes. And you're on the right and I say do it now. I said I'll get right down.

40
00:06:06,3 --> 00:06:12,02
I said I got exactly how much of you got he said I'm not quite that much.

41
00:06:12,2 --> 00:06:17,19
My mother how much I've got but I have often the very bottom line you is usually here.

42
00:06:17,29 --> 00:06:22,14
My children will be up to date we have to get through immigration.

43
00:06:22,57 --> 00:06:23,38
Here is your house

44
00:06:23,38 --> 00:06:34,9
and the customs at that particular time investigating how much money we're taking you know he said to me how much money

45
00:06:34,9 --> 00:06:44,92
you got the critical trade and you write. You know on the phone and he said John Wright how much of you John.

46
00:06:44,93 --> 00:07:01,51
Rosen and I ten ten years. He's old enough to not only not tell you sir. He said.

47
00:07:01,61 --> 00:07:11,16
Surely you know what his hate to say didn't do it

48
00:07:11,16 --> 00:07:20,66
and he was terrified that was another case which everybody had handed out there at him.

49
00:07:20,67 --> 00:07:32,3
Shyly maintained their usual little brother loved it usually so the Customs man said How long do you intend staying

50
00:07:32,3 --> 00:07:39,84
and how this said trying to rise above the situation said Oh in this.

51
00:07:41,00 --> 00:07:57,85
I'm so I jumped to the best but I do get a little weak. I said my my trade you broke up like it was a little let it go.

52
00:07:57,95 --> 00:08:01,08
You couldn't have got a little bit.

53
00:08:02,24 --> 00:08:13,56
So the crowd here is usually here or maybe the lady had the most of it

54
00:08:13,56 --> 00:08:21,09
or not it was jamming out there now like twenty two. You are painting which I did before.

55
00:08:21,33 --> 00:08:34,13
Yes I know tell me something funny and we can do a sightseeing.

56
00:08:34,37 --> 00:08:43,27
All right so we went where we slept all day and went to the club which was just under fifty years.

57
00:08:43,28 --> 00:08:49,37
Let's face it and I was very different.

58
00:08:49,42 --> 00:09:01,28
The next five years with John commentary would you believe I mean it sounds right.

59
00:09:01,44 --> 00:09:13,58
Living with it was a piece of shit sort of and I can hear you see in those days.

60
00:09:13,72 --> 00:09:37,04
He's like a lot of the period which was a sort of a list of what was there which was great.

61
00:09:37,23 --> 00:09:50,03
Whether you could say there was in the room you call this a you know I don't know I didn't know it well.

62
00:09:50,08 --> 00:09:59,7
Well there I place together there was a verse of that which just off the sounds of the say the rest of the lives of the

63
00:09:59,7 --> 00:10:01,28
right and then to go was.

64
00:10:01,49 --> 00:10:09,22
And that was the festival which was getting a purely and simply gay and it's still running still Gary.

65
00:10:10,29 --> 00:10:15,52
But you just expensive now. Gee station here.

66
00:10:16,43 --> 00:10:25,16
We used to walk in and buy one of the song Take it to the table set of the tables

67
00:10:25,16 --> 00:10:29,55
and I had a great big plate of nuts on a site that was out there

68
00:10:30,04 --> 00:10:35,78
and we just we did eat our way through that it's not like we've moved to another title but need all of that time.

69
00:10:39,15 --> 00:10:40,04
The last time I was in Paris.

70
00:10:40,31 --> 00:10:50,02
I was in for the routine probably the best of our short life there so I thought we're like everyone always tired Gary

71
00:10:50,02 --> 00:10:58,5
and I still that's a strange thing with me if I'm on my own I'm still in the greatest various places like what she

72
00:10:58,5 --> 00:11:06,52
could get carried on for a particular project that he had thought he had back in her region but I still don't.

73
00:11:06,55 --> 00:11:23,6
And I was right to say that or seriously just gas prices you know sort of the ice at night and I thank you very much.

74
00:11:23,73 --> 00:11:46,28
It is the price to get it just over probably a little bit just over there so that you know like you like the idea was

75
00:11:46,28 --> 00:11:55,27
that this is this is all this is all this is laid away just yet that's how I was remember a time

76
00:11:55,27 --> 00:12:00,6
when I was at the cross and I was down I was really about twenty five.

77
00:12:04,79 --> 00:12:18,11
And I was like oh well it was Russia all come out now what we were talking about all of Europe was all about.

78
00:12:18,27 --> 00:12:25,00
We're talking about we're talking about we're talking about the early fifty's

79
00:12:25,00 --> 00:12:39,62
and I was at the section of the cross the that is that cross section right where the valley is now you know not now not

80
00:12:39,62 --> 00:12:45,53
because for sexual abuse to be called Person point it's to call that pension point.

81
00:12:45,67 --> 00:12:49,36
And they used to be a place called the hasty tasty.

82
00:12:49,7 --> 00:12:59,51
You know good old dark place which was unique across in most places we're not over twenty four hours a best way to get

83
00:12:59,51 --> 00:13:11,86
most places enough to tasty used to be saying I'm going to show it was to me the rocky side was on the path.

84
00:13:11,88 --> 00:13:14,97
So this is wrong smelly potential.

85
00:13:14,98 --> 00:13:23,85
Well I never said I was under that smell like and that's exactly what the rock inside was saddled rotten past the hour.

86
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:29,1
While it sounds good. Although not have subsided was a man decides when you know you're beautiful.

87
00:13:29,44 --> 00:13:35,22
This is a very different side of this one that uniform I don't know you got distinction no problem with whether we

88
00:13:35,22 --> 00:13:42,16
should just we're sure he was around that area and it was about night it was light.

89
00:13:42,28 --> 00:13:43,39
About nine o'clock at night

90
00:13:43,39 --> 00:13:57,52
and also this most divine looking Nordic type of Swedish body just the most divine ritual I just I just don't think gas

91
00:13:57,52 --> 00:14:06,81
at his elbow on the on the. Tram stop was a training program running for President Reagan. Yes that's right.

92
00:14:07,17 --> 00:14:13,33
And I saw him and he got on the train partly because he got on the track. I don't know where I was Gary.

93
00:14:13,42 --> 00:14:25,59
But I just followed the man just got off the track and he got off the track. So I got off to an interesting heritage.

94
00:14:27,96 --> 00:14:34,17
But I got off the track and he went up one side street and I followed them.

95
00:14:35,15 --> 00:14:48,1
I mean I was a bit six inches shorter than a great big creature he went to the sideline turned quite deliberately in

96
00:14:48,1 --> 00:14:48,7
the doorway.

97
00:14:48,9 --> 00:14:51,69
So when I came up I had to come straight up to him

98
00:14:51,69 --> 00:15:06,31
and he said Oh I see you are interested in this I think you said it will cost you money.

99
00:15:06,48 --> 00:15:13,43
I said Oh you are but not never had any one citation may cost you money

100
00:15:13,43 --> 00:15:18,16
and people to the occasion said Oh I said Hold on.

101
00:15:19,54 --> 00:15:26,56
Sorry I said I do thank you very much something stupid like that

102
00:15:26,56 --> 00:15:35,83
and I just went off like that because I have to because he was going to want to go off as he was destroying you know

103
00:15:35,83 --> 00:15:49,02
his I think he sounded nice so that was my first introduction to somebody who directly asked me to be any other kind of

104
00:15:49,02 --> 00:15:58,94
people that actually asked me for money but people with life took her it's a rough try that on my life taken me.

105
00:16:02,08 --> 00:16:18,67
It's really more like on a street just Raftery in the street.

106
00:16:19,71 --> 00:16:35,85
See here across the years around that area across like Gary I used to.

107
00:16:35,89 --> 00:16:47,03
I used to like tell me there was a train with no train

108
00:16:47,03 --> 00:16:55,95
and I thought I haven't seen anything before because that's really quick.

109
00:16:55,98 --> 00:17:20,88
Victoria was generally what it was like straight and NOT NOT NOT NOT rough trade in the pick up.

110
00:17:20,9 --> 00:17:24,05
I can show where people.

111
00:17:24,07 --> 00:17:40,6
Where it was mostly only all you get there once or twice

112
00:17:40,6 --> 00:18:01,1
but I was never going to try to get your sight back to where the sailors.

113
00:18:01,76 --> 00:18:07,69
Places in which three dollars raised by the place still live.

114
00:18:07,73 --> 00:18:19,75
It's the final label house he shot her all her life a lot of people some people I know with two Richard B.

115
00:18:19,75 --> 00:18:28,86
Of the street that I got was he going down that direction in his father's rough rough right old bisexual

116
00:18:28,86 --> 00:18:35,48
or he was actually the man is all over the world. You know they're all the possibility.

117
00:18:35,48 --> 00:18:40,02
Yeah you know although the possibility of a lot more danger into it

118
00:18:40,02 --> 00:18:46,54
but I really really had people you know it was fall out.

119
00:18:46,71 --> 00:18:58,46
Yes legacy was going to follow this for years because some people make sure that first of all I think people thought

120
00:18:58,46 --> 00:19:13,79
they had some sort of reputation as a place you're right about with you right.

121
00:19:13,89 --> 00:19:29,38
Well across the Cross facility a place a very early forty years particularly I think people went to become a phony

122
00:19:29,38 --> 00:19:42,3
or coffee shop across that or it's above where the price tree. It was upstairs was a lamp was on the ground zero.

123
00:19:42,3 --> 00:19:44,66
There was not stairs area.

124
00:19:44,82 --> 00:19:55,71
It's not a strip joint downstairs downstairs here but it was the kind of corner Martin that stayed.

125
00:19:55,78 --> 00:20:01,39
It was just a little it was a coffee shop a little bit on the street level and then regular.

126
00:20:04,04 --> 00:20:26,08
About a strong place for really dark history on the left hand side of the front here several joint places.

127
00:20:28,55 --> 00:20:43,7
I think it's possible to where the hotel is the only place where I don't know.

128
00:20:44,88 --> 00:20:55,6
Someone was staring all those days when they but there are also a lot of people here which is also rather similar

129
00:20:55,6 --> 00:21:10,72
or rather sort of like the nearly four year for fifteen years before they would play there was the Kashmir coffee shop

130
00:21:10,72 --> 00:21:11,92
around the corner

131
00:21:11,92 --> 00:21:32,71
and Russell liked to play for one of the sons of the woman that was in the place replaceable trophies

132
00:21:32,71 --> 00:22:12,13
and he had me in Saudi Arabia of the by his mother single shop next door. Like I said right here.

133
00:22:14,06 --> 00:22:31,36
I don't use the cards enough answers because you might write your life

134
00:22:31,36 --> 00:23:00,58
and that was a very very very very procedural very strange run through the end of this of this road where a lot of

135
00:23:01,23 --> 00:23:08,28
people looking back on it's probably pretty true.

136
00:23:10,51 --> 00:23:17,29
Or does it feel like things are as you see in those days the in the right way. Right.

137
00:23:24,43 --> 00:23:59,49
But here we have a very very very unlikely place with nothing to do you guarantee a person I mean are we going to get a

138
00:24:00,06 --> 00:24:01,00
Yes hello.

139
00:24:01,49 --> 00:25:11,58
Yes you're right it probably was a little more action and you know you just take that for you know roughly three three.

140
00:25:16,17 --> 00:25:43,54
But what about the director of writing for sexual director just comparing the percentage of him here is the impression

141
00:25:43,54 --> 00:25:59,54
that people might find out about and any of the other.

142
00:26:01,49 --> 00:26:08,23
From my own inclinations around the school and everything I've noticed out here that just great.

143
00:26:08,23 --> 00:26:13,54
Oh I thought I'd like to raise attention with anybody who was actually wasn't even talked about

144
00:26:13,54 --> 00:26:16,9
or read about in my school night the references to it

145
00:26:16,9 --> 00:26:22,64
but very oblique he didn't just ask you if you have thought about it.

146
00:26:22,75 --> 00:26:28,88
I just find some of these cranks straight to the guys on the roster at school of high round.

147
00:26:28,92 --> 00:26:35,33
We never told about the largest of our well I even got the most of out of but that's just one means of expression

148
00:26:35,33 --> 00:26:47,17
and I just didn't think of this particularly as I have to say but what I was actually as well.

149
00:26:47,19 --> 00:26:49,83
With this thread were well I wouldn't have married

150
00:26:49,83 --> 00:26:53,48
and there's days not that I went to school I was not like down with people running around

151
00:26:53,48 --> 00:27:00,15
and two of them got it clear all year round but with no camp actually it was a narrow your me

152
00:27:00,15 --> 00:27:08,1
but as far as a perceptual join these are just sort of schoolyard slide. Yet I don't think that was either.

153
00:27:08,19 --> 00:27:12,52
It was like any other when I was younger I used to call me girly at school I love it.

154
00:27:12,53 --> 00:27:14,97
That's a good deal because this year old girl appeared.

155
00:27:15,39 --> 00:27:22,87
That's a good early early to let me get off of things very quickly because all right you're to spend all my time with a

156
00:27:22,87 --> 00:27:23,96
very cold rage.

157
00:27:24,07 --> 00:27:30,51
We used to be having it off when I was in grade play Try it for you guys before you tell them off

158
00:27:30,51 --> 00:27:35,65
and they're pulling each other off the kids seem to that they've got a name like.

159
00:27:35,76 --> 00:27:42,75
I've never heard of anybody actually seen me every day was a regular thing I think I'll arrange for you.

160
00:27:42,77 --> 00:27:47,26
Like you wouldn't do for the play each other.

161
00:27:47,33 --> 00:27:58,27
Yeah that was all just messed amazingly messed up but yes I needed that state. I don't know about.

162
00:28:04,55 --> 00:28:16,32
And you know I think the other day here I was on that day.

163
00:28:16,55 --> 00:28:25,38
Jerry I was very struck and there is a good possibility that for quite a while

164
00:28:25,38 --> 00:28:39,24
when I was about thirty first a parable of sexually aware for three fifteen over a baby that even later I thought the

165
00:28:39,27 --> 00:28:43,22
natural way great thing in laboratories

166
00:28:43,68 --> 00:29:02,39
and things like public buildings people would travel around the ready for the areas we used to mother used to go to so

167
00:29:02,39 --> 00:29:06,28
we have to go by trying to come by an unknown.

168
00:29:08,07 --> 00:29:09,59
They used to be this profanity

169
00:29:09,59 --> 00:29:17,19
and then what really fascinated me was to where it gets used to be one of the most popular graffiti is that you see

170
00:29:17,19 --> 00:29:33,08
when you look around what you're just going to get leverage yourself like fax me an invisible hand

171
00:29:33,08 --> 00:29:41,4
and the fact that between a man and a woman was when I put up a woman's bottom line here

172
00:29:42,17 --> 00:29:48,26
and I thought the right of the other way for quite some time to grow thirty forty but I don't know

173
00:29:48,26 --> 00:29:54,44
when we really are beginning to my mother about sixteen before somebody pointed out to me at the right whether

174
00:29:55,13 --> 00:30:01,17
or not just come about because I used to see this big things of stories of right. And so on. So right. You soon.

175
00:30:01,83 --> 00:30:36,16
Right for the more exciting you know from the front that's the front because it's the public toilets have a view of the

176
00:30:36,16 --> 00:30:46,5
hills around the idea of the fucking pole.

177
00:30:52,37 --> 00:31:14,65
You see one of the other things which nothing about the things about when they really think about things like

178
00:31:15,4 --> 00:31:43,3
when they had a front on each other. I mean there was a very very guilty about what I was doing three towns away.

179
00:31:48,96 --> 00:32:01,47
All I can remember of that word for about four days. That really was trying to.

180
00:32:08,68 --> 00:32:11,48
Really when different money or a little bit of it.

181
00:32:11,69 --> 00:32:15,16
Listening to something like a public toilet

182
00:32:15,96 --> 00:32:34,55
or carry just to get help to have a straw in front of me right behind the very or I do it in pictures

183
00:32:34,55 --> 00:33:01,59
and believe anyone approached me around here didn't have sexual experience with no injury to find out about what I

184
00:33:01,59 --> 00:33:08,7
found out to be a part should we be here. Spiritually.

185
00:33:08,74 --> 00:33:12,96
Apart from severe measures like that and they were very early days.

186
00:33:13,17 --> 00:33:23,8
Very nice guy Grant me your area back or somewhere I can make you sick of approaches and I didn't my mouth

187
00:33:23,8 --> 00:33:25,99
or the stomach from that time without my right.

188
00:33:26,11 --> 00:33:35,29
So that was probably because I didn't get really affected types I really think it probably was just the song This is

189
00:33:35,29 --> 00:33:39,93
the thing with me I was always approached by older people always found it very obvious.

190
00:33:40,3 --> 00:33:49,32
Somehow because I was eventually approached by someone that I thought reasonably attractive

191
00:33:49,32 --> 00:34:24,86
but later that I met through. Again. RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT.

192
00:34:25,61 --> 00:35:15,16
Carol phone they are like he put me in the Cold War I was really attracted to people like what you just physically

193
00:35:26,54 --> 00:35:41,68
because this is your life.

194
00:36:07,24 --> 00:36:37,4
Think of the rivers of blood probably a lot less of a Christian one person think it was right because every college is

195
00:36:37,4 --> 00:36:44,45
a great deal and how to play cricket you have to be good at cricket

196
00:36:47,91 --> 00:37:06,17
and if you're good at this that in the way that you really have to be for the popular viewpoint to begin to express an

197
00:37:06,17 --> 00:37:16,81
opinion because Dr Norman here who used to write.

198
00:37:29,27 --> 00:37:39,05
He had a regular weekly column for I was actually discovered there was an actor.

199
00:37:41,59 --> 00:38:00,94
I was I was reading out from e Bay for a lot of years. You met the man.

200
00:38:04,6 --> 00:38:23,44
Come back come back till he came back because he was terrified to come right for me. I mean that particular.

201
00:39:13,77 --> 00:39:52,72
Public already pretty low. Right.

202
00:40:01,95 --> 00:40:17,38
Still someone is manning this young man with his shirt on the chair sort of right down there is here which is about as

203
00:40:17,38 --> 00:40:26,37
direct as you get in those days I just have the strongest hot flash in the world of your do you have your picture of

204
00:40:26,37 --> 00:40:50,15
the story in light of what is it about this race for a lot of people not to middle class.

205
00:40:55,21 --> 00:41:35,09
People actually don't think I mean people who are people like you know about their first novel that I read that really

206
00:41:35,74 --> 00:41:58,24
presented a bang on the first here not you know not here was a particular part of the story where the other woman on

207
00:41:58,24 --> 00:41:58,81
the mouth.

208
00:42:08,46 --> 00:42:46,28
It had an effect on the production of the play which was the first time that I think being treated very

209
00:42:46,28 --> 00:43:39,18
straightforwardly as a long taken from you because in the first act a lot of production in this extraordinary character

210
00:43:59,53 --> 00:44:00,01
wrote quite.

211
00:44:03,12 --> 00:44:16,32
You know he was an actor and he used to do the radio work

212
00:44:16,68 --> 00:44:42,21
but I know because I had access to two radio things at that time radio producer for a time traveler to do with

213
00:44:42,21 --> 00:44:55,43
commercial radio but people were much of course at that time in the profession number of leading radio like.

214
00:45:12,38 --> 00:45:47,08
They were discreet and somewhat like bisexual. Much more. I mean much.

215
00:45:47,46 --> 00:46:02,18
I mean obviously part of it seems to me that even going back in the sixty's was much more much. He said about. Right.

216
00:46:02,71 --> 00:48:01,47
People here in the global war. But polish the trip to Brazil.

217
00:48:07,73 --> 00:48:25,7
That you do the same here yet looking in here you are going to try to you know we can later be over here I just thought

218
00:48:25,7 --> 00:48:29,32
oh my God he's my husband but I mean that you. I've got some of that down.

219
00:48:29,39 --> 00:48:40,25
Have you thought of what we're big sign here is a good way of getting more with us

220
00:48:40,25 --> 00:48:47,36
and the risk to really be feasibly can be far more. There's a war.

221
00:48:47,58 --> 00:49:25,03
Just because they understand that you are willing to share their stories you just go back a story from the book you

222
00:49:25,03 --> 00:49:43,25
will know they're right here. He's the guy that was a recently and very cheap prices because the receipts.

223
00:49:43,43 --> 00:49:58,14
Here was never made with it. There was a question there we all said we were friends today. Oh right yeah yeah yeah.

224
00:49:58,24 --> 00:50:13,86
So it's all done so we end up. That is something I just wrote The Rev Wright.

225
00:50:15,29 --> 00:50:32,42
Yeah right up to the end of the runway I thought was waiting for true love a real word this guy here is in your way

226
00:50:32,75 --> 00:50:45,94
very sorry but like I really really great residential area every day here in Boston last night which scenes are more

227
00:50:45,94 --> 00:50:51,2
or less just nice he takes you around the area with the pick up area.

228
00:50:51,35 --> 00:51:01,33
You literally see standing on the corner you watch his standing on the court just just wait right here.

229
00:51:02,62 --> 00:51:18,29
I never really know you're not sure exactly where there is a very deep right.

230
00:51:20,06 --> 00:51:39,47
This is one of the Russian rows with something like a Range Rover there were letters which are going to get you around

231
00:51:39,47 --> 00:51:59,25
which I should have run off with a boy or look where your great heart is father quite a story.

232
00:52:01,49 --> 00:52:02,75
It was literally straight.

233
00:52:04,18 --> 00:52:19,86
You gave me with that life finally from there was sort of walk around like you're sixty we're actually you guys did

234
00:52:19,86 --> 00:52:33,94
just that right there disappear completely understood what I mean basically or just as if you either.

235
00:52:34,4 --> 00:52:37,16
Never a good job right now

236
00:52:40,14 --> 00:52:49,87
or years highlight will be very very rough for I'm sure you will realize this is the influence of the man who was with

237
00:52:51,23 --> 00:52:57,01
us. But if you wake up you got another cat right here.

238
00:52:58,03 --> 00:53:07,45
Well now you if you want to do that you may enjoy life British racing

239
00:53:07,66 --> 00:53:20,52
or of the cross you wear from well over the Harris County which is down there though you're down there you know the

240
00:53:20,52 --> 00:53:33,61
place straight will with you and because that dark dark street below right. Which is right.

241
00:53:34,83 --> 00:53:53,14
You're going round has every following of the line culture war for you we're talking about you said that you think it

242
00:53:53,14 --> 00:54:05,91
was in the front that there was this was their man. JON STEWART Yes Richard.

243
00:54:08,06 --> 00:54:11,22
This is really just the part to really hear.

244
00:54:15,45 --> 00:54:20,38
Oh yes that was George Bush and the first time wall

245
00:54:20,38 --> 00:54:54,41
and I'm with you especially yesterday about oh joy out of this jury if you're George leg. All right. What was wrong.

246
00:54:55,99 --> 00:55:00,48
Is not really very good here.

247
00:55:01,08 --> 00:55:21,04
It was really it was you know not just share the rescission out there like you know as long as I was aware it was all

248
00:55:22,66 --> 00:55:31,04
about a rush. You know send me to a place the shares were a place to go.

249
00:55:31,08 --> 00:55:54,34
I was here it was a big part of the whole area probably close close to a lot of music shops.

250
00:55:54,41 --> 00:56:03,2
You know very like certainly like here like you know. It will be. Really doing that.

251
00:56:03,22 --> 00:56:26,46
I know I've been so busy trying to be here while he's right there on the road a lot like most of us here you have to

252
00:56:26,46 --> 00:56:34,69
get your child from your place to your swimming cost you something which you don't think you're enough if you really

253
00:56:34,69 --> 00:56:38,33
you know you get by the way if you do you get to get caught

254
00:56:38,33 --> 00:56:43,14
and you can hear if you close your own you change your look

255
00:56:43,14 --> 00:56:52,21
but always there you will leave here with me because you get up here about.

256
00:56:52,24 --> 00:57:00,17
I'm sure the usual kind of the late you mean you should you trust and I sure do.

257
00:57:00,42 --> 00:57:02,08
And then

258
00:57:02,08 --> 00:57:09,08
when you've got drummed out of each year you have to change your route to jail usually because you're so good that

259
00:57:09,08 --> 00:57:27,27
sometimes you live in the Sunday Mirror this is all the more you everyone will lie there without any further on that.

260
00:57:27,36 --> 00:57:39,69
Oh yeah well this happened. Our own relationships a good. Oh yeah.

261
00:57:39,73 --> 00:58:03,48
Are you sure you know how to rock and roll over the years and China Russia. Maybe earlier than that but not. All right.

262
00:58:03,48 --> 00:58:08,02
But I don't think that many people get their drugs and how they will get into the new year.

263
00:58:08,17 --> 00:58:21,5
Here are those sure you're going to find these simple things like Chinese in public like Chinese

264
00:58:21,5 --> 00:58:26,07
or the six o'clock truck really strong. Oh really good.

265
00:58:26,47 --> 00:58:38,05
You see I always do beef this friend of mine who has a drug which you can actually see you know that from the I can

266
00:58:38,05 --> 00:58:48,18
tell you I just am not coming out of the stock cars right straight

267
00:58:48,18 --> 00:58:56,51
and we guessed right from there to this right along this is twenty five to six this night that the earliest we have

268
00:58:56,51 --> 00:58:59,48
well I drink a lot of memory

269
00:58:59,48 --> 00:59:08,88
but there was some people were told you had the only time you had three very five to six for maybe all five of us

270
00:59:08,88 --> 00:59:14,13
probably like you know five or six o'clock to pick up someone.

271
00:59:14,37 --> 00:59:22,9
Oh my goodness you guys are broken hearted that night more likely the younger crowd here we go for a little somewhere

272
00:59:22,9 --> 00:59:27,71
your way to the view. This year.

273
00:59:27,81 --> 00:59:36,64
Yes Let me let me know

274
00:59:36,64 --> 00:59:59,07
when you Google what you just said have you said you should start right there yet it was the year I was in the audience

275
00:59:59,07 --> 01:00:21,12
the one hundred. Because of your small place like Florida you draw a very good meal here and I see tarragon here.

276
01:00:21,75 --> 01:00:36,88
This is a good course he'll be getting but not from the right from the letters

277
01:00:36,88 --> 01:00:46,44
and really really well there really was a new relationship you made your life was a loss of life

278
01:00:47,61 --> 01:00:53,61
but the rest of what was wrong with it was delicious.

279
01:00:55,33 --> 01:01:13,48
But this is not all this is that's just a little scary and you're very very little bit more about this newsgroup.

280
01:01:13,48 --> 01:01:17,11
Gary and our lives let's forget our mother's life.

281
01:01:17,3 --> 01:01:23,38
No not really sad is your goal is this here is a list of services

282
01:01:23,38 --> 01:01:35,9
and it will seem really just sorry bro I can tell you as I said I joined up with that they should try to rewrite it

283
01:01:35,9 --> 01:01:44,7
and it was like a garrison city.

284
01:01:44,93 --> 01:01:52,48
You know I needed to run a really heavy duty free device right here with me right there right.

285
01:01:52,67 --> 01:02:01,22
We were hit by golly some good old trial by the army general market right here. You never changes.

286
01:02:04,3 --> 01:02:13,6
They are and all the rest wrong had been you made into it

287
01:02:14,01 --> 01:02:24,05
but you know you're interesting about all those sort of a very vicious and so I was up there

288
01:02:28,33 --> 01:02:35,69
and what was this little guy.
