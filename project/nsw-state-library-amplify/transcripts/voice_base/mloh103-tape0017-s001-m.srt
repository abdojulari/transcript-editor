1
00:00:13,49 --> 00:00:14,41
Why.

2
00:00:15,37 --> 00:00:21,28
Right.

3
00:00:22,22 --> 00:00:26,34
That's right. That's right.

4
00:00:28,95 --> 00:00:34,17
Ok. My name's eddie booth's.

5
00:00:34,18 --> 00:00:34,75
I'm an architect

6
00:00:36,41 --> 00:00:41,97
and an environmental activist
i suppose you could call me.

7
00:00:42,85 --> 00:00:48,25
I've been living in this area for
18 years. In fact. Arrived here.

8
00:00:49,60 --> 00:00:53,13
The year after the aquarius festival.

9
00:00:54,06 --> 00:00:59,22
We were in fact i was seized during the
aquarius festival travelling through

10
00:00:59,22 --> 00:01:05,22
southeast asia and other places on
to europe and then back again and

11
00:01:05,22 --> 00:01:07,42
when we arrived back from.

12
00:01:08,14 --> 00:01:12,99
From a trip all our friends were telling
us about the aquarius festival.

13
00:01:15,24 --> 00:01:20,22
And prior to are overseas
trip we'd already decided to

14
00:01:22,25 --> 00:01:23,03
get out of sydney.

15
00:01:23,12 --> 00:01:29,26
We were living in sydney i had a practice
architectural practice in sydney and.

16
00:01:29,28 --> 00:01:33,97
I wasn't very satisfied with
my practice or my lifestyle

17
00:01:33,97 --> 00:01:37,58
and we wanted to move into the country.

18
00:01:39,53 --> 00:01:41,57
We felt that we could.

19
00:01:43,21 --> 00:01:44,03
Do some things

20
00:01:44,03 --> 00:01:50,89
that we weren't able to do in the
city basically live a more laid back

21
00:01:50,89 --> 00:01:57,42
lifestyle unpolluted that was
fear. We were living in balmain.

22
00:01:57,44 --> 00:01:59,94
And we had the colgate palmolive factor.

23
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:06,33
You're right next to us which used to belch
huge billowing clouds of black smoke

24
00:02:06,33 --> 00:02:09,13
out every night. Not during
the day only at night.

25
00:02:10,37 --> 00:02:14,72
And we sort of felt we
were suffocating a bit.

26
00:02:14,74 --> 00:02:19,15
Even though it was a pleasant place to
live in balmain in lots of other respects.

27
00:02:19,46 --> 00:02:23,79
So we'd already made up our minds that
we were going to leave the city and

28
00:02:24,55 --> 00:02:26,78
and set up somewhere in the country

29
00:02:26,78 --> 00:02:31,29
but we are no idea where we were going to
in fact travel around australia looking

30
00:02:31,29 --> 00:02:37,10
for a place. So anyway when we
came back from from our seas trip.

31
00:02:37,76 --> 00:02:41,70
As i said before our friends were talking
about their queries first of all

32
00:02:41,70 --> 00:02:48,18
and nimbin so we thought
well we'll check out nimbin

33
00:02:48,18 --> 00:02:50,72
first before we do the rest of australia

34
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:56,07
and so we came while
still living in sydney.

35
00:02:56,21 --> 00:02:58,89
We we made an excursion up here

36
00:03:00,03 --> 00:03:06,04
and sort of fell in love with
the place immediately and.

37
00:03:06,06 --> 00:03:10,06
Found quite a lot of people post aquarius.

38
00:03:10,71 --> 00:03:17,50
People who'd decided to stay on a
timetable and various other places.

39
00:03:17,52 --> 00:03:23,01
And so then we made a
decision there and then

40
00:03:23,01 --> 00:03:26,62
that this was where we'd come to and.

41
00:03:26,64 --> 00:03:32,09
We found a house and land we found

42
00:03:32,09 --> 00:03:37,80
that the house and balmain which we
still owed money on but we found

43
00:03:37,80 --> 00:03:39,20
that we could sell that

44
00:03:39,20 --> 00:03:43,62
and for the proceeds we could buy
this piece of land here in nimbin

45
00:03:44,50 --> 00:03:51,47
and. And we'd have a bit
of change left i would.

46
00:03:51,52 --> 00:03:55,07
Tide us through until
hopefully we got some income.

47
00:03:57,32 --> 00:04:03,84
So that's how we came to be here.
I'm in 1974 the year of the big.

48
00:04:04,50 --> 00:04:06,76
Lismore flood.

49
00:04:07,56 --> 00:04:09,58
All our belongings arrived in lismore

50
00:04:09,58 --> 00:04:16,22
and went into hensley's storage depot
which was perched above the river.

51
00:04:16,75 --> 00:04:21,07
And and the floods came and the
river rose and rose and rose

52
00:04:21,07 --> 00:04:23,47
and we thought our stuff
was going to float away.

53
00:04:23,74 --> 00:04:28,70
It came to within an inch within an
inch of our belongings and then.

54
00:04:29,15 --> 00:04:34,63
Thankfully receded. So that was
our introduction to nimbin wet.

55
00:04:35,04 --> 00:04:39,26
That was the first years were very wet.

56
00:04:39,28 --> 00:04:43,87
The piece of land and the house that
we'd bought already had occupancy in it.

57
00:04:46,93 --> 00:04:52,67
People who'd been renting
or squatting camping.

58
00:04:52,69 --> 00:04:55,18
But we all fitted in very nicely together.

59
00:04:55,83 --> 00:05:02,51
We live we we lived in
shared a house basically.

60
00:05:02,53 --> 00:05:08,47
And. Started life in the country.

61
00:05:08,49 --> 00:05:14,77
We were totally inexperienced we were
charged up with a lot of idealism and.

62
00:05:15,43 --> 00:05:19,29
We had lots of ideas about
what we wanted to see happen

63
00:05:21,54 --> 00:05:26,48
but we had very little eye idea of the
reality of living in the country.

64
00:05:27,23 --> 00:05:31,99
So the first few years were really
discovering what it was all about.

65
00:05:33,70 --> 00:05:37,78
Starting up gardens and orchards.

66
00:05:38,70 --> 00:05:45,43
Rebuilding the house which was barely
livable in was a sort of rundown

67
00:05:45,43 --> 00:05:48,26
country cottage.

68
00:05:48,82 --> 00:05:55,62
But not not one of your classical veranda
places but a jerry built sort of joint.

69
00:05:55,64 --> 00:05:59,68
And so we we started
rebuilding the house and.

70
00:06:02,53 --> 00:06:09,09
And we got involved with what was
then quickly growing community

71
00:06:09,09 --> 00:06:13,00
of new settlers from all over the country.

72
00:06:14,25 --> 00:06:15,60
There were first of all
there were the people

73
00:06:15,60 --> 00:06:19,91
that were left they were from their queries
first of all the ones who didn't even

74
00:06:19,91 --> 00:06:21,03
bother leaving.

75
00:06:21,45 --> 00:06:26,21
Or those who went went away and
reorganize themselves their affairs

76
00:06:26,21 --> 00:06:28,67
and then came back to live here.

77
00:06:28,68 --> 00:06:33,23
And from then on there was a stream
of people coming to the area

78
00:06:33,23 --> 00:06:39,17
and most of us face similar
difficulties housing and

79
00:06:39,17 --> 00:06:41,05
and and schooling

80
00:06:42,23 --> 00:06:47,64
and so probably one of the first community
things we were involved in was.

81
00:06:47,66 --> 00:06:54,01
Setting up the community school
which incidentally still operating.

82
00:06:55,17 --> 00:07:01,79
So that. You know at least their vacation
part was going to be taken care of.

83
00:07:03,45 --> 00:07:04,93
Our daughter.

84
00:07:06,19 --> 00:07:13,11
Was 10 at 10 at the time i think.

85
00:07:14,51 --> 00:07:18,43
And there were lots of other people
who are in a similar situation.

86
00:07:19,05 --> 00:07:24,79
Mainly professionals or students

87
00:07:24,79 --> 00:07:32,43
or you know young graduates very
highly qualified a lot actually.

88
00:07:32,45 --> 00:07:35,72
Refugees from the cities
mainly sydney and melbourne

89
00:07:36,90 --> 00:07:41,30
but other capital cities as well.

90
00:07:41,32 --> 00:07:47,05
And so my first involvement
was the school.

91
00:07:47,07 --> 00:07:53,30
Pretty soon along the way my next
sort of main interest became.

92
00:07:54,26 --> 00:07:59,95
What became known as the home
builders association. Under the.

93
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,08
The circumstances

94
00:08:02,09 --> 00:08:07,13
that we were facing here a lot of people
moved onto vacant blocks of land.

95
00:08:07,99 --> 00:08:14,95
I think that's someone. Well. Right.

96
00:08:15,02 --> 00:08:22,01
So yeah there were wet years
and people fight. Right in.

97
00:08:22,12 --> 00:08:28,98
So in the 70s in the early 70s as
people were writhing here they were

98
00:08:28,98 --> 00:08:29,84
finding that.

99
00:08:31,44 --> 00:08:36,20
Often they were moving on to they
can pieces of land buying land

100
00:08:36,20 --> 00:08:38,05
and buying into communities

101
00:08:38,05 --> 00:08:43,56
and there was no housing for them
so they had pictured 10 and.

102
00:08:43,58 --> 00:08:47,17
And very rudimentary shelters and and.

103
00:08:48,78 --> 00:08:51,99
Try and cope with the weather
the leaches and the ticks and

104
00:08:53,03 --> 00:08:58,35
and all the rest of it and so shelter
became a very important first step.

105
00:08:58,90 --> 00:09:05,58
Getting them getting set up so that
you were out of the weather. And. So.

106
00:09:06,94 --> 00:09:12,40
People generally came
with very little capital.

107
00:09:13,12 --> 00:09:16,10
They couldn't afford to get
someone to build them a house

108
00:09:16,10 --> 00:09:20,12
that was almost always
totally out of the question.

109
00:09:20,93 --> 00:09:27,07
So what people did was they
became owner builders they.

110
00:09:27,91 --> 00:09:32,40
Bought and scavenged materials
bought second hand stuff

111
00:09:32,40 --> 00:09:35,03
and scavenged it wherever
they could find it

112
00:09:35,77 --> 00:09:42,75
and used poles and. You
know which they did.

113
00:09:43,09 --> 00:09:49,55
They'd cut trees. On their properties.

114
00:09:50,26 --> 00:09:55,78
And they use these materials
to put up their houses. Now.

115
00:09:56,33 --> 00:10:01,71
And they were very innovative
and. Very interesting ha's it's.

116
00:10:02,11 --> 00:10:05,83
However the castle didn't
find them innovative

117
00:10:05,83 --> 00:10:12,17
or interesting they found a total
affront to their regulations.

118
00:10:12,19 --> 00:10:17,60
And. So.

119
00:10:18,63 --> 00:10:23,37
While for quite a while they turned a blind
eye because they didn't really know how

120
00:10:23,37 --> 00:10:26,08
to cope with it.

121
00:10:27,14 --> 00:10:34,85
But then there was a police
raid on a on a property.

122
00:10:35,61 --> 00:10:40,43
The rainier way or any of the
wallace road actually and.

123
00:10:41,07 --> 00:10:43,91
It was to do with marijuana. And.

124
00:10:45,32 --> 00:10:47,99
I can't remember whether there
were drugs on the place or not

125
00:10:47,99 --> 00:10:54,20
but as a result of it. The police
made a complaint to the council.

126
00:10:55,02 --> 00:10:59,33
Saying that this property had more
buildings on it than were permitted.

127
00:11:00,05 --> 00:11:02,40
And because of the police complaint

128
00:11:02,40 --> 00:11:07,29
that the council was obliged to send
their inspectors out which they did

129
00:11:07,29 --> 00:11:13,46
and the inspectors inspected
the buildings. And it was.

130
00:11:14,50 --> 00:11:14,79
They found

131
00:11:14,79 --> 00:11:20,02
that there were three three more buildings
on the site than were allowed and

132
00:11:20,02 --> 00:11:25,24
that the buildings didn't comply with
regulations in various ways you know maybe

133
00:11:25,24 --> 00:11:27,07
the ceiling height wasn't quite right

134
00:11:27,07 --> 00:11:32,85
or they might have had a loft in
them which in those days lofts were

135
00:11:32,85 --> 00:11:38,26
recognised. And so.

136
00:11:39,10 --> 00:11:46,06
They asked the owners of the
property to demolish the excess

137
00:11:46,06 --> 00:11:51,04
houses and fix up what was
left to meet regulations.

138
00:11:51,06 --> 00:11:54,49
Now these people weren't prepared to do

139
00:11:54,49 --> 00:11:59,37
that they'd put a lot of love an effort
into building their shelters and.

140
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:06,95
Had no intention of
demolishing any of them.

141
00:12:07,82 --> 00:12:11,13
And eventually things came to a
head they had a number of warnings

142
00:12:11,13 --> 00:12:15,56
and then the next thing was the council
issued them with a demolition order which

143
00:12:15,56 --> 00:12:20,78
said if you don't demolish we're
going to come out and do it for you.

144
00:12:21,72 --> 00:12:25,16
Well they they got in touch with friends

145
00:12:25,16 --> 00:12:31,91
and pretty soon the network of new settlers
in the area were alerted to what was

146
00:12:31,91 --> 00:12:36,00
about to happen and most of us were
in very similar circumstances.

147
00:12:36,96 --> 00:12:42,81
So we had a meeting in the in the media
centre which is where we are now.

148
00:12:43,99 --> 00:12:45,40
And a hundred people turned up

149
00:12:46,87 --> 00:12:54,49
and we formed the home builders association
which was initially it was formed to.

150
00:12:56,36 --> 00:12:58,92
To stop council from going
ahead with the demolition.

151
00:13:00,04 --> 00:13:05,06
And then grew to be an organisation
that generally fostered

152
00:13:05,07 --> 00:13:11,35
and assisted the process of
home building in the area.

153
00:13:11,37 --> 00:13:17,21
Did a lot of community projects we
organise work gangs work days on various

154
00:13:17,21 --> 00:13:20,40
properties put up places and.

155
00:13:21,83 --> 00:13:23,16
Add facilities and so on

156
00:13:24,18 --> 00:13:31,76
and we opened negotiations
with it with the council.

157
00:13:31,78 --> 00:13:37,96
And so. A group of us.

158
00:13:37,97 --> 00:13:41,99
Carry these negotiations on with
council for quite a number of years.

159
00:13:42,39 --> 00:13:47,96
No buildings wherever demolished and.

160
00:13:47,98 --> 00:13:56,44
Gradually we we convinced council with
the systems of the state government.

161
00:13:56,46 --> 00:13:59,79
Excuse me who were very.

162
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,96
Sympathetic to our cause and
i'll come to that in a minute.

163
00:14:05,33 --> 00:14:11,61
With this instance of the state
government we we have we got implemented

164
00:14:12,44 --> 00:14:18,28
multiple occupancy planning
regulations which.

165
00:14:18,30 --> 00:14:22,52
Recognized more than the
prescribed number of buildings.

166
00:14:24,28 --> 00:14:30,80
Acreage that. That was in the in the
in the regulations at that time.

167
00:14:31,40 --> 00:14:36,94
Recognize the need allowed
more buildings and.

168
00:14:37,75 --> 00:14:44,38
And we also started to get
council loosened up on some of

169
00:14:44,38 --> 00:14:51,17
their interpretations of building bylaws
as as regards materials things like

170
00:14:51,17 --> 00:14:53,10
mud brick.

171
00:14:53,12 --> 00:14:57,59
Recycled material pole
frames and stuff like that

172
00:14:57,59 --> 00:15:04,54
and also we we got them
to recognize a lot of by.

173
00:15:05,30 --> 00:15:08,47
We were allowed to build
lofts because we had

174
00:15:08,47 --> 00:15:13,71
but we had to call them storage
spaces. But then we'd sleep in them.

175
00:15:13,84 --> 00:15:20,62
And i think nimbin sort of pioneered
the loft we you know there are so

176
00:15:20,62 --> 00:15:21,29
many houses

177
00:15:21,29 --> 00:15:29,21
that we lofts in them because they're
very handy way of utilizing space.

178
00:15:29,23 --> 00:15:33,77
I mean we had to confront them on a whole
range of building issues you know for

179
00:15:33,77 --> 00:15:38,22
instance it was one house
that didn't have a wall.

180
00:15:39,48 --> 00:15:45,17
Now as far as the council's concerned
you cannot have a house without a wall.

181
00:15:45,19 --> 00:15:47,50
You must have a wall.

182
00:15:48,61 --> 00:15:53,22
So when when is a wall a wall
and when is a blank space or

183
00:15:54,53 --> 00:15:59,90
or a tree or or. A vine.
When does that because.

184
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,05
I'm a wall an enclosed
space. So we had these.

185
00:16:04,07 --> 00:16:11,79
Ridiculous arguments with them
about matters of the hour.

186
00:16:11,80 --> 00:16:18,58
During all this time we had
terrific input from people in

187
00:16:18,58 --> 00:16:24,21
sydney university and.

188
00:16:24,23 --> 00:16:29,94
They helped us with the whole process
of getting multiple occupancy happening

189
00:16:29,94 --> 00:16:32,23
and the loosening up of the regulations

190
00:16:32,23 --> 00:16:37,05
and recognition of other building forms
other than the normal ones the council was

191
00:16:37,05 --> 00:16:42,42
used to so.

192
00:16:42,44 --> 00:16:48,22
Let's see. I've got to i've
got to draw my breath. Going.

193
00:16:49,35 --> 00:16:53,90
So now we had a lot of help
from the state government.

194
00:16:53,92 --> 00:16:59,05
And at that time it was neville
wran and the labor government

195
00:17:00,34 --> 00:17:05,00
and then and there was a
particularly sympathetic minister.

196
00:17:05,40 --> 00:17:07,48
For planning for land.

197
00:17:07,85 --> 00:17:13,82
Unfortunately died a few
years ago a young man.

198
00:17:13,83 --> 00:17:19,14
And. He was he was.

199
00:17:19,16 --> 00:17:23,66
Quite enthusiastic about what we
were doing and very supportive.

200
00:17:25,12 --> 00:17:30,46
So he helped change the
state planning laws.

201
00:17:31,58 --> 00:17:34,19
Paul land it was also involved in.

202
00:17:36,87 --> 00:17:40,65
Another matter of great
interest to us at the time.

203
00:17:40,83 --> 00:17:41,42
And

204
00:17:42,82 --> 00:17:48,85
and this is this is my other one of my
other great passions if you can call it

205
00:17:48,85 --> 00:17:54,85
that. Which relates to
the environment. Now.

206
00:17:56,48 --> 00:18:02,22
In in the early in the midst. Even these.

207
00:18:02,23 --> 00:18:06,74
A group of new settlers in terrain here.

208
00:18:06,76 --> 00:18:08,03
Became aware

209
00:18:08,03 --> 00:18:14,76
that the forest at the end of their
valley the virgin rainforest

210
00:18:14,76 --> 00:18:20,18
that there in the end of their
daily was about to be logged.

211
00:18:20,20 --> 00:18:26,94
And they began to organize resistance
to it generally trying to persuade the

212
00:18:26,94 --> 00:18:33,20
forestry commission of the following
folly of that course of action.

213
00:18:33,22 --> 00:18:39,54
They weren't successful the forestry
commission is pretty intractable now in those

214
00:18:39,54 --> 00:18:42,35
days they were totally
a law unto themselves

215
00:18:43,66 --> 00:18:49,64
and weren't into any public
input whatsoever. So.

216
00:18:51,27 --> 00:18:58,70
They were unsuccessful their campaign went
on for a number of years until in 1979.

217
00:18:58,72 --> 00:19:01,21
The bulldozers started moving in.

218
00:19:04,67 --> 00:19:09,94
Again this network of
people was alerted and.

219
00:19:10,62 --> 00:19:15,47
Hundreds of us from around the
valleys nearby to rainier

220
00:19:15,47 --> 00:19:19,42
and the people into rainier itself.

221
00:19:19,43 --> 00:19:25,71
Went to the forest and
blockaded the bulldozers.

222
00:19:26,90 --> 00:19:31,25
I think most people have
probably heard about rainier.

223
00:19:31,27 --> 00:19:37,71
And it was probably the first major
environmental direct action in

224
00:19:37,71 --> 00:19:41,78
australia. And it set the pace and

225
00:19:41,78 --> 00:19:48,43
and the style of many future
environmental actions

226
00:19:50,66 --> 00:19:53,17
for me it was a real.

227
00:19:55,17 --> 00:20:00,63
I opened because i'd been aware of
rainforests when i'm. Moved up here.

228
00:20:00,88 --> 00:20:04,63
I became aware of rainforests
they were you know around us

229
00:20:04,63 --> 00:20:09,05
and i'd sort of had a look here and there.

230
00:20:09,89 --> 00:20:16,16
But i didn't really know what they
were about and the terrain here.

231
00:20:16,45 --> 00:20:19,34
Protest. Really.

232
00:20:23,21 --> 00:20:29,12
Crystallized all these environmental
concerns because here was he was a

233
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:36,71
rainforest which i discovered was one of
the most cop complex ecosystems on the

234
00:20:36,71 --> 00:20:39,70
planet.

235
00:20:39,72 --> 00:20:44,65
With an amazing diversity
of flora and fauna.

236
00:20:45,85 --> 00:20:48,07
We lived in the forest
during this protest.

237
00:20:48,40 --> 00:20:52,87
We were there all the time we were
in and out we were up and down trees

238
00:20:52,87 --> 00:20:57,58
and we were in front of the bulldozers
and we were running off into the forest

239
00:20:57,58 --> 00:21:01,11
and playing chasing us
with the police and.

240
00:21:02,36 --> 00:21:05,26
And this went on for a number of weeks.

241
00:21:05,28 --> 00:21:12,06
So there was a there was this
mass conversion of people to

242
00:21:12,89 --> 00:21:18,92
the defence of the rainforest people just
really got turned on to what rainforest

243
00:21:18,92 --> 00:21:24,91
was about. And. And for me it.

244
00:21:24,93 --> 00:21:30,52
It led to an involvement in
rainforest protection from

245
00:21:30,53 --> 00:21:35,96
that time onwards.

246
00:21:35,97 --> 00:21:41,26
And poor land that was. I started this
off by saying poor land was involved.

247
00:21:41,51 --> 00:21:44,28
Well poor land again.

248
00:21:44,30 --> 00:21:50,06
Gave support to the two are.

249
00:21:50,81 --> 00:21:56,70
Our pleas for protecting the forest
and well this is history now

250
00:21:57,44 --> 00:22:04,27
that the logging was stopped.
An enquiry was set up.

251
00:22:05,40 --> 00:22:08,50
Which dragged on for a year
and spent a million dollars

252
00:22:08,50 --> 00:22:14,57
and was never really used the results
of it were never really used by

253
00:22:14,58 --> 00:22:19,26
that time other events caught
up with with three ania.

254
00:22:19,68 --> 00:22:24,26
And. Fairly soon after.

255
00:22:26,22 --> 00:22:29,17
All those areas became part of.

256
00:22:30,62 --> 00:22:36,68
What eventually became world
heritage areas. In 1982.

257
00:22:36,81 --> 00:22:37,96
There was a similar.

258
00:22:38,29 --> 00:23:02,43
Similar forest protest here
in the nightcap range.

259
00:23:03,72 --> 00:23:09,67
Well i think it did i think it
did not. Well nimbin nimbin.

260
00:23:10,94 --> 00:23:17,35
You could say became the front
line of environmental defense.

261
00:23:19,38 --> 00:23:25,72
Of the terrain a protest came other
similar protests. The nightcap.

262
00:23:26,10 --> 00:23:30,41
Range middle head beach.

263
00:23:30,80 --> 00:23:35,23
This was this wasn't the rainforest forest
matter this was sand mining a virgin.

264
00:23:36,60 --> 00:23:42,26
Beach on the on the north coast.

265
00:23:42,28 --> 00:23:47,55
But it was again it was driven
by the protest was driven by.

266
00:23:48,49 --> 00:23:49,29
Concern

267
00:23:50,15 --> 00:23:58,11
that here was a pristine environment
being destroyed for short term profit.

268
00:23:59,20 --> 00:24:05,99
And im. I mean they were also. They were
extracting minerals which were going into.

269
00:24:06,00 --> 00:24:07,89
Atomic warheads and so on.

270
00:24:07,97 --> 00:24:12,38
So there were all these other aspects
involved and we were very much against

271
00:24:12,38 --> 00:24:19,28
that that campaign incidentally was
lost the beach of the beach was mine.

272
00:24:19,33 --> 00:24:21,42
The forests of the.

273
00:24:22,09 --> 00:24:24,52
The forest and

274
00:24:24,53 --> 00:24:30,67
that you as with destroyed.

275
00:24:31,91 --> 00:24:36,98
Also in 1982. While the nightcap
protests this happening.

276
00:24:37,45 --> 00:24:42,74
Tasmanian tasmania. The.

277
00:24:43,73 --> 00:24:49,07
The franklin was under threat

278
00:24:50,73 --> 00:24:55,69
and the tasmanian environmentalists were
starting to get organised to see what they

279
00:24:55,69 --> 00:24:58,70
could do and they were very
interested in what we were doing here

280
00:24:59,78 --> 00:25:04,81
and they sent representatives here to
talk to us and see what we were doing

281
00:25:05,82 --> 00:25:13,55
and we kept in constant
touch until until in.

282
00:25:14,33 --> 00:25:21,17
Must be in late 1980 to work started

283
00:25:21,17 --> 00:25:24,49
on the franklin and the
blockade of the franklin began.

284
00:25:26,59 --> 00:25:29,99
And many people from here.

285
00:25:32,16 --> 00:25:38,87
Well perhaps like myself.
They. Packed their kids.

286
00:25:39,86 --> 00:25:43,40
A few belongings into comedy
vans and other vehicles

287
00:25:44,41 --> 00:25:47,17
and made the trek down to tassie.

288
00:25:47,18 --> 00:25:52,62
And then spent three months on the river.

289
00:25:54,04 --> 00:25:59,68
And we we had we had a lot to offer.

290
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:06,34
Well we were expecting the sort of
front line if you like to call it

291
00:26:06,34 --> 00:26:10,58
that we were we went to the
blockade on the river.

292
00:26:11,79 --> 00:26:15,70
The tasmanian wilderness
society organised the rest.

293
00:26:15,84 --> 00:26:21,78
They they got the boats together they trained
people in nonviolent action they had

294
00:26:21,78 --> 00:26:26,31
camps they organized supply and
lines radio communications.

295
00:26:27,33 --> 00:26:32,37
It was a beautifully done. Job. And.

296
00:26:32,39 --> 00:26:39,38
We did our part by doing the work upfront.

297
00:26:41,87 --> 00:26:47,44
With the police and the workers and and
the barges that came up the river.

298
00:26:48,94 --> 00:26:55,46
And of course educated and another
generation almost you could say of.

299
00:26:56,01 --> 00:27:00,13
Of young australians.

300
00:27:00,15 --> 00:27:02,50
Because it was it was holiday time

301
00:27:02,50 --> 00:27:07,90
and students from all over the country
came to help with the blockade.

302
00:27:07,92 --> 00:27:14,87
And we they had this crash course
of environmental awareness

303
00:27:14,88 --> 00:27:21,08
and environmental action.
And of course then.

304
00:27:21,64 --> 00:27:29,97
That campaign went on to 1983.

305
00:27:31,43 --> 00:27:34,64
Until the labour government one office

306
00:27:36,02 --> 00:27:41,29
and put a stop to. Well they didn't
actually quite put a stop to it but.

307
00:27:41,65 --> 00:27:44,93
Signalled their intention to stop work.

308
00:27:46,15 --> 00:27:51,50
And there was followed a protracted legal
process in the high court eventually

309
00:27:51,50 --> 00:27:56,87
stopping. The destruction
of the destruction.

310
00:27:58,31 --> 00:27:59,29
Can we pause for a minute.

311
00:28:02,64 --> 00:28:20,14
Yes.

312
00:28:21,16 --> 00:28:27,21
Quite true. I hope. You are right.
Well i think it's quite true that.

313
00:28:28,56 --> 00:28:32,95
Nimbin has been. The breeding
ground of green extremists.

314
00:28:33,08 --> 00:28:33,41
Yes

315
00:28:33,41 --> 00:28:40,92
and i think that's one of its major
contributions to strain in society.

316
00:28:43,77 --> 00:28:48,88
I mean if you look back. If you look
now the 20 years since aquarius.

317
00:28:49,29 --> 00:28:52,03
There's been an enormous leap in.

318
00:28:52,61 --> 00:28:55,85
Environmental awareness
throughout the whole country.

319
00:28:56,42 --> 00:28:59,08
It's now mainstream that awareness.

320
00:29:00,46 --> 00:29:05,87
It wasn't there 20 years ago and and i
think nimbin played a very people in them

321
00:29:05,87 --> 00:29:12,74
and played. Played a major role in
getting that awareness happening.

322
00:29:12,99 --> 00:29:19,15
And continuing it. And i hope will
continue to play a role in the future.

323
00:29:21,81 --> 00:29:23,11
So yes.

324
00:29:24,38 --> 00:29:29,90
There they can be labelled as extreme
as we can be labeled as extremists

325
00:29:29,90 --> 00:29:30,66
but we feel

326
00:29:30,66 --> 00:29:38,04
that these are extreme times i mean
what we saw was it was unbridled

327
00:29:38,82 --> 00:29:44,07
exploitation of of resources
natural resources which.

328
00:29:44,51 --> 00:29:49,70
Really the commonwealth. They're
not there to be taken by.

329
00:29:50,25 --> 00:29:53,82
Vested interests someone out
there for a quick buck.

330
00:29:53,96 --> 00:29:58,01
They belong to all of us
they belong to our children.

331
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,82
And we weren't prepared
to stand by and and.

332
00:30:05,17 --> 00:30:10,49
You know see see them pillaged and raped.

333
00:30:10,50 --> 00:30:17,43
Absolutely no apologies. Big thing.

334
00:30:17,47 --> 00:30:18,76
There's a lot.

335
00:30:20,77 --> 00:30:24,72
So the vision the vision.

336
00:30:24,74 --> 00:30:26,69
You know 20 years ago and

337
00:30:26,69 --> 00:30:33,23
and the years since then broadway eaves
of new settlers all bringing their

338
00:30:33,23 --> 00:30:35,62
ideals and visions for the for the.

339
00:30:36,04 --> 00:30:36,98
For the future

340
00:30:38,65 --> 00:30:43,53
and i've mentioned.

341
00:30:44,77 --> 00:30:49,19
I've mentioned home building
and then via im and as.

342
00:30:49,21 --> 00:30:53,16
Some of the things that
people got involved in.

343
00:30:56,41 --> 00:31:02,54
Well there were lots of other visions they
really spread across the whole spectrum

344
00:31:02,55 --> 00:31:05,26
of human activity and endeavor.

345
00:31:06,44 --> 00:31:11,85
And and ranging from home birth.

346
00:31:11,93 --> 00:31:18,85
For instance birthing. We
wanted to see are kids born.

347
00:31:20,51 --> 00:31:26,90
In a dress free nonclinical
thing environment. So.

348
00:31:28,31 --> 00:31:29,10
