1
00:00:18,94 --> 00:00:24,66
Oh yes our children grew up with the children
around the area although we are about

2
00:00:24,66 --> 00:00:26,18
six kilometres out of nimbin

3
00:00:27,17 --> 00:00:32,76
and our children attended the copic camp
local school here donna our youngest girl

4
00:00:32,76 --> 00:00:37,95
did go to newbern high school
and they were they played sport

5
00:00:37,95 --> 00:00:43,84
and everything in nimbin with and against
the local or the alternate children

6
00:00:43,84 --> 00:00:49,30
and there was no problems and i think
the children are the main thing

7
00:00:49,30 --> 00:00:54,69
that we've got to look at for to assimilate
both groups into a better functioning

8
00:00:54,70 --> 00:01:05,82
community.

9
00:01:06,97 --> 00:01:09,66
Oh yeah there's been some low
points and hope oints ian.

10
00:01:09,83 --> 00:01:16,26
Yeah some of the low points have been.
Some of the and a very small percentage.

11
00:01:16,60 --> 00:01:21,49
I've got to emphasize of the alternate
are extremists and when it comes to.

12
00:01:22,16 --> 00:01:24,32
Such a the local just lately

13
00:01:24,32 --> 00:01:29,87
and the storage of just being in installed
now we've had great arguments against it.

14
00:01:30,09 --> 00:01:31,42
I we've had community consultation

15
00:01:32,73 --> 00:01:39,22
and unfortunately these extremist will not
accept a democratic vote in other words

16
00:01:39,22 --> 00:01:43,09
a majority vote and i still
campaigning against it

17
00:01:43,09 --> 00:01:47,57
and we've had the situation where one
of them's even said that when the cert

18
00:01:47,57 --> 00:01:50,23
when the public toilet will be filled
with cement. When it is finished.

19
00:01:50,44 --> 00:01:53,06
Oh that's some of the low
points but the high points are

20
00:01:53,06 --> 00:01:57,80
when they alternate themselves are
taking part in community affairs

21
00:01:57,80 --> 00:01:59,92
and i mean the community.

22
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,21
If air such as progress associations
ratepayers associations

23
00:02:03,21 --> 00:02:06,90
and taking an active part in
the community affairs and

24
00:02:06,91 --> 00:02:09,22
that is the biggest proportion of them

25
00:02:09,22 --> 00:02:14,03
and they do not want
the extremists at all.

26
00:02:14,87 --> 00:02:18,50
They would rather do without them and.

27
00:02:18,51 --> 00:02:24,84
It is a situation where i think the high
point really outweigh the low points and.

28
00:02:25,59 --> 00:02:34,74
I'm happy to be a member of the
newman community i can assure you.

29
00:02:37,25 --> 00:02:37,58
Yes i

30
00:02:37,58 --> 00:02:42,87
and i think that's probably one of the worst
situations of the disadvantages probably

31
00:02:42,87 --> 00:02:48,47
of the aquarius first of all it's stigmatized
the village as a hippie capital of

32
00:02:48,47 --> 00:02:52,88
australia. Not only the state and
that is something i don't think

33
00:02:52,88 --> 00:02:55,54
that the community will ever live down.

34
00:02:56,92 --> 00:02:59,91
It is something that as i mentioned
a while ago the alternative.

35
00:02:59,93 --> 00:03:01,84
Don't even want that
stigmatized in that way.

36
00:03:02,87 --> 00:03:06,04
I think the other down
want is the the drug scene

37
00:03:06,04 --> 00:03:07,91
that did follow the aquarius best of all

38
00:03:07,91 --> 00:03:12,02
and i suppose it can't all be blamed
on it but it's damp from that time

39
00:03:12,02 --> 00:03:16,51
and it's a problem that's going
to take a lot to overcome it.

40
00:03:17,76 --> 00:03:19,24
There are quite a few.

41
00:03:20,12 --> 00:03:24,71
Achim organisations in the community at
the present stage campaigning with the

42
00:03:24,71 --> 00:03:26,10
police and the local state

43
00:03:26,10 --> 00:03:29,69
and federal government to try to do something
about it to clean it up the street

44
00:03:29,69 --> 00:03:33,68
scene is not very very good at all
of the president stage and i think

45
00:03:33,68 --> 00:03:36,26
that is the one bad thing really

46
00:03:36,26 --> 00:03:41,37
that came from as well as dig my toes
asian it came from the queers festival

47
00:03:41,37 --> 00:03:49,97
that it's going take a lot to live down.

48
00:03:51,69 --> 00:03:54,54
Well it's got the image that
if you want an easy life

49
00:03:54,54 --> 00:03:59,90
or something like you come
to newman it's there. And.

50
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,06
Oh.

51
00:04:02,08 --> 00:04:06,39
I live far enough out of newman not to
be caught up in a too much as i said six

52
00:04:06,39 --> 00:04:10,84
kilometres away but it is not good
on the street at the present stage

53
00:04:11,69 --> 00:04:13,20
and i think the developers

54
00:04:13,20 --> 00:04:17,09
that are developing around neumann at the
present stage are coming in contact with

55
00:04:17,09 --> 00:04:19,46
this when they're trying
to sell properties

56
00:04:19,46 --> 00:04:25,09
when they're trying to sell blocks for
building. They're coming against a.

57
00:04:25,11 --> 00:04:28,66
A little bit of animosity or.

58
00:04:29,46 --> 00:04:33,25
Rebellion would be the wrong word
against buying a block in nimbin

59
00:04:33,25 --> 00:04:36,28
and that's one of the things that
i think it's got to be overcome

60
00:04:36,28 --> 00:04:42,34
and it'll need a lot of work by the alternate
by the local community to overcome

61
00:04:42,34 --> 00:04:42,76
all these problems

62
00:04:42,76 --> 00:04:51,96
but i think it can be done.

63
00:04:51,98 --> 00:04:57,79
Only the extremist not
wanting any change the.

64
00:04:57,81 --> 00:05:04,28
The majority of the alternative side you
most certainly don't mind any great change

65
00:05:04,28 --> 00:05:08,87
providing the environment is looked after
providing all the ordinances of the

66
00:05:08,87 --> 00:05:13,63
council are abided by the doesn't
seem to be any problem with them

67
00:05:13,63 --> 00:05:16,28
but there is a a section

68
00:05:16,28 --> 00:05:22,68
and i said the the extremists don't want
any change whatever an even campaign at a

69
00:05:22,68 --> 00:05:24,07
local auction or something like that

70
00:05:24,07 --> 00:05:37,57
and tell people not to buy.

71
00:05:37,59 --> 00:05:38,93
Probably the most things

72
00:05:38,93 --> 00:05:44,97
that i've had complaints against
the the extremists i would be the

73
00:05:44,97 --> 00:05:49,44
situation with multiple
occupancies on properties

74
00:05:49,44 --> 00:05:56,37
and on my time on council that
i've had. Lots of problems.

75
00:05:56,39 --> 00:06:00,26
I've got nothing against
multiple occupancy. At all.

76
00:06:00,66 --> 00:06:01,24
Providing

77
00:06:01,24 --> 00:06:07,09
that they have got community titles
providing all the ordinance of counsellor

78
00:06:07,09 --> 00:06:07,61
abided by

79
00:06:08,57 --> 00:06:13,80
and all the recommendations laid down for
fire control for environment control are

80
00:06:13,80 --> 00:06:18,94
abided by exactly the same as any
other developers required to do that.

81
00:06:19,01 --> 00:06:23,74
Unfortunately has not been done by a lot
of the multiple occupancy in the area.

82
00:06:23,81 --> 00:06:29,56
Now there are. In the police
district 67 multiple occupancies.

83
00:06:31,28 --> 00:06:34,18
They're not all legal some have been done
the council don't even know anything

84
00:06:34,18 --> 00:06:34,69
about them.

85
00:06:34,81 --> 00:06:39,91
So we've got a real big problem as far as
multiboot i couldn't read a concern some

86
00:06:39,92 --> 00:06:42,64
of which are legal and
some of which are working

87
00:06:42,64 --> 00:06:46,50
and functioning exceptionally well and
i've got no problem with them at all

88
00:06:47,43 --> 00:06:50,58
but i certainly have a
problem with any of the ones

89
00:06:50,58 --> 00:06:56,42
that are not abiding by counseled ordinances.
They're building codes. They held.

90
00:06:57,91 --> 00:07:13,99
Provisions for the for the safeguard
of the environment of the community.

91
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:19,95
Well history need multiple i can
go right away back to 1973 74.

92
00:07:21,71 --> 00:07:25,73
When a tunnel falls coordination cooperative
come into being with the drainage i

93
00:07:25,73 --> 00:07:30,33
counsel it will the first one on the i think
the whole of the north east corner at

94
00:07:30,33 --> 00:07:35,22
least of the state of new south wales
and it was like a guinea pig and.

95
00:07:35,24 --> 00:07:36,98
I have being a councillor on the council

96
00:07:36,98 --> 00:07:41,67
that time had a job to
come to grips with it and.

97
00:07:42,70 --> 00:07:48,86
It got off the ground not unanimous vote
by the sticks councillors on the council

98
00:07:49,96 --> 00:07:53,40
but the main thing that swayed do
majority of the council were they said

99
00:07:53,40 --> 00:07:55,62
that they want to do their own
thing and look after themselves.

100
00:07:56,13 --> 00:07:59,93
Don't take any part in community
affairs and have no problem.

101
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,70
They're and they want to do their
own thing and get all that old.

102
00:08:02,71 --> 00:08:05,30
Now that's why the whole
council not the whole council

103
00:08:05,30 --> 00:08:08,15
but the majority of council
to vote to let it go ahead.

104
00:08:08,81 --> 00:08:15,69
Since that time we've had a history of
multiple occupancy and. The council.

105
00:08:16,64 --> 00:08:22,78
It has been fragmented. A whole lot
there's been a legal buildings go up.

106
00:08:22,81 --> 00:08:26,70
There's been threats of of taking
them down with the bulldozer.

107
00:08:27,54 --> 00:08:30,80
We have the ombudsman it step in
a couple of occasions we've had.

108
00:08:32,12 --> 00:08:35,31
Ministers of the state stepping
in on terrible occasions

109
00:08:35,31 --> 00:08:42,02
and there have not been a
good liaison between building

110
00:08:42,03 --> 00:08:45,54
codes health regulations
with multiple occupancies

111
00:08:45,54 --> 00:08:49,65
and with the councils even now the lismore
city council which has an effect.

112
00:08:49,88 --> 00:09:01,28
Most of these multiple occupancy it.

113
00:09:01,30 --> 00:09:05,63
I suppose one of the worst examples i can
think of at the present stage have been

114
00:09:05,63 --> 00:09:09,04
quite a few but one of the
worst examples was over it.

115
00:09:10,04 --> 00:09:10,97
To remain here creek

116
00:09:12,05 --> 00:09:16,74
and i think i'm right in our wallets a
road i'm sorry that's the one we had a lot

117
00:09:16,74 --> 00:09:19,19
of problems over there and one

118
00:09:19,20 --> 00:09:22,42
and we even had about three council
inspections with all aldermen

119
00:09:22,42 --> 00:09:26,97
and administration staff and we
just could not get off the ground

120
00:09:26,97 --> 00:09:31,79
but we tried to force the ordinances
on them and the ombudsman

121
00:09:31,79 --> 00:09:33,49
and other ministers of state stepped in

122
00:09:35,32 --> 00:09:40,56
and stopped as doing anything real
thing about that. What i feel that.

123
00:09:41,27 --> 00:09:44,99
It has not been a good thing as far
as state and local government.

124
00:09:45,11 --> 00:09:46,78
Relationships are concerned

125
00:09:46,78 --> 00:09:52,48
when they wouldn't back the local government
up in we were trying to rectify a

126
00:09:52,48 --> 00:09:58,82
problem that was caused by a
multiple occupancy development.

127
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,70
Illegal buildings they not
even a development application

128
00:10:04,55 --> 00:10:10,90
or a building up like a can put into council
they had houses resting on logs on the

129
00:10:10,90 --> 00:10:13,71
ground that they've fallen in the forest.

130
00:10:14,98 --> 00:10:21,57
They had houses built in the forest
which i suppose at least a metre of

131
00:10:22,72 --> 00:10:26,59
material that combustion material
that would burn at the you know.

132
00:10:27,72 --> 00:10:33,08
The least thing to started off and we
just couldn't get into their heads

133
00:10:33,08 --> 00:10:37,68
that they needed protection they had no
protection themselves they expected the

134
00:10:37,68 --> 00:10:43,76
council to provide everything that
some of the really bad cases.

135
00:10:43,78 --> 00:10:49,13
All them have not been that bad.

136
00:10:50,28 --> 00:10:51,58
Bodie farm and the other one.

137
00:10:51,60 --> 00:11:06,44
Of course the other side of it.

138
00:11:07,68 --> 00:11:08,99
That was the argument ian.

139
00:11:09,55 --> 00:11:14,18
And most certainly that lent a lot
of weight to had the concession

140
00:11:14,18 --> 00:11:18,52
that the council that they
got away with council.

141
00:11:18,92 --> 00:11:20,63
But i don't believe

142
00:11:20,63 --> 00:11:24,42
that they should be treated any
other different to any other one.

143
00:11:24,43 --> 00:11:26,67
They've got to abide by the regulations

144
00:11:26,67 --> 00:11:31,09
and most certainly the regulations
regarding multiply communities

145
00:11:31,09 --> 00:11:33,80
or these type of building
most certainly is lower.

146
00:11:33,92 --> 00:11:35,52
So i feel it lowered

147
00:11:35,52 --> 00:11:44,08
and then the other building for any other
development developing in the community.

148
00:11:45,09 --> 00:11:48,47
No they shouldn't be treated any
differently at all like in other words

149
00:11:48,47 --> 00:11:51,90
irrespective of what the building
conditions are if they agree to

150
00:11:51,90 --> 00:11:53,08
that they must do it.

151
00:11:53,23 --> 00:11:58,28
And unfortunately they go ahead
and put a put a building up

152
00:11:58,28 --> 00:11:59,85
that doesn't conform in any.

153
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,52
Shape or form and then we've got
well the council has big problems

154
00:12:05,52 --> 00:12:09,34
and whether they can pull
it down or knock it down

155
00:12:09,34 --> 00:12:12,48
and we've seen to a very
very not in this council

156
00:12:12,48 --> 00:12:17,22
but in the local in the neighbouring
council of cairo go where they've had the

157
00:12:17,22 --> 00:12:22,66
pre-teen and there's been very
very big unrest over in three

158
00:12:22,66 --> 00:12:25,46
or four day programme
of pulling houses apart

159
00:12:25,46 --> 00:12:31,44
and i'd hate to see our
council having to do that.

160
00:12:32,29 --> 00:12:34,71
It is a very drastic measure
but however i believe

161
00:12:34,71 --> 00:12:36,09
that they bring it on themselves

162
00:12:36,09 --> 00:12:40,44
when they don't by abide like they greta
in the first place to get a development

163
00:12:41,22 --> 00:12:43,35
and then when they get the
development they go ahead

164
00:12:43,35 --> 00:12:45,22
and do whatever they want to do and

165
00:12:45,22 --> 00:12:56,83
that is wrong.

166
00:12:56,85 --> 00:12:59,76
Way.

167
00:12:59,78 --> 00:13:03,21
Yes but he and i agree what you
say but however they've been here

168
00:13:03,21 --> 00:13:06,74
and they're they're not causing any
problems. For anyone else either.

169
00:13:08,43 --> 00:13:11,71
And they are some of them are taking
part in the community affairs

170
00:13:11,71 --> 00:13:15,34
and helping to shape the community
they would like to see it done and

171
00:13:15,34 --> 00:13:19,19
that i'd like to see them all doing
instead of the extremists getting out

172
00:13:19,19 --> 00:13:21,74
and laying down in front of bulldozers or.

173
00:13:21,76 --> 00:13:23,01
Chainsaws or something to

174
00:13:23,01 --> 00:13:33,67
that effect.

175
00:13:35,25 --> 00:13:39,96
Yeah some of the buildings that we inspected
left i helluva lot to be desired.

176
00:13:41,91 --> 00:13:47,63
There and i'll pick reason i'll
bales and even cream sheds

177
00:13:47,63 --> 00:13:50,27
and things like it to start at all
four and they were slapped up.

178
00:13:50,73 --> 00:13:52,79
By a bit of blue plastic
and stuff like that.

179
00:13:52,86 --> 00:13:56,83
The only only thing they had from
weatherboard but they'd be the worst ones.

180
00:13:58,03 --> 00:13:59,62
There were the others that.

181
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,70
Almost would conform to
building regulations

182
00:14:02,70 --> 00:14:05,93
but they never ever got
permission to do it and

183
00:14:05,93 --> 00:14:08,89
that was a problem they didn't want to
get permission they just went ahead.

184
00:14:09,21 --> 00:14:15,12
But if they had of went ahead there their
house would have been been able to be.

185
00:14:15,13 --> 00:14:21,51
To be modified without any real great
effort on their part to make it

186
00:14:22,21 --> 00:14:28,93
fit the building codes and
that what they didn't do.

187
00:14:28,95 --> 00:14:34,62
Oh you can hear the local
policeman was called down to the.

188
00:14:35,15 --> 00:14:38,33
Showground to go.

189
00:14:38,35 --> 00:14:40,23
Talk to a fellow or put a follow in

190
00:14:40,23 --> 00:14:43,80
that was causing a disturbance at the
local show or up to the local show

191
00:14:45,14 --> 00:14:48,52
and he would have had to have a bottle
of tequila and a bottle of scotch and

192
00:14:48,52 --> 00:14:51,22
and about a keg of beer to get
in the condition he was in

193
00:14:52,39 --> 00:14:55,59
and he was running around
brandishing a acts in his hand.

194
00:14:56,95 --> 00:15:01,12
So anyway the local policeman you had was
so he got about three more police to come

195
00:15:01,12 --> 00:15:04,24
out to lismore and they went down. And.

196
00:15:05,58 --> 00:15:08,73
The local police and even the only
went up to him and he said come on it.

197
00:15:08,74 --> 00:15:12,95
I've got to take you up to the
police station. If that's alright.

198
00:15:13,09 --> 00:15:17,29
He said it'd take me in and so any mate at
all. I bet i'd try to him a little bit.

199
00:15:17,32 --> 00:15:19,55
So he pulled his baton and
he hit him across the knee

200
00:15:19,55 --> 00:15:24,26
that usually brings them down on their knees
pretty quickly this violent ever even

201
00:15:24,26 --> 00:15:26,21
turned a muscle.

202
00:15:26,45 --> 00:15:30,47
So he put the matter need other
hand hit him across the other night

203
00:15:32,02 --> 00:15:34,37
and they looked at his look
made he said if i were you.

204
00:15:34,40 --> 00:15:36,37
He did i put that away before
i do something with it.

205
00:15:39,74 --> 00:15:41,87
And he did it.

206
00:15:43,23 --> 00:15:48,46
In every field anything.

207
00:15:48,47 --> 00:15:51,78
I know he was a.

208
00:15:51,79 --> 00:15:56,70
Call in and i used to call him
the indian indian something.

209
00:15:56,72 --> 00:15:59,79
He was a big man they reckon he'd take about
three bottles of the keel of the game

210
00:15:59,79 --> 00:16:02,68
in. That's made any run longstreet
with the accent right now let everyone

211
00:16:02,68 --> 00:16:06,95
but never hurt anyone. But the local
people didn't like him at all.

212
00:16:07,15 --> 00:16:09,83
He thought the danger
though the your concern.

213
00:16:11,15 --> 00:16:14,97
So he put the baton back in the thing like
an act impolitely to get in the in the

214
00:16:14,97 --> 00:16:23,42
van which he did.

215
00:16:24,79 --> 00:16:28,78
I suppose one of the great characters
and you'll probably interviewing him.

216
00:16:29,07 --> 00:16:33,13
The fellow called harry
anything. Harry is.

217
00:16:33,91 --> 00:16:39,34
Comes from tunnel ford coordination
co-operative he's been there since 1970 273

218
00:16:39,34 --> 00:16:41,97
harry was always very thin
and we always thought

219
00:16:41,97 --> 00:16:43,66
that harry would never
see the next winter.

220
00:16:44,83 --> 00:16:48,02
Out but harry and we to go in the truck
driver because used to drive there.

221
00:16:48,86 --> 00:16:53,51
The truck that used to go to brisbane
bring back their supplies of vegetables

222
00:16:53,51 --> 00:16:58,12
and stuff. However we all didn't see
the next winter out each year that

223
00:16:58,12 --> 00:17:02,40
when part with all the next winter.
We'll get him. However how anything is.

224
00:17:03,87 --> 00:17:08,40
I think he's president of the progress
association of the president stage he does a

225
00:17:08,40 --> 00:17:12,18
lot for community affairs he does a lot
for people in sport and helps kids

226
00:17:12,18 --> 00:17:15,23
and money mother and to my
knowledge harry did not married

227
00:17:16,23 --> 00:17:19,11
and i can assure you with one
fine gentleman with harry any

228
00:17:19,11 --> 00:17:23,33
but he had one of the old identities
of nimbin that that everyone and him

229
00:17:23,33 --> 00:17:30,61
and liked in appreciates he's a tremendous
fellow he looked up to everyone in him.
