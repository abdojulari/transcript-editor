1
00:00:05,74 --> 00:00:09,69
Ok. I tape i do. It's tuesday
the 2nd of march 1993.

2
00:00:10,08 --> 00:00:11,89
I'm in sydney

3
00:00:11,89 --> 00:00:16,31
and john cedars in lismore we're doing
a two way for under the rainbow.

4
00:00:17,72 --> 00:00:21,05
John can i get is start by
introducing who you are and

5
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:24,09
when you first came to nimbin
air and how you are you see.

6
00:00:24,12 --> 00:00:30,91
So describe how you fit in well. My
name's john seed and presently i'm.

7
00:00:30,92 --> 00:00:35,98
I guess a rainforest conservationist
and eco philosopher.

8
00:00:37,38 --> 00:00:40,28
I arrived in nimbin august 1973.

9
00:00:40,83 --> 00:00:44,61
I'd been living in england for five years

10
00:00:46,08 --> 00:00:52,42
and was on my way back to australia
travelling for about nine months overland

11
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:57,18
through asia meditating in india
and nepal studying meditation

12
00:00:57,18 --> 00:01:01,87
and i never heard of nimbin or the aquarius
festival tomorrow of back in august

13
00:01:02,78 --> 00:01:03,88
and then.

14
00:01:03,90 --> 00:01:08,86
A good friend of mine carol elliott who's
you know a pretty important figure.

15
00:01:08,86 --> 00:01:12,12
I think in the nimbin story carol
elliott and norman stannard

16
00:01:13,21 --> 00:01:18,03
when i got to sydney with my wife greater.

17
00:01:18,82 --> 00:01:20,22
They said oh you've got to go up to nimbin

18
00:01:20,22 --> 00:01:22,83
and we've got a place there you
can stay out on crofton zero.

19
00:01:23,08 --> 00:01:26,47
So we drove straight up. We
didn't like sydney too much.

20
00:01:26,51 --> 00:01:28,97
We drove straight up and well
it's been here ever since.

21
00:01:31,42 --> 00:01:35,98
Can you tell us about those early
days in how you started out.

22
00:01:36,12 --> 00:01:38,70
Well i remember carol
and norman saying well

23
00:01:38,70 --> 00:01:42,91
when you get to nimbin just go to
the rainbow cafe and ask for jimbo.

24
00:01:43,18 --> 00:01:46,80
And i thought i you know i just thought
of an australian cafe and i thought i.

25
00:01:46,81 --> 00:01:50,69
That's an unusual name for a cafe
the rainbow and we got to nimbin

26
00:01:50,69 --> 00:01:53,17
and there was the rainbow
exactly where it is now

27
00:01:53,17 --> 00:01:59,91
and we got there just in time for dinner
which was a communal meal around. One.

28
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,14
Long table

29
00:02:01,14 --> 00:02:07,79
and basically i realized later the
whole of the new settler community in

30
00:02:07,79 --> 00:02:10,79
that region was sitting around
that table that night you know

31
00:02:10,79 --> 00:02:13,46
that everyone had gone
back from the festival

32
00:02:13,46 --> 00:02:15,51
and there was just a
handful of people maybe 20

33
00:02:15,51 --> 00:02:20,79
or 30 people left after the festival and
they were all sitting around that table.

34
00:02:21,09 --> 00:02:23,03
So it's grown a lot since then.

35
00:02:24,27 --> 00:02:26,47
So you did you see yourself as part of

36
00:02:26,47 --> 00:02:33,03
that back to the earth movement were you
there too. You know to get back to.

37
00:02:33,04 --> 00:02:35,25
You know starting your own
plot building your own her.

38
00:02:35,51 --> 00:02:38,97
Well i i quickly came
to see myself that way

39
00:02:38,97 --> 00:02:42,72
that wasn't my original intention in going
up there originally i just moved to the

40
00:02:42,72 --> 00:02:49,26
country and i had you know some interesting
communities i've been part of a.

41
00:02:49,27 --> 00:02:55,75
Kind of abortive attempt at a community
in northern california a couple of years

42
00:02:55,75 --> 00:03:00,23
previously that only lasted a few months
but i had you know had time to by go

43
00:03:00,23 --> 00:03:06,87
and create my first garden which was in
a spiral and. You know but but quickly.

44
00:03:07,91 --> 00:03:11,26
I came to you know be very
much part of that movement

45
00:03:11,26 --> 00:03:17,50
and i was part of the original
group of shareholders in the dream

46
00:03:18,61 --> 00:03:20,70
that of coordination co-operative

47
00:03:20,70 --> 00:03:26,19
that then went on to become the community
attainable falls and both greater

48
00:03:26,19 --> 00:03:30,40
and i bought shares in that before you
know there was any land or anything like

49
00:03:30,40 --> 00:03:33,80
that we just bought
shares in that dream and.

50
00:03:35,48 --> 00:03:40,67
But i myself was looking for a more spiritual
community i said i wanted to you know

51
00:03:40,67 --> 00:03:44,47
i'd been meditating in
india and nepal as i say

52
00:03:44,47 --> 00:03:51,61
and as soon as we arrived in australia
we made contact with an english.

53
00:03:51,63 --> 00:03:56,78
Buddhist monk he was a you know wearing
thai buddhist robes called prior candy

54
00:03:56,78 --> 00:03:59,96
parlow who was teaching
meditation at the chinese.

55
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,68
These buddhist society index and street in
sydney and we invited him up and he did.

56
00:04:06,70 --> 00:04:09,71
The first meditation retreats
i think it was still in 73

57
00:04:09,71 --> 00:04:14,36
or maybe 74 we organized maybe i
over the next couple of years five

58
00:04:14,36 --> 00:04:18,76
or six meditation retreats for him which
i think you know had quite a profound

59
00:04:18,76 --> 00:04:21,13
influence on the direction
of that community.

60
00:04:21,40 --> 00:04:26,86
Most of the people who were up there at
that time were you know took part in one

61
00:04:26,86 --> 00:04:29,79
or more of those retreats and so.

62
00:04:29,81 --> 00:04:35,72
I was looking for a more you know cohesive
integrated like minded community of

63
00:04:35,72 --> 00:04:39,20
people who are committed to
personal and spiritual growth

64
00:04:39,20 --> 00:04:41,51
and co-ordination co-operative

65
00:04:41,51 --> 00:04:44,08
and tangible were always a
little bit to kind of crazy

66
00:04:44,08 --> 00:04:48,06
and wild for my own
tastes at that time and.

67
00:04:49,51 --> 00:04:52,14
So in 1975.

68
00:04:53,33 --> 00:04:56,60
Dhammananda which is a community
into rainier creek road

69
00:04:57,32 --> 00:05:01,07
that had actually started before
the aquarius festival they bought

70
00:05:01,07 --> 00:05:05,32
that land i think in 71 or 72 and.

71
00:05:05,34 --> 00:05:09,01
The land stretch from training a creek
up to wallace road on the ridge

72
00:05:09,01 --> 00:05:13,28
that separates rainier creek
from tangible creek and.

73
00:05:13,30 --> 00:05:18,73
Dhammananda donated a section of their
land on top of that ridge for the dream

74
00:05:18,73 --> 00:05:22,73
that i had had and that i shared
with them of a meditation centre

75
00:05:22,73 --> 00:05:26,21
and so in 1975.

76
00:05:27,66 --> 00:05:32,13
Several of us began to build
up there we built a shed in 75

77
00:05:32,13 --> 00:05:37,15
and started to you know build the
foundations for a meditation centre

78
00:05:37,15 --> 00:05:40,31
and then later in 75.
I went back to india.

79
00:05:40,34 --> 00:05:42,58
Again for more meditation

80
00:05:42,58 --> 00:05:48,32
and to spend some time with a teacher a
woman called vimal issaka who also came

81
00:05:48,33 --> 00:05:51,49
back and forth teaching.

82
00:05:51,50 --> 00:05:56,52
In australia and up in the nimbin area
a few times over the years after that.

83
00:05:56,72 --> 00:06:01,79
And at that time. In dallas.
How she in the himalayas.

84
00:06:01,81 --> 00:06:07,00
While i was there to spend some time
with the miller and norman stannard

85
00:06:07,01 --> 00:06:12,92
and carol elliot who started birth and
beyond in nimbin the home birthing.

86
00:06:14,10 --> 00:06:16,45
You know midwives i guess they.

87
00:06:17,00 --> 00:06:22,45
They and i met in dalhousie to be with
their miller and we also met another.

88
00:06:22,47 --> 00:06:27,10
Thai buddhist monk an englishman
whose name now is christopher titmus

89
00:06:27,10 --> 00:06:28,47
and he's quite a famous.

90
00:06:29,06 --> 00:06:31,87
Progressive meditation teacher
who lives in england now

91
00:06:31,87 --> 00:06:35,44
and he's no longer a monk but.

92
00:06:35,46 --> 00:06:39,86
He was in dalhousie carol and norman
were doing a meditation retreat with him

93
00:06:39,86 --> 00:06:43,10
and a whole bunch of young
western as were there.

94
00:06:43,18 --> 00:06:47,05
So i went looking for carol in norman
walking up the side of this beautiful

95
00:06:47,05 --> 00:06:49,70
mountain and i came around
a turn of the mountain

96
00:06:49,70 --> 00:06:51,50
and there was this little child shop.

97
00:06:51,64 --> 00:06:57,18
You know like a little tea shop called a
tired man's delight overlooking the you

98
00:06:57,18 --> 00:07:00,33
know plain of the ganges
many thousands of feet below

99
00:07:01,05 --> 00:07:04,35
and there's a whole bunch of young western
as there are americans new zealanders

100
00:07:04,35 --> 00:07:06,64
australians sitting around drinking coffee

101
00:07:06,64 --> 00:07:09,47
and eating sweet cakes from
this meditation retreat.

102
00:07:10,12 --> 00:07:14,41
And i sat down with them and
within five minutes we had agreed

103
00:07:14,41 --> 00:07:17,54
that they you know a whole bunch of them
were coming over to help build this

104
00:07:17,54 --> 00:07:19,12
meditation centre and

105
00:07:19,12 --> 00:07:22,55
that we were going to then look
for a piece of land nearby to buy

106
00:07:22,55 --> 00:07:25,75
and to grow our food and
build our houses and

107
00:07:26,79 --> 00:07:30,41
that we'd be caretakers of
the meditation centre and

108
00:07:30,41 --> 00:07:32,33
that was what actually happened.

109
00:07:32,35 --> 00:07:35,14
So within about 10 minutes
of that meeting the next.

110
00:07:35,15 --> 00:07:41,81
I guess at least the next five years of my
life were pretty well laid out on a map

111
00:07:41,81 --> 00:07:45,30
and what we discussed there
was exactly what happened.

112
00:07:45,65 --> 00:07:49,10
Christopher came to australia
a few months later.

113
00:07:49,12 --> 00:07:54,40
Maybe about maybe nearly a year later to
lead the first meditation retreat at this

114
00:07:54,40 --> 00:07:59,15
meditation centre that we had
built in the meantime and the.

115
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,16
Participants in there was
actually three retreats

116
00:08:03,16 --> 00:08:07,87
and maybe about 50 participants in each
so out of those hundred fifty people we

117
00:08:07,87 --> 00:08:12,57
found 20 who wanted to share that
dream of a spiritual community

118
00:08:12,57 --> 00:08:18,11
and we each put in a thousand
bucks and bought body farm.

119
00:08:18,13 --> 00:08:21,51
So that was in 75 76

120
00:08:21,51 --> 00:08:27,70
and basically up until the two
rainier creek action in 79.

121
00:08:27,97 --> 00:08:31,11
That was my life. There are
my son was born there.

122
00:08:31,19 --> 00:08:36,81
His name is bodie he's 15 now and
he he was the first child born on

123
00:08:36,81 --> 00:08:43,24
that farm so it was named after it
and we build our own houses and.

124
00:08:43,26 --> 00:08:47,81
You know raised our kids and grew
organic fruit and veggies and stuff

125
00:08:47,81 --> 00:08:50,75
and lived a very pure and
beautiful life there.

126
00:08:51,11 --> 00:08:57,61
Tells about some of the the rules. Of
body farm some of the the ethics etc..

127
00:08:58,01 --> 00:09:04,88
Well it was a very very highly ethical
society we lived by the buddhist precepts of

128
00:09:05,60 --> 00:09:10,92
no killing stealing lying drugs or alcohol

129
00:09:11,93 --> 00:09:13,02
and no sexual misconduct.

130
00:09:13,63 --> 00:09:18,15
I meaning you know you know
sexual conduct that hurt anyone

131
00:09:18,16 --> 00:09:24,13
and we didn't keep any animals
either domestic animals

132
00:09:24,13 --> 00:09:26,05
or you know livestock.

133
00:09:26,37 --> 00:09:30,73
We just want didn't want to have any fences
we just wanted to live with the animals

134
00:09:30,73 --> 00:09:34,75
from the bush and we didn't want any
dogs or cats getting into the bush

135
00:09:34,75 --> 00:09:41,04
and we had a forest management
policy which left 95 percent of the

136
00:09:41,04 --> 00:09:45,94
hundred sixty acres that we bought
was left as bush and the only areas

137
00:09:45,94 --> 00:09:51,07
that we cleared where areas that had
previously been cleared. You know so about.

138
00:09:51,56 --> 00:09:57,29
You know maybe about a 10 per cent of the
land about 16 acres i'd say maximum we

139
00:09:58,08 --> 00:10:01,54
maintained for our buildings
and our agric. I'll check.

140
00:10:01,56 --> 00:10:03,27
We looked after each other

141
00:10:03,27 --> 00:10:07,97
and shared most of our things in common
we shared all of our motor vehicles

142
00:10:07,97 --> 00:10:12,04
that in those early days for instance and.

143
00:10:12,05 --> 00:10:15,74
We had a communal meal every
day we cooked for each other

144
00:10:15,74 --> 00:10:18,47
and you know i just
looked after each other.

145
00:10:18,52 --> 00:10:23,29
There was no doors necessary on the buildings
no one you know it was totally safe

146
00:10:23,29 --> 00:10:24,19
place to have kids

147
00:10:24,19 --> 00:10:30,82
and we're also you know very interested in
social action if this was out our style

148
00:10:30,82 --> 00:10:35,14
of buddhism was what you
might call engaged buddhism

149
00:10:35,14 --> 00:10:37,95
and we were involved in the
social issues of those days.

150
00:10:38,11 --> 00:10:42,14
Specially the home birth
movement which was illegal

151
00:10:42,15 --> 00:10:45,90
and we you know participated in
those illegal home births we felt

152
00:10:45,90 --> 00:10:49,01
that it was everybody's right
to take birth and death

153
00:10:49,01 --> 00:10:53,70
and these things back back from
authorities and back into our own hands

154
00:10:53,70 --> 00:10:59,79
and it's kind of a bit unreal now looking
back on it you know like everything's

155
00:10:59,79 --> 00:11:01,76
changed so much since those days

156
00:11:01,76 --> 00:11:07,08
but it was a very beautiful time we built
16 illegal to a lings on this place.

157
00:11:07,12 --> 00:11:09,57
There was no.

158
00:11:09,58 --> 00:11:16,03
Multiple occupancy wasn't allowed then
in fact it was partly the court cases.

159
00:11:16,04 --> 00:11:20,10
The 16 demolition orders that
were put onto our buildings

160
00:11:20,10 --> 00:11:24,08
that were part of the you
know part of the trigger.

161
00:11:24,12 --> 00:11:27,94
You know or the part of the whole thing

162
00:11:27,94 --> 00:11:33,31
that created multiple occupancy in new
south wales. Looking back on those times.

163
00:11:33,44 --> 00:11:40,04
Now do you do you think in some ways
you are too hard on yourself. So.

164
00:11:40,06 --> 00:11:41,39
Oh no not at all.

165
00:11:41,54 --> 00:11:45,73
I mean if we were to try and do
that from a sense of sacrifice

166
00:11:45,73 --> 00:11:48,20
or a you know i just a sense
of duty or anything like

167
00:11:48,20 --> 00:11:49,56
that it would have been terribly difficult

168
00:11:49,56 --> 00:11:54,38
but it was totally passionate desire you
know we were following our bliss our

169
00:11:54,38 --> 00:12:00,56
ecstasy and i can't think that any of
us have ever been happy. Since then.

170
00:12:00,69 --> 00:12:04,55
Do you know but things change and
times change. We were on a wave.

171
00:12:04,71 --> 00:12:06,58
You know and when you're on a wave.

172
00:12:06,68 --> 00:12:09,38
It's easier just catch the
wave and you stay on it

173
00:12:09,38 --> 00:12:12,91
but if you have to swim in the same direction
it's a different matter. You know.

174
00:12:12,96 --> 00:12:15,32
So we were on a wave and it was great.

175
00:12:16,19 --> 00:12:22,62
There's no sense of failure in the fact
that a lot of those the level of sharing

176
00:12:22,62 --> 00:12:25,97
and stuff that was happening
then isn't still happening now.

177
00:12:25,99 --> 00:12:28,42
But if i'm well i mean.

178
00:12:28,44 --> 00:12:32,83
It's easy to get into that you know like
idealizing the past or something like

179
00:12:32,83 --> 00:12:33,11
that

180
00:12:33,11 --> 00:12:37,82
but it's i don't think it's a sense of
failure it's a body farm is an incredibly

181
00:12:37,82 --> 00:12:40,24
beautiful place now and in
fact i'm living there again.

182
00:12:40,30 --> 00:12:44,04
I've been away for quite some years
but i've moved back there again

183
00:12:44,04 --> 00:12:45,64
and i think it's fantastic.

184
00:12:46,20 --> 00:12:50,24
And the fact that there's only one communal
meal or two a week now and the fact

185
00:12:50,24 --> 00:12:54,23
that people don't share their cars anymore
because it was just such a hassle

186
00:12:54,23 --> 00:12:58,00
maintaining you know a shared vehicles

187
00:12:58,01 --> 00:13:01,87
and you know you know
other things that you

188
00:13:01,87 --> 00:13:05,44
and other thing at the beginning was
that no one owned their buildings

189
00:13:05,44 --> 00:13:08,12
that anyone who built a
building on the land.

190
00:13:08,22 --> 00:13:11,00
It belonged to the land so
that you know if you left.

191
00:13:11,21 --> 00:13:15,77
You just it was left there for someone
else do you know and so there's no buying

192
00:13:15,77 --> 00:13:18,62
or selling of buildings. That's
kind of changed a little bit.

193
00:13:18,64 --> 00:13:22,54
I mean you know not not totally

194
00:13:22,54 --> 00:13:25,60
but you know things you know
things change people get older

195
00:13:25,60 --> 00:13:28,10
and i think it's still great.

196
00:13:30,14 --> 00:13:34,60
What about the strain on
relationships at a place like boat.

197
00:13:34,78 --> 00:13:35,97
But if i'm in those as we go.

198
00:13:36,90 --> 00:13:42,74
Well i don't think i can't remember
anything anything particular.

199
00:13:42,75 --> 00:13:44,14
You know i mean i don't think

200
00:13:44,14 --> 00:13:46,34
that there was such a strain
on relationships i think

201
00:13:46,34 --> 00:13:50,44
that there's a huge strain on relationships
in the nuclear family situation where

202
00:13:50,44 --> 00:13:55,29
the only people that you have that you
close to you know are you know like three

203
00:13:55,29 --> 00:13:55,83
or four people

204
00:13:55,83 --> 00:13:59,91
and then with them they're on top of you
all the time place like body farm all.

205
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,39
The kids had you know a dozen you know
people that they loved and that they held

206
00:14:05,39 --> 00:14:09,96
and were close to and so if
your parents were off the air.

207
00:14:10,03 --> 00:14:11,16
It just didn't matter so much.

208
00:14:11,46 --> 00:14:17,76
You know and also there was you know
levels of sharing and communion

209
00:14:17,76 --> 00:14:21,62
and intimacy that i think you know
that that's how we're meant to live.

210
00:14:21,80 --> 00:14:23,01
Really you know that's how we.

211
00:14:23,04 --> 00:14:26,33
That's that's how our tribes were
for hundreds of thousands of years

212
00:14:26,33 --> 00:14:32,03
and i think it's a terrible strain
to try and live any other way.

213
00:14:32,04 --> 00:14:36,15
Can you tell us about the development of
the green lobby of the throne for its

214
00:14:36,15 --> 00:14:38,13
information center and
where you fit into that.

215
00:14:38,21 --> 00:14:44,22
Well that goes back to august 79
when you know rainier creek blew up

216
00:14:44,22 --> 00:14:49,80
and this was i made a modest start again.
And so you know to make it a statement.

217
00:14:49,98 --> 00:14:56,96
Back in our lot of well back in 1979 in
august i went to the channon market which

218
00:14:56,96 --> 00:15:02,73
is a monthly craft and produce market
down the chain and just near body farm

219
00:15:02,73 --> 00:15:04,35
and.

220
00:15:04,36 --> 00:15:09,63
Some of our neighbors from down in the
valley at rainier creek appealed for help.

221
00:15:10,07 --> 00:15:13,22
They'd been struggling
for five years to try

222
00:15:13,22 --> 00:15:16,35
and stop the forestry commission
from logging the end of

223
00:15:16,35 --> 00:15:18,74
that valley rainforest down there

224
00:15:18,74 --> 00:15:22,72
and they the forestry commission were
coming in the following day with bulldozers

225
00:15:22,72 --> 00:15:29,03
and they wanted neighbours to help to do a
blockade and that seemed very. You know.

226
00:15:29,62 --> 00:15:30,90
Far away for me.

227
00:15:30,92 --> 00:15:33,38
From what i was interested in i
was interested in meditation

228
00:15:33,38 --> 00:15:35,35
and organic gardening and stuff

229
00:15:35,35 --> 00:15:39,72
but somehow the next day along with i think
just about everyone from body farm i

230
00:15:39,72 --> 00:15:43,89
found myself down there with a few
hundred people and we did this blockade

231
00:15:43,89 --> 00:15:47,01
and it was incredible and somehow

232
00:15:47,01 --> 00:15:51,11
or rather a lot of people were very very
moved their lives were moved by that

233
00:15:51,11 --> 00:15:53,06
but my life was totally transformed

234
00:15:53,06 --> 00:15:59,92
and in fact within two years it had pulled
me off body farm entirely but it's.

235
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,42
Started more slowly than that and i was
sort of back and forth but you know

236
00:16:04,42 --> 00:16:07,30
when i was in the rainforest i
heard it screaming you know

237
00:16:07,30 --> 00:16:08,91
and i heard it screaming for help

238
00:16:09,63 --> 00:16:13,93
and over the next couple
of years at training creek

239
00:16:13,93 --> 00:16:16,29
and later on in the campaign
for the nightcap range

240
00:16:16,29 --> 00:16:20,70
and the rainforest of new south wales
i became more and more my life

241
00:16:20,70 --> 00:16:26,47
and the life of the rainforest
became enmeshed so in 1981

242
00:16:27,51 --> 00:16:31,52
having learnt about the plight of the
rainforests in many other countries

243
00:16:31,52 --> 00:16:38,05
and empowered by our success in really
being able to do something you know moving

244
00:16:38,06 --> 00:16:43,69
from a situation in august 79 where most
people had never even heard of rainforests

245
00:16:43,69 --> 00:16:47,55
let alone knew their
significance to eighty two.

246
00:16:47,57 --> 00:16:52,63
When the rand government made their stark
decision to protect the rainforest of new

247
00:16:52,63 --> 00:16:55,35
south wales. We felt incredibly empowered

248
00:16:55,35 --> 00:16:59,03
that ordinary people who didn't
have any particular training

249
00:16:59,03 --> 00:17:01,89
or background could really do
something and we'd also learnt

250
00:17:01,89 --> 00:17:05,32
that the rainforest of the
world were threatened that.

251
00:17:05,33 --> 00:17:10,08
They contained more than 50 per cent
of the world's species of plants

252
00:17:10,08 --> 00:17:10,26
and animals

253
00:17:11,15 --> 00:17:15,14
and at the current rates of destruction
they would be utterly annihilated within

254
00:17:15,14 --> 00:17:16,26
our own lifetime and

255
00:17:16,26 --> 00:17:21,10
that this would be unprecedented in the
history of the world that and also

256
00:17:21,10 --> 00:17:23,82
that many scientists warned that
if we allowed this to happen.

257
00:17:24,09 --> 00:17:26,83
The life support systems of
the earth would be destroyed

258
00:17:26,83 --> 00:17:33,57
and complex life would vanish from the
earth within a few human generations so.

259
00:17:33,59 --> 00:17:37,13
We also discovered in writing
to groups around the world

260
00:17:37,13 --> 00:17:39,18
that there wasn't a
single group at that time

261
00:17:39,18 --> 00:17:41,97
that had the world's
rainforests on its agenda.

262
00:17:42,34 --> 00:17:45,96
So that's when we started the rainforest
information centre in this more

263
00:17:45,96 --> 00:17:48,04
and began networking

264
00:17:48,04 --> 00:17:54,43
and trying to create a network around the
world to work on forest problems in you

265
00:17:54,44 --> 00:17:56,89
know indonesia and brazil
in malaysia in new guinea

266
00:17:56,89 --> 00:17:59,91
and other countries where
the kind of conch.

267
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,18
Yes an os that we developed
didn't exist as yet.

268
00:18:03,26 --> 00:18:06,81
And meanwhile we were still
very very active in.

269
00:18:06,83 --> 00:18:12,65
Issues in australia rainforest
issues from the franklin where about

270
00:18:13,74 --> 00:18:13,92
10

271
00:18:13,92 --> 00:18:18,83
or 15 of us from the lismore area were invited
down by the wilderness society to help

272
00:18:18,83 --> 00:18:21,99
set up their blockade of
the franklin river in 83

273
00:18:21,99 --> 00:18:26,95
and then also up to the daintree where
most of the people at the daintree protest

274
00:18:26,95 --> 00:18:33,76
also came from the you know the from the
nimbin it's rainy creek lismore area and.

275
00:18:33,78 --> 00:18:39,97
Not only rainforest issues in 180 we did
blockades at middle head in the mid-north

276
00:18:39,98 --> 00:18:43,17
coast of new south wales to stop
a sand mining operation there

277
00:18:43,17 --> 00:18:48,39
and also we were very
involved in pine gap and.

278
00:18:48,41 --> 00:18:53,30
A lot of the women were involved in the
women's actions in those days the warship

279
00:18:53,30 --> 00:18:56,25
actions trying to stop the nuclear powered

280
00:18:56,25 --> 00:19:00,77
and american warships from entering
australian waters and so on.

281
00:19:02,07 --> 00:19:08,62
I guess there's traditionally been a lot
of resentment i guess because of because

282
00:19:08,62 --> 00:19:09,07
of the fact

283
00:19:09,07 --> 00:19:13,28
that there's been a lot of people at the
forefront of those movements from the an

284
00:19:13,28 --> 00:19:15,80
end and by a north coast area.

285
00:19:16,54 --> 00:19:17,86
Do you have any apologies for that

286
00:19:17,86 --> 00:19:22,97
or oh no i mean i just think people
are so ungrateful. You know.

287
00:19:22,99 --> 00:19:26,08
I mean you look at the
opinion polls and it's shows

288
00:19:26,08 --> 00:19:30,15
that 90 per cent of everyone thinks that
we need environmental thing and so on

289
00:19:30,15 --> 00:19:30,61
and so on

290
00:19:30,61 --> 00:19:35,36
and no one really acknowledges where
the where the you know where the lead.

291
00:19:35,44 --> 00:19:38,93
You know from that came from and
i know that it's unpopular and

292
00:19:38,93 --> 00:19:42,62
that makes me you know i have all the more
admiration for the people that did it.

293
00:19:42,68 --> 00:19:46,22
Here was this totally thankless
task where people are abused

294
00:19:46,22 --> 00:19:48,59
and vilified for waking everybody up.

295
00:19:48,90 --> 00:19:52,60
You know it's like people want to stay
asleep people would rather choke to death on

296
00:19:52,60 --> 00:19:55,03
their own vomit in their sleep
then wake up i don't know.

297
00:19:55,16 --> 00:19:58,49
So i don't feel apologetic
at all as you can hear.

298
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,96
Ok what about the role
of green extremists.

299
00:20:03,38 --> 00:20:07,60
And what about the term romo worries
do you do this. Socio with that.

300
00:20:07,64 --> 00:20:12,63
Oh well i mean i don't you know i'm not
sort of quite romantic like that myself.

301
00:20:13,12 --> 00:20:16,88
You know i make no good but i can
i get you to start again and make

302
00:20:16,88 --> 00:20:22,28
that a statement. Well i
mean i don't i don't.

303
00:20:22,30 --> 00:20:27,28
I don't associate myself don't think
of myself as a as a rainbow warrior

304
00:20:27,28 --> 00:20:30,77
or anything romantic like that
but i am a green extremist

305
00:20:30,77 --> 00:20:36,13
and i guess i am a rainbow warrior i
mean if that meaning has you know if

306
00:20:36,13 --> 00:20:40,86
that word has any meaning and i think
that i'm surrounded by green extremists

307
00:20:40,86 --> 00:20:41,82
and rainbow warriors here.

308
00:20:42,28 --> 00:20:48,10
The local forest protection society haha
so-called you know the loggers wives

309
00:20:48,10 --> 00:20:52,49
and the rest. They started
a group called rage

310
00:20:52,49 --> 00:20:56,78
and it's something like stands for something
like rage against green extremists

311
00:20:56,78 --> 00:20:57,45
or something like that.

312
00:20:57,52 --> 00:21:02,32
So their own first information center
printed these t-shirts with green extremist

313
00:21:02,32 --> 00:21:03,86
across the front and huge letters

314
00:21:03,86 --> 00:21:06,87
and it's our most popular item
you see everywhere around here

315
00:21:06,87 --> 00:21:12,03
that we sell hundreds of. You know
people are proud to be green extremists.

316
00:21:12,05 --> 00:21:15,59
Can you tell us a bit about
your spiritual journey

317
00:21:15,59 --> 00:21:21,67
and you're developing your
relationship with the rainforest and.

318
00:21:21,68 --> 00:21:23,12
And that that side of it.

319
00:21:23,91 --> 00:21:27,74
Well you know this developed slowly
from those years but i don't know yet

320
00:21:27,74 --> 00:21:34,63
but i can feel so much my spiritual journey
changed from a buddhist perspective to

321
00:21:35,39 --> 00:21:38,92
what i would call deep
ecology over those years.

322
00:21:40,26 --> 00:21:43,31
In the buddhist perspective
really mind and spirit

323
00:21:43,31 --> 00:21:47,21
and the inner life of
human beings is primary

324
00:21:47,21 --> 00:21:52,05
but it quickly became clear to me
in the rainforest that my body

325
00:21:52,05 --> 00:21:56,40
and my mind how devolved within these
very forest over the last hundred fifty

326
00:21:56,40 --> 00:21:59,90
million years ago when. The first flight.

327
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,77
Our implants in the world were
evolving in gone to ana land the giant

328
00:22:04,77 --> 00:22:08,09
supercontinent included
south america and australia

329
00:22:08,09 --> 00:22:11,72
and antarctica covered
in rainforest the place

330
00:22:11,72 --> 00:22:16,34
that is now cape tribulation the first
flowering plants the angio sperms were

331
00:22:16,34 --> 00:22:21,31
developing my answers to some kind of
little rodent scurrying around you know

332
00:22:21,31 --> 00:22:25,04
trying to get out from under the dinosaurs
a hundred thirty million years ago now

333
00:22:25,04 --> 00:22:31,78
since that time my body and my mind
have evolved to where i am now and.

334
00:22:31,80 --> 00:22:36,45
To try and separate the spiritual
life from that incredible miracle of

335
00:22:36,45 --> 00:22:41,30
that evolution it seems to me is a very
futile task and also a dangerous one.

336
00:22:41,40 --> 00:22:47,12
Because as a result of the
way that we despise nature

337
00:22:47,12 --> 00:22:50,54
and think of the earth as
just dirt and having no soul.

338
00:22:50,62 --> 00:22:55,17
Having no intelligence and no life
and by denying our connection with

339
00:22:55,17 --> 00:22:58,97
that i mean if we understand our
own evil lucian then we realize

340
00:22:58,97 --> 00:23:02,35
that we are just like a leaf
on the tree of life and

341
00:23:02,36 --> 00:23:05,39
that if we're alive then it's
only because the tree is alive

342
00:23:05,39 --> 00:23:10,00
and if we're intelligent it's only part
of a tiny fragment of the intelligence of

343
00:23:10,00 --> 00:23:11,21
the tree.

344
00:23:11,22 --> 00:23:16,43
So here's the earth which holds
maybe 10 million species of plants

345
00:23:16,43 --> 00:23:20,47
and animals in incredible symbiosis
and cooperation and partnership

346
00:23:20,47 --> 00:23:25,60
and we are one of those how can we
call that you know how can we think of

347
00:23:25,60 --> 00:23:30,11
that as being dead how can we think of
that as having no soul so very much.

348
00:23:30,37 --> 00:23:36,79
My spiritual journey became one of surrendering
to the body of which i am just one

349
00:23:36,79 --> 00:23:41,72
cell the body of gaia the
living earth and finding

350
00:23:41,72 --> 00:23:45,86
that it's very easy to read receive
instruction and meaning for my life from

351
00:23:45,86 --> 00:23:52,46
that that in the same way as you know my
heart beats and you know my lungs work

352
00:23:52,46 --> 00:23:54,00
and my fingernails grow you know

353
00:23:54,00 --> 00:23:58,13
and they all grow they cooperate
in order to create the integration

354
00:23:58,13 --> 00:24:00,72
that is this body. So i feel. We humans.

355
00:24:00,74 --> 00:24:07,52
If we will let go of our futile kind
of self-interest with the small

356
00:24:07,52 --> 00:24:08,69
ass and recognize

357
00:24:08,69 --> 00:24:14,56
that our own self-interest can't be other
than the interests of the earth of which

358
00:24:14,56 --> 00:24:19,32
we are just a tiny fragment do you
know then you know once we understand

359
00:24:19,32 --> 00:24:23,64
that then it's very easy for our lives
to fall back into harmony again with the

360
00:24:23,64 --> 00:24:27,77
earth in the way that of course our
ancestors lives must have been in harmony

361
00:24:27,77 --> 00:24:31,28
or they wouldn't have survived for a
minute you look around at every tree

362
00:24:31,28 --> 00:24:34,35
and every plant every animal and it
lives in harmony with the earth.

363
00:24:34,35 --> 00:24:35,98
It doesn't struggle against the earth

364
00:24:35,98 --> 00:24:38,75
and it is receives its
instructions for the earth.

365
00:24:38,75 --> 00:24:42,30
It knows how to feed itself how
to breeze how to reproduce itself

366
00:24:43,06 --> 00:24:48,89
but we in our arrogance thinking ourselves
superior to nature have kind of shut

367
00:24:48,90 --> 00:24:51,76
ourselves off from that but
the good news is that all

368
00:24:51,76 --> 00:24:54,62
that we have to do is let go of
that arrogance and recognize

369
00:24:54,62 --> 00:24:59,61
that we are merely part of the earth
merely miraculously part of the earth

370
00:24:59,61 --> 00:25:03,31
and then we too can fall back
into harmony with the earth again

371
00:25:03,31 --> 00:25:08,84
and it's only by doing this i believe
that our race that our species

372
00:25:09,61 --> 00:25:12,25
and indeed complex life at all
will be supported on the earth.

373
00:25:13,40 --> 00:25:17,51
We are the last generation of human
beings that will be in a position to make

374
00:25:17,51 --> 00:25:21,87
that decision. It's clear
from david suzuki says

375
00:25:21,87 --> 00:25:25,99
that we have less than 10 years before
the damage to the life support systems

376
00:25:25,99 --> 00:25:29,61
reaches the point of no
return the damage to the air

377
00:25:29,61 --> 00:25:33,48
and the water in the soil the poisoning of
the earth these these things will reach

378
00:25:33,48 --> 00:25:38,79
a point of no return very very soon and
that unless we take responsibility for.

379
00:25:40,19 --> 00:25:44,99
You know caring for the earth correctly
living correctly on the earth our children

380
00:25:44,99 --> 00:25:45,58
won't get a chance

381
00:25:45,58 --> 00:25:48,87
and no future generation of humans will
have a chance because it will be too late

382
00:25:49,62 --> 00:25:52,85
but that can't come from
a sense of sacrifice

383
00:25:52,85 --> 00:25:56,63
or a sense of duty as long as we
feel separate from nature and think

384
00:25:56,63 --> 00:26:00,74
that you know that we have
to somehow. Protect this.

385
00:26:01,30 --> 00:26:06,53
I think the environment you know something
over there is separate from us then

386
00:26:06,54 --> 00:26:07,56
we're doomed to failure.

387
00:26:07,75 --> 00:26:10,88
It's only when we realize
that we are the environment

388
00:26:10,88 --> 00:26:15,11
that every breath we take nexus to the
earth every drop of water or food

389
00:26:15,96 --> 00:26:18,78
that passes into our body connects
us to the earth we are connected.

390
00:26:19,23 --> 00:26:21,10
It's just that we ignore that connection

391
00:26:21,10 --> 00:26:25,26
and we define ourselves as
purely spiritual beings whatever

392
00:26:25,26 --> 00:26:30,35
that might mean you know once we once we
realize that we are part of the earth

393
00:26:30,35 --> 00:26:33,03
and the spiritual thing is
actually very down to earth.

394
00:26:33,27 --> 00:26:37,33
Anyone who wants to prove this to themselves
only has to hold their breath for

395
00:26:37,33 --> 00:26:37,83
three minutes.

396
00:26:38,08 --> 00:26:41,97
You know anyone holding their breath for
three minutes will quickly realize what

397
00:26:41,97 --> 00:26:47,13
i'm talking about we can call it the
atmosphere and think that it's over there

398
00:26:47,13 --> 00:26:50,87
and that it's not really in our self-interest
to protect it. You know stop the sea.

399
00:26:50,89 --> 00:26:51,93
If seas and so on.

400
00:26:52,08 --> 00:26:55,09
You know but it's not the atmosphere
it's part of our own body

401
00:26:55,09 --> 00:26:59,24
that we're talking about and
by projecting it out there.

402
00:26:59,31 --> 00:27:03,13
We're destroying ourselves and we're
destroying the earth once we acknowledge

403
00:27:03,13 --> 00:27:07,72
that it's part of us. Then there's no
sacrifice necessary in order to protect it.

404
00:27:07,82 --> 00:27:12,14
You know someone's soaring our leg off we
don't sort of say look i'm too busy to

405
00:27:12,14 --> 00:27:14,08
protect it. We know it's part of us

406
00:27:14,08 --> 00:27:19,61
and you know we just do whatever we have
to do so anyway that's my spiritual

407
00:27:19,61 --> 00:27:21,35
position i guess.

408
00:27:21,36 --> 00:27:25,05
I guess the detractors of the the
aquarian ideals who would say

409
00:27:25,05 --> 00:27:28,04
that people who moved to the nimbin area.

410
00:27:28,94 --> 00:27:31,38
20 years ago were saying
the same things then

411
00:27:31,38 --> 00:27:34,83
that we only had you know
less than ten years left.

412
00:27:34,92 --> 00:27:38,07
But look we know we're still
here and it hasn't happened.

413
00:27:38,36 --> 00:27:41,70
Doomsday stuff hasn't happened. Well. So.

414
00:27:42,07 --> 00:27:45,62
I think it has happened but.

415
00:27:45,64 --> 00:27:48,67
I mean you know look around you look
at what's happening to the world.

416
00:27:48,68 --> 00:27:50,87
It's you know it's just a tragedy.

417
00:27:51,07 --> 00:27:54,94
You know but you know the poisoning
of the air and the oceans

418
00:27:54,94 --> 00:27:59,83
and the quality of life deteriorating
and so on but anyway i'm.

419
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:00,89
Personally not saying

420
00:28:00,89 --> 00:28:04,94
that it is going to happen in 10 years
myself i'm quoting david suzuki who says

421
00:28:04,94 --> 00:28:10,16
that i myself feel that the earth has
more resilience than that but the fact

422
00:28:10,16 --> 00:28:12,76
that this is coming very very soon.

423
00:28:13,05 --> 00:28:16,83
I don't think that there's any
doubt about that we're losing.

424
00:28:16,84 --> 00:28:21,44
An average of more than 200 species
every day. This can't go on.

425
00:28:21,51 --> 00:28:25,07
There's a finite you know there's
there's there's only so much

426
00:28:25,07 --> 00:28:28,35
that the earth can take i think
everybody knows this. Anyway.

427
00:28:28,48 --> 00:28:30,96
You know this high i don't
think many people would say

428
00:28:30,96 --> 00:28:34,62
that anymore i think most people would
if they really honest with themselves

429
00:28:34,62 --> 00:28:36,35
realized that this can't go on.

430
00:28:37,70 --> 00:28:39,97
Can you tell it's a bit about
the way that you explored

431
00:28:40,90 --> 00:28:46,33
that by spirituality i'm thinking of the
council of all beings which was something

432
00:28:46,33 --> 00:28:50,24
that you instigated and you co-wrote
a book called thinking like amount.

433
00:28:50,29 --> 00:28:53,90
Can you expand on some of themes
that though. Well you know.

434
00:28:53,92 --> 00:28:59,63
This deep ecology philosophy which i've
kind of been expanding you know was very

435
00:28:59,63 --> 00:29:02,01
satisfying but i realized that
it didn't change anything

436
00:29:02,01 --> 00:29:03,87
that we could have these ideas

437
00:29:03,87 --> 00:29:08,10
but it was still terribly difficult to
change our behavior and as i looked into

438
00:29:08,10 --> 00:29:08,35
that.

439
00:29:10,28 --> 00:29:18,31
I say ok

440
00:29:18,32 --> 00:29:24,83
so the council of all beings was an
attempt to bring deep ecology to life to

441
00:29:24,83 --> 00:29:27,57
actually change our behavior and.

442
00:29:27,59 --> 00:29:28,71
One of the things

443
00:29:28,71 --> 00:29:32,86
that i realized as i was studying
this problem is of how is it

444
00:29:32,86 --> 00:29:37,40
that we human beings can be so
stupid as to saw off the very branch

445
00:29:37,40 --> 00:29:41,08
that we ourselves are sitting on i mean we
why do we do we want to commit suicide.

446
00:29:41,67 --> 00:29:45,85
What are we doing. How come it's so
difficult to change and i realize

447
00:29:45,85 --> 00:29:52,78
that we modern humans are the first
civilization in the history of the world to

448
00:29:52,78 --> 00:29:57,58
dispense with the rituals and
ceremonies that all other people's have

449
00:29:57,58 --> 00:29:59,91
and still do practice quit.

450
00:30:01,24 --> 00:30:05,18
Acknowledge and nurture that
interconnectedness between human beings

451
00:30:05,18 --> 00:30:08,34
and the rest of the earth
community that it seems as though

452
00:30:08,34 --> 00:30:14,32
that sense of interconnectedness which all
other species have you know i mean baboo

453
00:30:14,32 --> 00:30:17,63
nz and flowers never forget
that they're part of the earth.

454
00:30:17,88 --> 00:30:19,28
You know never occurs to them.

455
00:30:19,48 --> 00:30:22,01
So we humans of the first ones to think

456
00:30:22,01 --> 00:30:25,51
that we might be something special
something superior something different

457
00:30:25,51 --> 00:30:30,56
and the way that we've you know
remained connected to the earth

458
00:30:30,56 --> 00:30:35,72
and remained part of the great symphony
and not just got lost in our own ideas

459
00:30:35,72 --> 00:30:38,74
and thoughts was with these
ceremonies in these rituals

460
00:30:38,74 --> 00:30:43,44
and so the council of all beings
is a modern version of this.

461
00:30:43,50 --> 00:30:49,00
It's a way in which through a couple
of days of ceremony and ritual

462
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:49,32
and

463
00:30:50,32 --> 00:30:56,99
and communion with each other we can
reestablish not the idea of deep ecology

464
00:30:56,99 --> 00:31:00,56
but the living experience of deep
ecology the living experience

465
00:31:00,56 --> 00:31:04,48
that the earth is my body and once i feel

466
00:31:04,48 --> 00:31:08,40
that the earth is my body it becomes much
much simpler to defend the earth because

467
00:31:08,40 --> 00:31:11,34
it's i'm no longer defending
something outside myself

468
00:31:11,34 --> 00:31:14,01
and so it's like it wasn't the right.

469
00:31:14,21 --> 00:31:19,25
It wasn't me as a separate being defending
the rainforest the environment.

470
00:31:19,28 --> 00:31:22,37
I became that part of the rainforest.

471
00:31:22,38 --> 00:31:24,31
That was acting in its own self-defense

472
00:31:25,16 --> 00:31:27,36
and of course self defense
is much much easier.

473
00:31:27,68 --> 00:31:30,84
It doesn't require any great nobility

474
00:31:30,85 --> 00:31:35,45
or any great you know special qualities
anybody can defend themselves.

475
00:31:36,84 --> 00:31:40,13
Can you tell us a bit about what happens
you know during those three days in the

476
00:31:40,13 --> 00:31:43,49
car if we will all beings what are people
actually do to get to come around to

477
00:31:43,49 --> 00:31:46,82
that. Well i did it first
of all i'd have to say

478
00:31:46,82 --> 00:31:50,39
that the council of all
beings can consist of all.
