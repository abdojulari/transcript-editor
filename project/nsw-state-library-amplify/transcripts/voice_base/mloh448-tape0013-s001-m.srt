1
00:00:02,5 --> 00:00:13,59
Or sit in the ears. C.E.C. Years between Sydney and Cambridge. If you still must you. Nice to meet Tom's ears is this.

2
00:00:14,27 --> 00:00:24,11
Split marriage and I want you to do the best you know that was that she would be to good schools to. Hear this is.

3
00:00:25,61 --> 00:00:32,35
What did you. There's a pretty low class at the Straits and.

4
00:00:34,57 --> 00:00:43,82
In later I got out of there as quickly as I possibly could and in the light a lot for lived at the end cross paths.

5
00:00:44,32 --> 00:00:45,85
Paddington. In that area.

6
00:00:47,75 --> 00:00:56,03
I was working came home to fall of the country tried and discovered that most of the the guy played used to.

7
00:00:56,8 --> 00:01:05,68
Meet in our park every not this is during the war. These were cratering. Yes in Sydney for that you would have.

8
00:01:07,26 --> 00:01:09,57
Yes Years east toward the east.

9
00:01:10,45 --> 00:01:15,53
Yeah there are those medically unfit for the previous year

10
00:01:15,53 --> 00:01:19,44
or so I think that was in the light part of the year in the east.

11
00:01:20,64 --> 00:01:26,75
And I was in the pipe in tried most of the year without a say but all the year.

12
00:01:26,76 --> 00:01:35,04
The guy played police even leading a rain hard every day not this was your first experience. We know or lace Yes.

13
00:01:36,36 --> 00:01:38,66
They'd make their on the states

14
00:01:38,66 --> 00:01:49,19
and they would have bought her she wanted the red have parties all fresco course there was a lot of sorting around the

15
00:01:49,19 --> 00:01:56,82
pathways with the ground round the sample and there was a young place cadets resting at least two

16
00:01:56,82 --> 00:02:01,09
or three every night they were the place cadets would get their room.

17
00:02:01,58 --> 00:02:04,52
But night wobble they Beyond's and for entrapment.

18
00:02:05,13 --> 00:02:11,05
And they'd be at least a couple arrested Renard course in those days they were getting three months in jail for

19
00:02:11,05 --> 00:02:20,46
rustlers sitting this floor was slight arrived and and talk on the air the lawful soliciting only pertained to.

20
00:02:21,63 --> 00:02:23,79
Pimps and prostitutes

21
00:02:24,46 --> 00:02:32,98
and it was ruled in the in the court that you could slip another main could solicit another man for himself.

22
00:02:33,6 --> 00:02:41,38
That was cost to them. Another one with broad day in which covered the decency then. Not long after that there was.

23
00:02:41,74 --> 00:02:46,98
People getting caught in drag their fears that was overturned because it was an.

24
00:02:47,42 --> 00:02:51,5
They used to be offensive that a person was dressed in women's clothes it was a humorous

25
00:02:51,5 --> 00:02:55,88
but wasn't offensive providing they weren't soliciting in as a woman

26
00:02:55,88 --> 00:03:05,63
and then the one to one accusations in the court that was also overt and because well that is not cooperation.

27
00:03:05,82 --> 00:03:10,18
Anyone can make in the could accuse anyone else for her sexually when it didn't exist.

28
00:03:10,55 --> 00:03:14,88
Earlier was a number of these returning a little

29
00:03:14,88 --> 00:03:19,94
but any right in the park there was anyone could a role if they were the couple bottles of plonk

30
00:03:19,94 --> 00:03:22,32
and would sit in the park and.

31
00:03:23,01 --> 00:03:31,63
And everyone had known the plumes of course in the old days there were such people is because the Russian mole floors

32
00:03:31,63 --> 00:03:40,74
the hour. Isabella Ilana McQuade Carson. Forever Ramba. Oh incidentally although the Russian model of the winter.

33
00:03:40,74 --> 00:03:49,84
Karun won a military middle. Years for brightly. A couple of years ago. What was involved at the Chinese is something.

34
00:03:49,95 --> 00:04:00,89
But anyway there was always characters and nice to sit in the city on the seats and greet plank and dance over the.

35
00:04:02,35 --> 00:04:07,59
And carry on regardless Lee of course the place to. Buy periodical rides through the park.

36
00:04:07,62 --> 00:04:16,28
One was a big fat bubble gum Sargent and and we have to run through the Baucus and Mary's Cathedral layer of the day

37
00:04:16,28 --> 00:04:17,71
and of the mind to get away from them.

38
00:04:17,87 --> 00:04:20,34
Usually they names and addresses

39
00:04:20,34 --> 00:04:25,62
but we've even more force ones anyway they'd be someplace in Sydney where they'd have stacks

40
00:04:25,62 --> 00:04:31,71
and stacks of false names and addresses but the position was then if you did give a true nine Crist's

41
00:04:31,71 --> 00:04:33,1
and place of work.

42
00:04:33,76 --> 00:04:40,05
The boss of a phone call the next day and you'd be dismissed or got three lost three jobs three it's.

43
00:04:42,14 --> 00:04:43,58
Cooking in Whitey.

44
00:04:43,89 --> 00:04:48,79
In the catering trade or in Sydney and when this board

45
00:04:48,79 --> 00:05:02,22
and the place stopped this publication in the truth at close was. At the we was it in. The Hotel in Sydney. Yeah.

46
00:05:02,99 --> 00:05:08,65
The green cynical course it's Italy was it what at the end of the sect on the spot on the Monday morning.

47
00:05:09,36 --> 00:05:10,84
Yeah well this is of this.

48
00:05:10,87 --> 00:05:13,36
Is that was the year the publication of the truth

49
00:05:13,36 --> 00:05:18,78
but in the raw yet I discovered in still in the parks the gardens building.

50
00:05:19,03 --> 00:05:26,89
In the lead of the family which had a sunken roof a little bit a four foot sunken roof on the top.

51
00:05:26,97 --> 00:05:32,53
So I discovered if we could put on the saw it in the place into the park we could run up there.

52
00:05:33,05 --> 00:05:37,65
Get beyond these but the parapet in the place of rod

53
00:05:37,65 --> 00:05:43,8
and starts joining torches around where the does this affect bubble bum sides and see it with a the bastards go

54
00:05:43,8 --> 00:05:47,47
and I go at Assad to go at the park and we all. Let him go.

55
00:05:47,52 --> 00:05:56,35
Brain I'm at the park and I come sundering back smashing through all the all the shrubbery and breaking flares

56
00:05:56,35 --> 00:06:07,88
and all that and one of the sergeants and the bass of the rap of the crazy one. We'll get to you. Cards. Can't wait.

57
00:06:07,89 --> 00:06:09,26
Now you're up there with the trophies.

58
00:06:09,33 --> 00:06:14,78
If you're ever going to hoard have a look at that in the shade I think they've got a lot of war

59
00:06:14,78 --> 00:06:19,48
and stuff on top of it and that small as we used to call to score a lot growth.

60
00:06:20,98 --> 00:06:25,26
It was a wonderful place we could sit up they have a dozen of us and replant you know like a number

61
00:06:25,26 --> 00:06:29,39
and I was the old one o'clock in the morning.

62
00:06:29,42 --> 00:06:33,35
So it was always Oh yes all the people writing

63
00:06:33,35 --> 00:06:39,18
and even light coming from the shows that we waiting at St James' station for the trains and that.

64
00:06:39,52 --> 00:06:45,96
And they do all the singing careers in going on in the parking lot so we rightly in the front of the book if it's I

65
00:06:45,96 --> 00:06:51,33
didn't know what these people were we thought we were Luminol for my thoughts but it's

66
00:06:51,33 --> 00:06:56,12
but mediately they call the place. This is the place it comes through.

67
00:06:56,77 --> 00:07:04,92
Of course it was arraigned a bit larger in the four. Just before the end of the world just shortly.

68
00:07:05,04 --> 00:07:14,3
Just or in that town where there was two detective sergeants was on the public the public toilet late

69
00:07:14,3 --> 00:07:22,1
and I accosted the main public toilet and accused him of indecency and they pulled him aside

70
00:07:22,1 --> 00:07:26,44
and said Now for a certain amount of money even if you get all of it is

71
00:07:26,44 --> 00:07:37,69
and because you were exposing yourself in the public told him to do it at those. At the Juran. The only way.

72
00:07:38,49 --> 00:07:44,52
The fellow is along with this and he said Well I haven't got the money on me but I will.

73
00:07:44,93 --> 00:07:53,36
HAVE A Tomorrow night a way can we meet. So we use the meeting place was Julie. There Rob.

74
00:07:53,75 --> 00:08:01,01
And after a short conversation the money was handed over and then an inspector placed popped out of the blue.

75
00:08:01,37 --> 00:08:07,35
He'd recorded all the conversation and he singles Siegel rather than your place to movie.

76
00:08:08,95 --> 00:08:13,86
Rock mission coming out of it and the two detectives were.

77
00:08:16,09 --> 00:08:22,43
Just dismissed from the force but they put but I think they had a better twenty four of years each in superannuation.

78
00:08:22,83 --> 00:08:28,7
So they put down the drive in the main it was nameless Makai.

79
00:08:30,72 --> 00:08:37,56
And he was the London native there of the telegraph and he'd just come from a city dealing with this war if

80
00:08:37,59 --> 00:08:45,79
and he left a momentary momentarily in the car. To go to the top to relieve yourself in that pic a very nasty.

81
00:08:46,79 --> 00:08:54,57
It was extortion was there an explosion. But anyway you are saying the great lead for an organized.

82
00:08:56,47 --> 00:09:05,74
Get together as you know with a bit of music and fraud he said he not Benson and promised to do the release wiki

83
00:09:06,29 --> 00:09:11,33
and done nothing. Makes a resource that for getting things only way.

84
00:09:13,31 --> 00:09:16,44
US evolved or does it all get a hole in an old poster.

85
00:09:16,73 --> 00:09:26,89
So all the noise this within the play tend it's got a booking at the glade ten whole rang the blarney says instituted

86
00:09:26,89 --> 00:09:33,44
as the heavenly blonde musicians you know will tell them to do stuff that if they won bonus was of course I couldn't

87
00:09:33,44 --> 00:09:40,26
say but we're talking super model but still don't know like the big is the selves that blow

88
00:09:40,26 --> 00:09:47,79
and sell just you know like even two birds to kill one stand but only right now bury you. Where was that head the.

89
00:09:48,92 --> 00:09:53,89
Pretty good because the news of the to the Truth newspaper was sniffing a range.

90
00:09:54,19 --> 00:10:02,12
And asking questions and who would Martin weigh at this time in the form of Steve's all secret. No. What a new.

91
00:10:03,48 --> 00:10:11,35
All up with having stage personnel and radio personalities literally cracking Minnick to get an invitation.

92
00:10:11,45 --> 00:10:12,54
It was that sacred

93
00:10:12,72 --> 00:10:20,64
and everyone was very bohemian like let the devil take the test these days you have six they are some of the sleaze all

94
00:10:21,4 --> 00:10:28,76
all it is become black. But then there was a certain man to secrecy and is rather different.

95
00:10:30,02 --> 00:10:37,85
So anyway I ordered the whole Anyway I walked in the Australia. The straight out tail of the too long.

96
00:10:39,31 --> 00:10:43,14
And set the morning in just the stupid of the invitations

97
00:10:43,95 --> 00:10:51,51
and one says How the hell can we get the if we don't with good hits. Tell you said the moon.

98
00:10:52,35 --> 00:10:56,15
In its own way but the not guilty agent.

99
00:10:56,77 --> 00:11:02,25
So I walked in there set him only Where is it glued kennels starts died clock cost

100
00:11:02,25 --> 00:11:08,09
and it was a rush everyone at get you know they have to run it and get things and people have to go

101
00:11:08,09 --> 00:11:14,59
and get their week's done up and all this sort of business and and dregs of the usually only worn sacred bread

102
00:11:14,59 --> 00:11:26,55
and on and up the river hall to the. There was the archbishop of camper Rob He was of the from Priest. Or somebody.

103
00:11:27,31 --> 00:11:33,96
I think was a little boy says something that some church. He'd rather to six foot candle sticks.

104
00:11:34,52 --> 00:11:43,06
I don't know where we caught him from. And he was in full regalia. And we've of course had the wedding in N.F.L.

105
00:11:43,06 --> 00:11:47,34
Broad and six broad my. And as they come from the supper room up.

106
00:11:48,31 --> 00:11:53,91
They sprinkled all the perfect him over them and all that sort of business and there was Dolly dimples

107
00:11:53,91 --> 00:12:01,14
and it was Georgie and we had some old lesbians there also they were in Texas these days and.

108
00:12:01,52 --> 00:12:09,94
Yes it was very full most of them. And they provided a couple of thoughts during the night as. Terry close in that but.

109
00:12:10,93 --> 00:12:21,61
Then Tony Moore It's Tony Tony then would be willing to use fifty's course we're only twenty's. And. Tony would do.

110
00:12:21,63 --> 00:12:25,54
He's famous Rose of Picotee course.

111
00:12:26,04 --> 00:12:32,34
Tony was one of the all smart said diggers in the not in fortnight in ball in the Smart League is the show

112
00:12:32,34 --> 00:12:39,59
and Tony struck the as I've been told by other already is that he'd stop the shower.

113
00:12:39,79 --> 00:12:47,5
Convalescent came in France were at a theater in the grand finale he walked to the back.

114
00:12:48,18 --> 00:12:51,52
With a criminal in with a large basket of roses

115
00:12:51,52 --> 00:13:06,46
and threw them into the audience singing Rose if so of course this was is this was these usual song. And it's. Very.

116
00:13:06,96 --> 00:13:07,9
Oh yes Tony

117
00:13:07,9 --> 00:13:15,21
or tourney he'd be year he'd be in the six fifties lights for sixty's series a bigger in the First World War

118
00:13:15,21 --> 00:13:23,79
and of course those times just after the war there was the Trocadero in Sydney they had the big artist in their pursuit.

119
00:13:24,53 --> 00:13:31,38
Event that the gave in to the course there was no other place to go if there was even a coffee shop open for gay people

120
00:13:31,38 --> 00:13:35,76
like the shutters had come down within twenty four hours. So anyway.

121
00:13:37,17 --> 00:13:45,4
Ray cleverly was always always one the the belle of the ball either Roy playing technican with this messy crinoline

122
00:13:45,4 --> 00:13:51,74
and hard headed we in the we get headlights in it was operated by a bet recently

123
00:13:51,74 --> 00:14:01,07
and a mess of costume always the political course it was a lot of jealousy associated with right cleverly so can.

124
00:14:01,16 --> 00:14:08,05
I'm a race with these things. Gratian darling twenty models said I'll give that bastard something for each corner.

125
00:14:08,66 --> 00:14:16,78
So one night we went window shopping Sunday night in the city the neighbors the window display of a bed a dozen stuff.

126
00:14:16,91 --> 00:14:20,26
Birds of Paradise and peacocks.

127
00:14:21,96 --> 00:14:24,89
The next thing of course I wasn't involved at all

128
00:14:24,89 --> 00:14:29,76
but the next morning I heard that there'd been a special grab in the center of the city.

129
00:14:31,41 --> 00:14:33,5
And the place the completely mystified.

130
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:43,22
They was all the birds the wind moldy al the and leave the place didn't know what to make of it

131
00:14:43,22 --> 00:14:50,78
but at the next start as ball a rock magnificent You ought to say he was preggers from head to toe.

132
00:14:50,82 --> 00:14:59,63
He looked like the really lit the royalist the ship. He was Fred as if with. Belittle. Claudia.

133
00:15:00,05 --> 00:15:10,69
Nearly got pink to the next year because he arrived he was defended in twenty fifth as he rubbed with the with the

134
00:15:10,69 --> 00:15:15,04
Benton rooster on his head place his lawyers and in the truth.

135
00:15:15,06 --> 00:15:20,18
The next day although a couple of days after it was the Irish place E.I.O.

136
00:15:20,18 --> 00:15:29,29
To question him a bit using laws of the race but. Ice in the great need for the East after the.

137
00:15:29,5 --> 00:15:34,22
After the Vivian Leigh's waiting at the gate in will and it was full broad

138
00:15:34,22 --> 00:15:40,9
and begged all the the two to Dole is been ZWAR attacks the days and tiles

139
00:15:40,9 --> 00:15:46,74
and there's a new nine weeks ago our little red took two together.

140
00:15:48,61 --> 00:15:55,85
Is a pretty don't leave that's the name that's tonight you see a lot of these old guy street names of gone in all

142
00:16:10,07 --> 00:16:17,37
But then after that they all seem to come out of the bloody wood work after the Vivian lady waiting there was the ashes

143
00:16:17,37 --> 00:16:27,7
in the city there's ashes and. The carton. Suppose the. Everyone wanted to learn to do was a complete mystery.

144
00:16:27,96 --> 00:16:35,5
You know what was going on because when then it took off this was in not in forty five. After that run of the Eureka.

145
00:16:37,71 --> 00:16:41,52
Hall is a small predicate and it was the original youth.

146
00:16:41,66 --> 00:16:49,02
Communist party youth all around that Christ's birth and fear scares of fights.

147
00:16:50,15 --> 00:16:55,96
The bottles and people getting the dregs torn off and all that but that's all. When it was part and parcel of it.

148
00:16:57,85 --> 00:17:03,09
Over there was part and parcel everyone enjoyed the. You know a bit of rough.

149
00:17:03,13 --> 00:17:06,52
Yes there was none of the silver tea service with us.

00:17:16,68 --> 00:17:22,36
Next thing thought she was going to rue St The pool by the Sydney's Elsom next.

00:20:26,03 --> 00:20:30,64
There were frying bottles in the mirrors on the walls being smashed up was lovely. It was rough.

179
00:20:30,67 --> 00:20:35,01
They are seen now before that play out in the dance of the seven Viles this is the last.

180
00:20:35,55 --> 00:20:39,00
Slip the way they click the lights had just to leave enough to reach.

181
00:20:40,01 --> 00:20:46,51
Then then the next of the hot to the uproar mixing got on the dice

182
00:20:46,51 --> 00:20:49,74

184
00:20:54,11 --> 00:21:01,78
Anyway mixing go to the like I call them the face whipped off the weed and mixing the six foot through in a big long

185
00:21:01,78 --> 00:21:09,02
and joined in the fart Romanesque who got knocked out in one slithering along with four engraved with a dress up

186
00:21:09,02 --> 00:21:12,54
or A and B. but She had no one to paint so in this. It was a.

187
00:21:14,93 --> 00:21:21,57
Moving time to go through the winder up and running around to see all in the air.

188
00:21:22,22 --> 00:21:27,72
And just as we got through the window of the gunnies the lodge went out again on the ganas lit floor over the joints

189
00:21:27,72 --> 00:21:34,8
two tons of flame in the room to. The shut to shut fart in the box as if at least I'm getting it.

190
00:21:34,89 --> 00:21:40,42
So we run along the the orning was too far to drop to the dish so there was another wind direction.

191
00:21:40,46 --> 00:21:45,15
Sosa Quick's Arcus see the whole lot through the door.

192
00:21:45,16 --> 00:21:50,88
Why it is that it was another flat children more screaming from the occupants didn't we.

193
00:21:51,06 --> 00:22:01,04
We've run look at this bit of still a bottle of water up to no Sydney station and Mildred. She said give you a.

194
00:22:01,46 --> 00:22:07,66
To a social class they've only special guests were lucky to get his vehicle.

195
00:22:09,15 --> 00:22:15,83
Was to look back it is still a screaming in the smashing of bottles and the police car off and that was

196
00:22:15,83 --> 00:22:22,07
when it was very one of. Mixing Benson's evenings. Of course next in it at any rental party after.

197
00:22:24,49 --> 00:22:29,09
I think there's a better sales and hands damage was all noisy take the nature.

198
00:22:29,24 --> 00:22:34,95
You know mirrors on the wall and someone fell into the into the baby grand piano.

199
00:22:35,47 --> 00:22:41,65
Then there was the Gaiety Ballroom around that there was in not in forty nine after this truth.

200
00:22:41,68 --> 00:22:48,2
Tonight it's out and there was the rest. So hold it more like that was northern forty seven.

201
00:22:48,21 --> 00:22:57,64
Then there was the Hollywood tennis courts hall that was in forty nine. That was. There was also in Concord.

202
00:22:58,09 --> 00:23:05,86
And there was the another to turn it in forty seven of the larger hall of believe that this lovely.

203
00:23:06,27 --> 00:23:08,74
There was a frost that was in very little bit. So the fog.

204
00:23:09,02 --> 00:23:16,62
But it paid for the orchestra and it was bring your own of course there was still ahead bet far past parties included.

205
00:23:16,83 --> 00:23:20,21
There was there was a large cast a that was left to have

206
00:23:20,21 --> 00:23:27,08
and there was the white lifters so the whole Could Gee that that was dandy the year that it was a small

207
00:23:27,08 --> 00:23:33,62
but it was very nice beat cranky ever in the bar the best three o'clock in the morning

208
00:23:33,62 --> 00:23:41,81
and it was the best on the Balmoral big party. This was really something. It was very. It was very.

209
00:23:42,61 --> 00:23:49,43
Very risque and it would have you know I've got someone contacted me either.

210
00:23:49,56 --> 00:23:52,65
His name was meek he does the game leave the lead arrive.

211
00:23:53,44 --> 00:24:00,91
Every crossness way so he said No you said Bring a few feel your friends a reset for.

212
00:24:01,83 --> 00:24:07,93
This is to pick a dozen of them obese Navarrete and if it loses all four plod in

213
00:24:08,37 --> 00:24:16,76
and we'll never know our story came to a bit of music and in a lucky. As it now Bash now beshrew owner.

214
00:24:16,98 --> 00:24:23,23
He said Oh I run the ship it really is on the game later. But he getting close. Probably chief.

215
00:24:23,31 --> 00:24:37,05
You know with the ruby ours isn't it would take three. So I can take. Susan places that did. It was the.

216
00:24:39,41 --> 00:24:46,78
Doris sweeps away day. And oh that was six dogs that.

217
00:24:48,15 --> 00:24:56,54
Well there wasn't going to be a party of twenty or so when we arrived at the till it was a bit.

218
00:24:57,88 --> 00:25:07,72
Forty fifty young lads from that area all whitey to get out and she hears the wind up. He said to Jesus.

219
00:25:08,08 --> 00:25:18,49
See I'm uneasy. The only way we can get a house that hard to get into build but each day get up in a little G.

220
00:25:18,49 --> 00:25:25,41
and Go there was people bodies strictures went into the breach to if the police would rob the route it wouldn't do to

221
00:25:25,41 --> 00:25:32,9
Peter. That was the Belmore of bleach it. Written a bit that there was.

222
00:25:33,18 --> 00:25:45,41
And of course of course if they was Russell Norton's finest little parties that ran the crusts which crossing I'd been

223
00:25:45,41 --> 00:25:54,66
there for at least a dozen times to this it first two straight then there was another all the hast standbys water right

224
00:25:54,66 --> 00:26:03,28
where he had the kep the co-chairs at the back. It was night it was a stable.

225
00:26:03,65 --> 00:26:12,45
Yes night it into your in our studio and of course. With her friend it was a fella called green glass.

226
00:26:12,48 --> 00:26:20,79
I think it was the city now. He was described boy at the gay people as Nashville and we make listen.

227
00:26:23,96 --> 00:26:30,44
Well when we division these lul day insisted nothing on you going to stay in the mess killer would make innocent.

228
00:26:31,93 --> 00:26:40,26
So there was always there was always place driving at rallies places that confiscating photographs of course green

229
00:26:40,26 --> 00:26:48,33
glass was the that the model for me had a very athletic body for years and she'd point even rude

230
00:26:48,51 --> 00:26:51,02
and put a big Graeme's head or a bull's head on it.

231
00:26:51,78 --> 00:26:58,94
Which was incapable of course of the heat of the subject and the place was the objection objectionable an obscene

232
00:26:58,94 --> 00:27:03,1
and public talking of the days when even the.

233
00:27:04,17 --> 00:27:10,08
The nude from the Sydney gallery were moved Lindsay's paintings were you removed from the Sydney gallery a gallery is

234
00:27:10,08 --> 00:27:13,78
being obscene the civic fathers

235
00:27:13,78 --> 00:27:21,18
and bluenoses even ordered that the that the year of the classical Greek statues in the Sydney botanical gardens have

236
00:27:21,18 --> 00:27:28,91
masonry figleaves fitted to protect the morals of the little kiddies. It was and I both on the third week.

237
00:27:30,23 --> 00:27:36,51
I even suggested the people memorial phantom be covered with some sort put under paints

238
00:27:36,51 --> 00:27:43,00
and go on the inner of the chase and centaurs and they centaurs in that underpants be placed on them.

239
00:27:43,31 --> 00:27:44,47
It was absurd

240
00:27:44,58 --> 00:27:53,57
and now of course we all know about that terrible author who wrote a lovely silence that practically nailed him to the

241
00:27:53,57 --> 00:28:01,69
cross and to guide us it's really very odd that book. Wrote Rosie I'd never say nothing gives. Nothing.

242
00:28:02,65 --> 00:28:07,29
Rossi Nortons price that suggested black masses in the press this always pushing these.

243
00:28:08,8 --> 00:28:19,62
Black masses and the devil worship but no no no no. It was all a rush. The media came T. It was all the plank.

244
00:28:21,59 --> 00:28:26,18
If you lock a little bit on the sargent lying around in the cushions and lean since burning

245
00:28:26,45 --> 00:28:33,83
and it was other strange aromatic too if you wished. Of course the Americans introduced us to this.

246
00:28:33,89 --> 00:28:38,94
I think they called it Potter to Luna or something like smoke smoke it a part of it.

247
00:28:39,66 --> 00:28:48,62
And turns up in the cause we get happened to a rough day incident green glass had come at the head a monkey in the

248
00:28:48,62 --> 00:28:50,51
snake it will be in the day but there is.

249
00:28:51,3 --> 00:28:58,65
The Eagles close in a few bottles of the preserves but there is nothing like black nests they pull ridiculous.

250
00:29:01,5 --> 00:29:09,82
Own very heavily God loved loved gay people and on the dollar of rallies that was.

251
00:29:10,6 --> 00:29:19,43
All Russell Norton this year who could see what was it. Oh yes you Chris.

252
00:29:19,48 --> 00:29:24,56
Oh yes three years roll is what was in was one

253
00:29:24,56 --> 00:29:32,62
or two very important a guy paid for years because Rosie was Roee all Rosie was before her time.

254
00:29:33,84 --> 00:29:47,81
To love the Evan guy the the Belle he. In her subsequently pieties. Quite famous one part of a wooden rose in winter.

255
00:29:47,89 --> 00:29:53,25
You get sick to death of the persecution Sydney went to South Australia

256
00:29:53,25 --> 00:30:00,97
and held an exhibition over there in was arrested for obscene paintings bought places. And then the angel can.

257
00:30:01,16 --> 00:30:09,59
Bishop of Adelaide who bought one and he started in cotton wool the tells the court that.

258
00:30:10,58 --> 00:30:18,02
The evil was in the arms of the holder that he he thought it was great or that there was nothing there to Paul.

259
00:30:18,74 --> 00:30:23,47
There's nothing suggestive see if you look at something. It was a general episode totally up to the person.

260
00:30:23,69 --> 00:30:32,82
The only way that they didn't. Rosie was that they were very very evident it was over before they put on.

261
00:30:34,3 --> 00:30:45,46
Is there a trick. Choosing a very unusual piece is usually has a safe. Because she called a spade a spade.

262
00:30:45,91 --> 00:30:52,46
She would never mean store fritted was with us what she meant she met and that was it but.

263
00:30:53,05 --> 00:30:58,17
If she fancies you should want to she'd put it straight away to be painted in the know it.

264
00:30:58,35 --> 00:31:07,56
But her mind was great as he was not that sort of that it can speculative. Then the rest of it.

265
00:31:07,63 --> 00:31:11,47
That was the place it was the music placed in a little rose straight Sydney.

266
00:31:11,65 --> 00:31:20,08
It was a music's you simple rooted music studio is involved in the student piano. It's all there's a place you go.

267
00:31:20,21 --> 00:31:25,88
They have a set. They know it and strip off and lay around on the captions in and burn incense and listen to class.

268
00:31:25,9 --> 00:31:32,97
It was a big to harbor. At the edge to resign. But it all ended up in that. Rock.

269
00:31:33,25 --> 00:31:42,08
Of sorts that was in Little Rock Street and there was a taint ring tendering started. Going against it.

270
00:31:42,1 --> 00:31:51,6
Fifty one had done later show and. About anywhere else in the lane Lord next door coming out of the shotgun and.

271
00:31:52,22 --> 00:31:58,44
Start far easier shots and. So I just get this straight.

272
00:32:01,68 --> 00:32:09,06
Oh noes the roast roast great was was there a series of rooms in the large building was like an academy you know if

273
00:32:09,44 --> 00:32:15,29
they all had root to teach volley in piano and all that but one large studio catches a ramp

274
00:32:15,59 --> 00:32:19,25
and you get down the oversexed they know I can take a bottle of plonk in that now

275
00:32:19,25 --> 00:32:27,41
but no dancing now I read a bit you could just lie around and just fainted in the ninety's. And. It was yes.

276
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:36,89
But that was back to the interests of all of them and some inner city and they were one of the could play the piano.

277
00:32:37,51 --> 00:32:50,6
It was a very special. Business. Now not only. Were you talking at the time. Practicing cigarettes the spirit.

278
00:32:54,72 --> 00:33:03,82
Oh and the end of the roast roast straight. They'd be on the bed pretty good. They're very sexual. Yes this is.

279
00:33:05,49 --> 00:33:16,13
Yes early fifty's Tri-State diverse large building. Their Own. Piano Bar. There's this different group.

280
00:33:16,82 --> 00:33:25,92
You know at the top where like going to make you know a lot of nice touch pics of Bollywood classics. Let me.

281
00:33:25,95 --> 00:33:27,02
John Smiths

282
00:33:27,3 --> 00:33:38,18
and I just had about building a big goals case smelling of style you're on where you want to go again you know there

283
00:33:38,18 --> 00:33:43,12
was the we got to the the the Golden Circle which was all the girls

284
00:33:43,12 --> 00:33:49,08
and so it was all professional men from this is what I did a lot

285
00:33:49,19 --> 00:33:55,04
and he wanted to know the nature of the from he wanted me to do that it was more like to come up the Middle East

286
00:33:55,04 --> 00:34:01,07
and I wasn't terribly pleased with it. This is locked away. I'll tell you what. One.

287
00:34:01,16 --> 00:34:03,03
I ended up a Supreme Court judge

288
00:34:03,56 --> 00:34:10,76
and it was several barristers just couple of specialist doctors from Corey straight to.

289
00:34:12,1 --> 00:34:19,81
One case they were there was one magistrate the senators came to me to was trying to pick the one that before you break

290
00:34:19,81 --> 00:34:27,28
even the minimum and then there's remembers the his representatives one of them. One of them.

291
00:34:28,63 --> 00:34:36,71
Jordan from where we were going to go. To Gollum's they had a cruise. They had a large.

292
00:34:37,44 --> 00:34:46,76
A large American vessel border raised by i go of that have to boyfriends and I get a cruise at the parametric river.

293
00:34:47,05 --> 00:34:49,8
It was that not all of cover of law.

294
00:34:49,81 --> 00:34:57,59
It's all you can drag it was very and shame party course are going to be brought into one of them at economy so.

295
00:34:59,34 --> 00:35:01,9
Typical.

296
00:35:02,34 --> 00:35:03,03
Course the rough

297
00:35:03,03 --> 00:35:09,91
and ready to go during this is the super tease of this which hits the related deaths you know looks just to.

298
00:35:10,33 --> 00:35:14,29
Too much silver of the gold and the gold and says.

299
00:35:15,11 --> 00:35:22,39
Of course we're there we're here at one of them had an apartment at the building which up.

300
00:35:23,3 --> 00:35:27,22
Now with the stink part is the clear Petra's needle in our.

Those we could cost a hundred fifty two hundred was naturally two hundred pounds two hundred

He said he said this is this is the young jockeys rice for the. Course always suspected it was all lies.

375
00:43:49,9 --> 00:43:52,82

and he said no you don't want the world to not just have it all just to play in the year that he was gay at.

377
00:44:01,51 --> 00:44:05,59
And that things that goes on in life styles it tells a few stories.

378
00:44:10,43 --> 00:44:17,35
Where we got the information the not for the doctors there was a panic in bus on the walls he was going to leave the

00:44:31,77 --> 00:44:38,92
and got seven to one. Well you were saying the Reisa did look from the start because we knew it was wrong.

382
00:44:39,1 --> 00:44:42,35

00:44:43,63 --> 00:44:49,14
The horse coming around the series the barrier the horse hit the front of the back six and run

and come over the Royce and stay there in the seat of the other jockeys when to crawl into or to kick today that.

385
00:44:58,98 --> 00:45:00,06
Not it was so obvious
