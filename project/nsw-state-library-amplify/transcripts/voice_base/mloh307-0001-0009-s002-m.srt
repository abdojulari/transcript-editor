1
00:00:13,92 --> 00:00:20,78
Section eight tape eight side two. So I was thinking this morning.

2
00:00:20,79 --> 00:00:31,82
We've had periods in our history when really we had to bow our heads in shame. Just as it was in Minsk in.

3
00:00:33,83 --> 00:00:44,00
Cutting off this country from the world except the queen. The queen's footstools that's what we were.

4
00:00:45,36 --> 00:00:53,12
And it's happening again today. I think in the periods when I travelled extensively.

5
00:00:53,14 --> 00:01:03,4
After Menzies and have proud of us for instance to be able as I go through customs to show my passport.

6
00:01:03,71 --> 00:01:16,96
I'm an Australian. I'm ashamed of and. So those days of the Cold War. Do a favor to steering within me.

7
00:01:16,98 --> 00:01:29,65
Now when I parted with before I went to him he was going to test me. To a job because he couldn't get a job here.

8
00:01:31,47 --> 00:01:35,71
Professional people had to do that. And so.

9
00:01:37,56 --> 00:01:44,28
I was going to the headquarters which was somewhere near the quay if I remember correctly.

10
00:01:44,3 --> 00:01:56,03
To sort of get involved and do something for the festival. And who should I run into in the street.

11
00:01:57,4 --> 00:02:01,34
And he'd lost his job in Tasmania because they said he was a security risk.

12
00:02:02,62 --> 00:02:08,88
And he'd come back again he'd got a job in the meantime in a small engineering place at Crow's Nest.

13
00:02:09,99 --> 00:02:17,11
But he still had his very lovely flat at North Sydney. And he said to me remember this.

14
00:02:18,42 --> 00:02:27,32
And there was nothing between us before. It was just sort of made once or twice that was all.

15
00:02:28,78 --> 00:02:36,76
They knew we made in Pitts trade. And he welcomed me with open arms and he said Oh he said.

16
00:02:38,39 --> 00:02:41,82
I've taken back my subscription tickets to the concert.

17
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:50,43
Would you like to come such and such an act and his night was Saturday night and man by Saturday night

18
00:02:50,43 --> 00:02:51,84
and I said to him.

19
00:02:51,85 --> 00:02:59,98
Well I got tickets for Saturday night and he said oh OK but I won't take any one of Will make for supper.

20
00:02:59,99 --> 00:03:17,7
Well I used to go alone. There is just something in me into a concert in. With a person who breathes. Music as it were.

21
00:03:18,69 --> 00:03:30,39
So. And so we went to the concert and we went to the Monterey.

22
00:03:30,41 --> 00:03:39,84
You know the Monterey was the place where you had a heart. With ice cream and maple syrup.

23
00:03:39,85 --> 00:03:51,27
And the bass copy in town except for rep and. We had coffee and then he said to me I've bought some land.

24
00:03:51,28 --> 00:04:00,85
And I'd like to take you and show you this. He said when the when the festival is.

25
00:04:00,87 --> 00:04:09,86
And Helms was working very hard for the festival creating a magnificent design of Austria.

26
00:04:10,49 --> 00:04:17,12
Where certain things are grown in geographically it for was beautiful and very informative.

27
00:04:17,5 --> 00:04:26,09
And he together with a group of other professionals were working on it all for the festival.

28
00:04:27,68 --> 00:04:34,83
He said When the festival is over we'll take you out and show you the land and our cigarette.

29
00:04:35,82 --> 00:04:57,85
I think will entertain have coffee. So the first of all that.

30
00:04:59,58 --> 00:05:11,31
One couldn't really call it a great occasion stuck out there in Fairfield of all places that. Anyhow. Well by there.

31
00:05:13,01 --> 00:05:15,24
I was living.

32
00:05:15,25 --> 00:05:27,31
In right at the bottom Street and the landlady and landlord lived in Hama Street just around the corner from me.

33
00:05:28,31 --> 00:05:35,95
And they were both particularly the woman was very involved in the peace movement also which was very unusual.

34
00:05:35,97 --> 00:05:47,16
But her husband was. A slum landlord and. Many houses in mine in Paddington which were considered slums at that time.

35
00:05:47,65 --> 00:05:59,81
If you please. They were indeed not so much. But in mine. That's certainly one of my. Paddington.

36
00:06:00,59 --> 00:06:09,21
She was a lovely woman who had a family of five children. I think. And he must have and twenty or thirty.

37
00:06:09,99 --> 00:06:24,32
Round place all over the place. He came from Finland. And I lived down there in fourth Street.

38
00:06:24,34 --> 00:06:30,85
So how many tickets in the place for a concert. Who to a concert.

39
00:06:32,18 --> 00:06:38,55
And he said Well tomorrow I'm going out to the block that's what we always call it

40
00:06:38,55 --> 00:06:51,58
when people began by land they were almost took up the block out of town he didn't have a car. And. I said I K.

41
00:06:51,58 --> 00:06:58,00
So I packed lunch and picked him up from North Sydney and we got the train to Chatswood

42
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:08,25
and the bus from Chet's went up to. French's forest and then we had about a mile to walk to the block. And I was.

43
00:07:09,91 --> 00:07:11,63
Taken with the beauty of the place.

44
00:07:12,88 --> 00:07:26,86
It was the flowers were just absolutely magnificent and now here is where the House is going to be and you know what.

45
00:07:29,61 --> 00:07:32,71
That day or couple a couple of weekends after that

46
00:07:32,71 --> 00:07:37,01
when we were out the architect came out near the architect happen to be.

47
00:07:37,48 --> 00:07:46,75
A person who was also involved in the festival. And he did it. Job for a parent or something. Drew up the plaque.

48
00:07:47,46 --> 00:07:59,43
For the house and then I have to work at they now have to clean and prepare the ground for the foundations

49
00:08:00,12 --> 00:08:02,03
and I just found myself working with him.

50
00:08:03,09 --> 00:08:12,73
And I had a lot of very very happy for her digging for the foundations clearing and dignified and. And.

51
00:08:12,75 --> 00:08:20,36
There was no water. Of course some interest in the heart of the bush. But at the very bottom of the hill.

52
00:08:21,91 --> 00:08:28,46
There was there was a lovely stream that went down on the most formed beautiful pool of the part of the hill.

53
00:08:29,37 --> 00:08:40,32
So once hundreds began to lay the bricks for the foundation. It was mine to up to carry the water for the cement.

54
00:08:41,28 --> 00:08:45,79
And there was a lot of bartering here. That was going on in like it.

55
00:08:46,94 --> 00:08:52,65
Most weekends we'd have extra people who were just friends who'd worked a day in the bush

56
00:08:52,65 --> 00:08:59,13
and I'd give a hand with mixing the concrete. Laying the bricks and all that kind of thing.

57
00:08:59,96 --> 00:09:03,95
And Marge of course to carry water and make sure they were fed well.

58
00:09:05,44 --> 00:09:13,96
And there was a very good friend a neighbor in Sydney who would pick up the meat if we can get a half a lamb

59
00:09:13,96 --> 00:09:22,71
or something like that that was divided up into three lot and I would take him says Lot up to the forest and.

60
00:09:24,33 --> 00:09:29,2
Cook the chops for whoever was giving. But for the house.

61
00:09:29,21 --> 00:09:36,02
And we had some marvelous there and then Hunt said Well what say we can help a little more often

62
00:09:36,02 --> 00:09:47,26
and he had a three man table which is still left in the cupboard which I had to have. And so we began came up there.

63
00:09:47,27 --> 00:09:58,56
Well behind this and in June seemed the month of June came and when we got married and Margaret Fulton was my.

64
00:09:59,74 --> 00:10:15,46
Witness firsthand as witness and we went to the registrar made it all legal and. I had an unplanned waiting breakfast.

65
00:10:15,47 --> 00:10:23,57
I was still hanging on to my house. Because I'd buy them in a few months after I'd moved in.

66
00:10:24,86 --> 00:10:32,62
I actually got a house and back on my own around Tree Street I saw the house the other day.

67
00:10:34,12 --> 00:10:36,47
It hasn't been enlarged in any way.

68
00:10:37,27 --> 00:10:49,29
So I hang on to the house fearing Well if the marriage doesn't last at least I've got my house. That's what I thought.

69
00:10:50,22 --> 00:11:03,43
And I'm not going to give it up so I put I sublet it to him. Just in case things didn't work.

70
00:11:04,56 --> 00:11:11,73
When we got married we went back to have it all the previous night.

71
00:11:11,74 --> 00:11:15,69
Margaret said to me a couple of not before but Margaret's into me.

72
00:11:15,7 --> 00:11:20,28
What are you going to efface we're I said Margaret that maybe sort of mark.

73
00:11:20,34 --> 00:11:25,69
Oh you can't wear that outfit to get married. Did it might be the only time in your life you get married.

74
00:11:27,13 --> 00:11:34,02
You got to have a decent well have father was Italian and she could so's Well if you could cook.

75
00:11:34,03 --> 00:11:41,22
And she said made up quickly to get some nice fabric.

76
00:11:41,65 --> 00:11:53,51
And cut this out and ran out up that night and it had hand sewing with alarming and I did that part of it

77
00:11:53,51 --> 00:12:07,13
and that was my wedding suit proposed. First and gray. So. And then she said well you will break the hilt.

78
00:12:07,17 --> 00:12:14,05
I suddenly thought about a breakfast. You have to have just after breakfast.

79
00:12:15,62 --> 00:12:22,04
Well that she had just started working in her kitchen for Women's Day.

80
00:12:22,06 --> 00:12:27,11
Which was quite a magazine different to what the rubbish.

81
00:12:27,9 --> 00:12:35,01
And she prepared the breakfast in her kitchen and handed over to her flat.

82
00:12:35,03 --> 00:12:40,23
And there we had Lynne Fox MARGARET You couldn't who is my fairy godmother.

83
00:12:41,22 --> 00:12:48,09
Who came down with a wedding present a present of a pressure cooker. Something that I have forgotten.

84
00:12:49,46 --> 00:13:00,09
And I suppose you know all the boys have been say six of us. We had this pattern and these my.

85
00:13:00,11 --> 00:13:03,82
Fresh cream cakes with Drury.

86
00:13:04,62 --> 00:13:10,86
Was wonderful and I always recall hand saying oh my coffee and Margaret followed him into the kitchen.

87
00:13:11,37 --> 00:13:20,62
You can't use that on this cafes and she brought good coffee Granny didn't use the well that was waiting

88
00:13:20,62 --> 00:13:29,28
and I still hung on to the house and because I thought this MARTIN Don't be too sure.

89
00:13:30,68 --> 00:13:41,87
And said the first year was very rocky thirty two for you and I and independent

90
00:13:41,88 --> 00:13:55,1
and I never expected anything from like most brides would. And I got to that house. You never know. So.

91
00:13:55,12 --> 00:14:11,41
Fifty two what men think if you. Yes that's right. So I wish and work to show. Factory to get a lot of money.

92
00:14:13,88 --> 00:14:21,98
And I paid the rain while Hans put his salary into the material for the house at the printers forest

93
00:14:21,98 --> 00:14:32,74
and it worked very well and for five years every year every week in we went out to.

94
00:14:32,75 --> 00:14:41,24
And then the work the terrible fires in the house in the forest and since our house escaped.

95
00:14:41,62 --> 00:14:46,43
We thought it was time to go and live in and quite finished by.

96
00:14:47,24 --> 00:14:53,85
It was beautiful just lovely living in the heart of the forest and the closest neighbors in half a mile away.

97
00:14:54,15 --> 00:14:58,64
What have you and people in fridges forest who were living there then

98
00:14:58,64 --> 00:15:03,35
and there were very few thought that we were quite Applecross to build it in that house.

99
00:15:03,46 --> 00:15:06,32
You know they had Fibro batter boxes.

100
00:15:06,6 --> 00:15:15,45
They'd both the land because it was still oh yes we're not going to look at it one day when you've got.

101
00:15:15,47 --> 00:15:22,55
And little goes out and drives past and has a look. So we lived in that house for thirteen here.

102
00:15:23,91 --> 00:15:34,43
And really we wanted to get into the International School which was very close to Macquarie University

103
00:15:35,79 --> 00:15:38,15
and so we thought to get her there.

104
00:15:38,32 --> 00:15:45,63
We've got to move house and that was the only reason why we moved from fritters forest.

105
00:15:45,64 --> 00:15:52,81
So we moved to Kerry OK we moved into this house. It wasn't like this when we came here.

106
00:15:53,35 --> 00:15:59,08
There wasn't a tree in the front. We used to sit up the front on the wall and have afternoon tea.

107
00:15:59,36 --> 00:16:09,83
And if a car went by You'd have a look to see. Goodness me there is a camera. Absolutely absolutely. But I want to.

108
00:16:09,99 --> 00:16:14,67
Back to the house of trenches forest. It was a house that.

109
00:16:15,68 --> 00:16:21,9
Had some magnificent of its New Year's Eve night we would have as many as fifty sixty people

110
00:16:22,91 --> 00:16:27,45
and there were people from the new theater. And there were people from.

111
00:16:27,47 --> 00:16:37,1
The Labor party the Communist Party from the Hubert society from from the back talk.

112
00:16:37,12 --> 00:16:41,64
One night they we had four different families by the name of Moore.

113
00:16:43,24 --> 00:16:51,38
And people were satisfied with such simple things like I would do the preparation.

114
00:16:52,55 --> 00:16:58,22
Some people might come with a bottle and some may not but the emphasis was never on the ground

115
00:16:58,22 --> 00:17:05,48
and the food the emphasis was on. Singing. And companionship.

116
00:17:05,5 --> 00:17:14,09
And they were marvelous parties and that would not only be night we'd probably throw.

117
00:17:14,83 --> 00:17:20,89
Here big party that the what many many people came to their house for dinner.

118
00:17:21,11 --> 00:17:32,97
One of our favorite guests was Gordon Batten. Who created. I picked the big carrying business and at that time.

119
00:17:32,98 --> 00:17:42,28
Gordon was a millionaire living in Castle. I was very friendly with his wife who had a brain.

120
00:17:42,3 --> 00:17:45,33
And the Golden came off and for dinner.

121
00:17:46,79 --> 00:17:51,12
And there's days like you'd have a bottle of wine for a dinner party of eight

122
00:17:51,83 --> 00:17:57,1
and everyone would just have a small glass of wine and that was it and the conversation would flow.

123
00:17:57,19 --> 00:18:02,95
It was just wonderful. And I want to cation your C.

124
00:18:02,95 --> 00:18:05,26
Street was a bit turned off

125
00:18:05,26 --> 00:18:09,8
when I told her we were going to live a different stars because Hooper so easy for her to hop.

126
00:18:09,99 --> 00:18:15,13
You know Sydney and cook up some plants but friendships apart first was another kettle of fish.

127
00:18:15,33 --> 00:18:21,1
So I thought I'd better invite her actually you know one said yes he can bring four of your favorite people.

128
00:18:21,28 --> 00:18:32,71
And he was this famous I have with four main. And I continue so hard for that dinner party.

129
00:18:33,06 --> 00:18:43,77
And I had a good butcher who sold me. Well I'm a new curtains for the dining room. All yellow.

130
00:18:43,78 --> 00:18:53,26
And I had yellow Dafoe deal looked beautiful and the dining room you could look through the window

131
00:18:53,26 --> 00:19:11,57
and see the lighthouse at Brooklyn really seduce Iraq. And a couple of other hangers on.

132
00:19:17,41 --> 00:19:27,18
But this woman with a golden spoon. Walked into the dining room looked around and.

133
00:19:27,2 --> 00:19:36,71
Goodness may now all of this does look beautiful and are said Oh why did she looked at me

134
00:19:36,71 --> 00:19:45,9
but you're not supposed to be eating that. And we were living off from Constable.

135
00:19:46,21 --> 00:19:48,05
We had to make things straight

136
00:19:49,14 --> 00:19:59,1
and took it for granted there should be servants there doing that you should be out you know speaking public speaking.

137
00:19:59,28 --> 00:20:03,13
Absolutely. You know that's what you should be doing at all.

138
00:20:04,69 --> 00:20:18,8
Then she said a story about She'd put off until the beauty of. Stories of. Years growing up but. Upside of crafters.

139
00:20:22,89 --> 00:20:30,75
Forgotten and that doesn't matter. And she said how well she got on with the head groom.

140
00:20:31,05 --> 00:20:36,44
And he selected the best horse for her. And she said that's what it's about.

141
00:20:37,01 --> 00:20:43,51
You've always got to make sure you have to best horse. If you want a good job and knew I was good.

142
00:20:44,51 --> 00:20:50,44
Now I know that you shouldn't be in the kitchen. Preparing a dining room for us.

143
00:20:50,72 --> 00:21:03,06
Well I'd cook to feel a huge dinner and so forth. Anyhow. So that house carried wonderful stories.

144
00:21:04,52 --> 00:21:06,88
And people would never leave before midnight

145
00:21:07,77 --> 00:21:16,38
and very often House would pick people up as far as Bond in a hard drive them in the early hours of the morning.

146
00:21:17,66 --> 00:21:29,84
If they were interesting people. And I was just thinking the principle of. What is a school of.

147
00:21:31,61 --> 00:21:43,57
Eversley at present is the wife of a man who. During the sixties and he often came to our place.

148
00:21:45,32 --> 00:21:50,87
When we were organizing against the war in Viet Nam very often our place would be the meeting place

149
00:21:50,87 --> 00:21:58,68
and then people would hop in a cast and go down to the beach fronts for meeting. What have you. But it was.

150
00:22:01,2 --> 00:22:12,17
On one occasion. They came to our place. Three Japanese man one. I was in the parliament.

151
00:22:12,35 --> 00:22:19,37
The Japanese parliament and they were out here on a mission for peace. And I've got some photographs of them.
