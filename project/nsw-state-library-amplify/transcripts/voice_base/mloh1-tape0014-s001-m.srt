1
00:00:01,88 --> 00:00:05,86
This is mr. Ivan stenson who worked
on the bridge as a young man as

2
00:00:05,86 --> 00:00:11,68
a boy do you remember those times i went
to do it was. Around nine hundred twenty

3
00:00:11,68 --> 00:00:16,90
seven. It was about the same time as the
duke and duchess of york came out here. It

4
00:00:16,90 --> 00:00:22,75
was soon after that that i applied to work
on the harbour bridge and i was able to

5
00:00:23,86 --> 00:00:26,99
join the people there and. I started as

6
00:00:26,99 --> 00:00:33,91
a rivet heater. And. That sort

7
00:00:33,92 --> 00:00:40,65
of stuck with me for six months or more
and. Then i graduated from that onto

8
00:00:41,40 --> 00:00:47,94
catching the rivets. And
with the with the tongs i

9
00:00:47,94 --> 00:00:50,01
think that i could throw still throw

10
00:00:50,01 --> 00:00:55,86
a rivet as far as the anybody else at
the moment out and. We used to have

11
00:00:57,64 --> 00:01:02,07
to say i think between us to see just how
far we could throw rivet and you could

12
00:01:02,07 --> 00:01:06,10
see these rivets hurling through the air
and catch of the other end or that i'll

13
00:01:06,10 --> 00:01:09,45
forego and kerosene it in with the wouldn't
you know. So it wouldn't go right to

14
00:01:09,45 --> 00:01:13,45
the ten catching it plucking it out with
these tongs putting in the rivet hole

15
00:01:13,45 --> 00:01:20,03
ready for the hole. Up to put his dolly on
it and the. Well i make it into rivet it

16
00:01:20,03 --> 00:01:26,87
down. The. Had various size rivets in in

17
00:01:26,87 --> 00:01:32,97
thickness from about five eight up to him
out into three eight. And the smaller of

18
00:01:32,97 --> 00:01:38,54
its of course was for the latticework on
the the foot walk you might notice they

19
00:01:38,54 --> 00:01:38,64
have

20
00:01:38,64 --> 00:01:45,65
a latticework on the railings of the
foot works and the. And of the main

21
00:01:45,66 --> 00:01:51,54
roadway. And then the big rivets of course
were used in the bottom chords of the

22
00:01:51,54 --> 00:01:58,44
harbour bridge which go from one skew
back across to the other. Later on i from

23
00:01:58,44 --> 00:02:04,48
the. Han river thing i
was transferred over to

24
00:02:04,48 --> 00:02:09,58
a gantry which is a. Sort of

25
00:02:09,58 --> 00:02:11,30
a mobile. Crane on

26
00:02:12,61 --> 00:02:19,59
a wheel on the ground and will up on the
rail of the the wall of the workshop

27
00:02:20,45 --> 00:02:22,01
which has been like

28
00:02:22,01 --> 00:02:27,64
a gigantic horseshoe. And they all the
various ones that some operated these

29
00:02:27,64 --> 00:02:33,24
riveting machines were operated by others
were operated by hydraulic. Water over

30
00:02:33,24 --> 00:02:38,07
the water was up to about a
thousand pounds and if you had

31
00:02:38,07 --> 00:02:40,67
a nine inch ram and i gave
you. Nine times out of about

32
00:02:40,67 --> 00:02:44,75
a twelve inch ram and goes you talk times
that pressure which they use the big one

33
00:02:44,75 --> 00:02:47,92
for the the rivets which were inch and

34
00:02:47,92 --> 00:02:54,61
a quarter inch and three eight up to fourteen
inches long. And after they were put

35
00:02:54,61 --> 00:02:59,58
in you had to go back over your work. You
had to remove all the bolts that that

36
00:02:59,58 --> 00:03:04,70
were in there holding the plates together
and knock out the drips. Then go back and

37
00:03:04,70 --> 00:03:10,50
fill those holes up after the. The
rivets it killed our own there had

38
00:03:10,50 --> 00:03:15,19
a rivet inspector come along. He was imply
buoyed by the government and he just tap

39
00:03:15,19 --> 00:03:20,51
all that if it's one way. Holy swing against
their the rivet tap it if it was loose

40
00:03:20,51 --> 00:03:20,83
he put

41
00:03:20,83 --> 00:03:24,85
a cross on it. They'd have to come out. And
be they'd have to cross cut the head of

42
00:03:24,85 --> 00:03:31,45
the rivet and then drive it out. And
then you would have it was put in. The

43
00:03:34,03 --> 00:03:39,29
. These sometimes the on the revving on
the gantries the the boys or some of the

44
00:03:39,29 --> 00:03:43,18
fellows used to have jokes on the other
four fellows working around there for

45
00:03:43,18 --> 00:03:46,01
a chap came in the wintertime with the
code on you know you hang it up on the

46
00:03:46,01 --> 00:03:49,09
gantry. And they'd put

47
00:03:49,09 --> 00:03:55,74
a. Big bolt and flat big flat why should
which is just scrap steel which would be

48
00:03:55,74 --> 00:03:59,46
about three inches in diameter.
And then tied up with

49
00:03:59,46 --> 00:04:02,69
a spanner about three
foot long and then bird

50
00:04:02,69 --> 00:04:08,15
a thread over so that you were spent some
time when the knock off was went well in

51
00:04:08,15 --> 00:04:14,17
those days the bag that you used for carrying
you know gear in your lunch and that

52
00:04:14,17 --> 00:04:16,57
sort of thing was a gladstone
bag a lot no doubt

53
00:04:16,57 --> 00:04:17,43
a lot of you people might remember

54
00:04:17,43 --> 00:04:22,70
a gradstein being around but the half dozen
isn't that doesn't it. Yes said and.

55
00:04:24,39 --> 00:04:28,49
Used to leave that on the machine of course
and if you always somebody fill it up

56
00:04:28,49 --> 00:04:29,49
with with

57
00:04:29,49 --> 00:04:33,14
a flat washers and bolts and that sort of
thing in nearly put your arm out when you

58
00:04:33,14 --> 00:04:34,06
guessed it. Grab it is

59
00:04:34,06 --> 00:04:39,02
a go but. In my day. Also they used the
world your boots to the plate for me leave

60
00:04:39,02 --> 00:04:45,86
them. Or nailed your shoes to the floor
and. From that position there where i was

61
00:04:46,71 --> 00:04:50,59
sitting on the gantry i used to see various
things around the place and i remember

62
00:04:50,59 --> 00:04:52,58
one day. Chip i am

63
00:04:52,58 --> 00:04:58,59
a christmas who was only or about twenty
or thirty peter way for me. And he had

64
00:04:58,59 --> 00:05:04,63
a bit of angle iron about or nine
inches by nine inches in about

65
00:05:05,64 --> 00:05:10,74
eight feet long. When he was grinding the
end of it and he let it chatter. And with

66
00:05:10,74 --> 00:05:15,19
a grinding wheel of about twelve inches
diameter. It doesn't do that any good and

67
00:05:15,19 --> 00:05:20,68
just burst him straight in the
stomach. Which to you came a bit of

68
00:05:20,68 --> 00:05:21,28
a tummy ache for

69
00:05:21,28 --> 00:05:28,16
a few weeks and put him in hospital. And
right alongside me on the other side

70
00:05:29,03 --> 00:05:29,15
was

71
00:05:29,15 --> 00:05:36,10
a small rail which they used to push the

72
00:05:36,10 --> 00:05:41,62
completed work on little trolleys on these
rails from the light shop to the heavy

73
00:05:41,62 --> 00:05:45,05
shop and that was curved. And there was

74
00:05:45,05 --> 00:05:51,96
a stack of of steel plates.
Up to about inch in

75
00:05:51,96 --> 00:05:58,82
thickness and about six inches six
feet wide and twenty feet long and as

76
00:05:58,82 --> 00:06:02,39
they were pushing this you one day about
thirty or forty fellas pushing these

77
00:06:02,39 --> 00:06:08,03
finish girder through the filler didn't
take into account that the curve would

78
00:06:09,13 --> 00:06:12,95
squeeze him against these plates which it
didn't and it nearly tore his shoulder or

79
00:06:14,12 --> 00:06:20,96
. And nothing happened.
The big. Cleats that they

80
00:06:20,96 --> 00:06:25,64
used to lift the girders with need be twelve
inches by twelve inches and they have

81
00:06:25,64 --> 00:06:30,29
a great big. Turnbuckle with

82
00:06:30,29 --> 00:06:34,75
a crane to pick them up and attempted
just undoing this thing on the side not

83
00:06:34,75 --> 00:06:38,67
thinking what are you doing. For the last
bowled out and the thing fell straight

84
00:06:38,67 --> 00:06:44,75
down of his ankle was just about to keys
put off. But those were the nasty things

85
00:06:44,75 --> 00:06:50,12
that i knew that did happen. And
some of the humorous things. The was

86
00:06:50,12 --> 00:06:54,06
a. One of the boilermakers used to have

87
00:06:54,06 --> 00:07:00,96
a wall. I that is when i point. Upwards i
want points downward sort of thing and in

88
00:07:00,96 --> 00:07:03,57
opposite directions. And i used to have

89
00:07:03,57 --> 00:07:06,19
a watch which i used to
keep in his vest pocket

90
00:07:06,19 --> 00:07:11,25
a young fellow used to go up and ask him
the time. And he used to pull the pocket

91
00:07:11,25 --> 00:07:15,25
hour but his pulley watch out with his
right hand look up on the end get tell you

92
00:07:15,25 --> 00:07:17,43
the time. The kids
thought this was a great

93
00:07:17,43 --> 00:07:24,13
a year you know. There's various
other little things that

94
00:07:24,13 --> 00:07:29,42
that used to happen. One christmas
time there. The the raffle

95
00:07:29,42 --> 00:07:36,16
a lot of chooks and in the light shop before
the they were making up the plates to

96
00:07:36,16 --> 00:07:41,21
be made into girders they had

97
00:07:41,21 --> 00:07:46,90
a guillotine. With two fly wheels which
would be about nine feet and i am it on

98
00:07:46,90 --> 00:07:53,61
either end and they shout about.
Nine inches connecting the two. And

99
00:07:54,71 --> 00:08:00,67
they used to put these plates of about.
Inch and up to i think there were about

100
00:08:00,67 --> 00:08:07,39
into one half in there and they'd
be about ten feet wide. And by

101
00:08:07,39 --> 00:08:14,01
standing on the the lever in the
disengaged of the the guillotine. And

102
00:08:15,44 --> 00:08:19,37
i'm still there. You could hear the
guillotine engage it when you're at manly and

103
00:08:19,37 --> 00:08:23,08
how far away and it is take three quarters
of an hour for the wheels to the play

104
00:08:23,08 --> 00:08:26,02
was to run down. And some
of the boys were feeling

105
00:08:26,02 --> 00:08:30,49
a bit mary and they won the chooks and they
were trying to decapitate the chooks on

106
00:08:30,49 --> 00:08:37,33
these. But they were took smiling
all round the lights up on that day

107
00:08:39,37 --> 00:08:46,03
. But. There were some very
interesting characters down there.

108
00:08:46,09 --> 00:08:52,96
Here's one chap one particular. Englishman
i suppose i shouldn't call him promise

109
00:08:52,96 --> 00:08:55,98
to grow as we might hear me. Oh well
i'm a farm. If not you can call me

110
00:08:55,98 --> 00:09:01,64
a. He used to when he used to go to work
in the morning is to have two tins of

111
00:09:01,64 --> 00:09:07,60
tobacco he was in those age it was mostly
roll your own. One was empty and one had

112
00:09:07,60 --> 00:09:11,58
tobacco and he used to toss up heads for
the empty one tales for the one with

113
00:09:11,58 --> 00:09:16,33
tobacco in. And if he got the empty
one. He'd be humming cigarettes all

114
00:09:18,80 --> 00:09:23,85
. The other thing about them
too that you noticed after

115
00:09:23,85 --> 00:09:27,71
a while. They'd be out here for about
twelve or eighteen months and they'd be

116
00:09:27,71 --> 00:09:33,72
getting complaining about how cold it was
here. So they go home to england. twelve

117
00:09:33,73 --> 00:09:39,18
months they be back and they said do
you bloody cold over there. Now the

118
00:09:40,20 --> 00:09:46,89
population of on the harbour bridge
in the workshops where i was scotch

119
00:09:46,90 --> 00:09:53,60
irish and english. And
here along in amongst the

120
00:09:53,60 --> 00:09:57,51
irish there was some pretty wild characters
i can tell you feel as if forward in

121
00:09:57,51 --> 00:10:03,45
the black and down wall. And i just can't
think of the name of the couple of these

122
00:10:03,45 --> 00:10:05,08
fellows but i'm just going back

123
00:10:05,08 --> 00:10:07,33
a few years though it's hard
to remember names and there's

124
00:10:07,33 --> 00:10:13,31
a few names i do remember. And. The

125
00:10:15,24 --> 00:10:22,06
. One of the holder ups or the more or less
you know i suppose in modern days you'd

126
00:10:22,06 --> 00:10:22,34
call him

127
00:10:22,34 --> 00:10:27,86
a tradesman assistant was at an italian
by the name of joe. Tara or his full name

128
00:10:27,86 --> 00:10:33,11
was joe gondar tara. And he was one of the
strongest men i've seen i've seen him

129
00:10:33,11 --> 00:10:37,33
lift weights that you know two men and be
staggering and in the book with this big

130
00:10:37,33 --> 00:10:44,27
weight. And. The. How much that they

131
00:10:44,27 --> 00:10:48,36
use down there were from seven fourteen
twenty eight and fifty six pound hammers

132
00:10:48,36 --> 00:10:50,30
and he swing a fifty six
pound hammers if it was

133
00:10:50,30 --> 00:10:54,100
a fourteen pound however. He
was truly a strong man and

134
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,67
a very nice person with it. He was

135
00:10:58,46 --> 00:11:02,53
a thorough gentleman in every respect. And
i did learn later after he finished on

136
00:11:02,53 --> 00:11:04,69
the harbour bridge he went back
to his old trade which was

137
00:11:04,69 --> 00:11:10,73
a gunsmith. He had that shop out at newtown.
I never did catch up with him again i

138
00:11:10,73 --> 00:11:16,35
would have liked to. But.
As you know. Things.

139
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,14
People got

140
00:11:18,14 --> 00:11:24,44
a bit scattered after the. The finish
of work on the harbour bridge and

141
00:11:26,43 --> 00:11:31,50
the great depression was on then and the
people lot of the people who worked on the

142
00:11:31,50 --> 00:11:33,28
harbour bridge went up to
new guinea because he was

143
00:11:33,28 --> 00:11:37,32
a big project going up there now particularly
for the boilermakers that at that

144
00:11:37,32 --> 00:11:43,75
time they were going up there to work.
It dave over and went up there amongst

145
00:11:43,75 --> 00:11:47,08
others. Yes he did too. Its main
effect. I was only looking at

146
00:11:47,08 --> 00:11:53,20
a photo of dave the other this morning.
In the some of the pictures that have got

147
00:11:53,20 --> 00:11:58,18
of the harbour bridge and you know he
looked about thirty of them. And he's irish

148
00:11:58,18 --> 00:12:00,45
how do you know i have

149
00:12:00,46 --> 00:12:06,63
a crown on it. And. The

150
00:12:08,35 --> 00:12:11,08
. And just blanked out for

151
00:12:11,08 --> 00:12:15,65
a moment. Does matter. Do you remember what
happened to you when you were laid off

152
00:12:15,65 --> 00:12:21,77
or what but what year. What time of the
year was soon after the arch was locked.

153
00:12:21,88 --> 00:12:28,70
That was in no i'm sorry.
That's how it was in thirty one

154
00:12:28,70 --> 00:12:35,17
that i finished there. Around about much
thirty one. So where were you when the

155
00:12:35,17 --> 00:12:39,59
whole bridge was opened. I was in sydney i
was living at chatswood at the time and

156
00:12:39,59 --> 00:12:44,67
. When it was open. Because
like everybody else went for

157
00:12:44,67 --> 00:12:50,67
a walk across the bridge on the opening
night. Now thousands of people just walking

158
00:12:50,67 --> 00:12:51,05
across

159
00:12:51,05 --> 00:12:58,19
a bridge the.

160
00:12:58,21 --> 00:13:03,78
I've just run out of words. I mean.
What about did you did you go to get

161
00:13:03,78 --> 00:13:09,10
a job after the whole bridge and they were
very few and far between. You'd get in

162
00:13:09,10 --> 00:13:10,66
a queue. You know

163
00:13:10,66 --> 00:13:16,35
a couple of hundred yards long and by the
time you got there. They were very very

164
00:13:16,35 --> 00:13:19,44
selective what's experience to be
had having had an experience where

165
00:13:19,44 --> 00:13:24,63
a lot of things you didn't have experience
in those days because you know more is

166
00:13:24,63 --> 00:13:26,05
fresh out of school and going to

167
00:13:26,05 --> 00:13:32,04
a job like out and for any thing outside
and what you were doing. Well you didn't

168
00:13:32,04 --> 00:13:37,58
have the experience for and they were very
very selective. You said do all sorts of

169
00:13:37,58 --> 00:13:44,51
odd jobs around the place and
gradually i was able to you know keep

170
00:13:44,51 --> 00:13:51,37
myself occupied. And one of the things
that i did notice about which i think

171
00:13:51,37 --> 00:13:51,85
that they're

172
00:13:51,85 --> 00:13:58,56
a lot of the unions and poor people
they could follow was i can only recall

173
00:13:58,56 --> 00:14:03,38
one day that we had a
strike or it is not so much

174
00:14:03,38 --> 00:14:04,31
a strike. It was

175
00:14:05,72 --> 00:14:11,39
a twenty four hour. Stoppage. There was

176
00:14:11,39 --> 00:14:18,36
a case in the united states that two
italians by when sacco and vanzetti

177
00:14:20,05 --> 00:14:23,76
. They were going to be executed on

178
00:14:23,76 --> 00:14:27,11
a particular day. For

179
00:14:27,12 --> 00:14:34,04
a crime that it supposed to be in committed.
About seven years before. And the

180
00:14:34,04 --> 00:14:36,45
evidence that convicted them
was somebody saw them in

181
00:14:36,45 --> 00:14:41,84
a car passing at sixty mile an hour eighty
years ago for. That was even though

182
00:14:41,84 --> 00:14:47,81
there were. They were convicted on and
executed. So i think it was worldwide that

183
00:14:47,81 --> 00:14:51,45
they had the twenty four hour stoppage.
And that was the only thing i can recall

184
00:14:52,32 --> 00:14:56,35
sure we used to have a union meetings
and things like that. But there was

185
00:14:56,35 --> 00:15:02,37
a lot more tolerance still to what
you were doing in those days and.

186
00:15:03,25 --> 00:15:07,60
You were known worker won't you in the
ironworkers union at the time. Do you

187
00:15:07,60 --> 00:15:12,72
remember the union meetings in that year
i remember those and they weren't as

188
00:15:12,72 --> 00:15:18,03
numerous as they do know you don't have to
drop you had to cool meeting whom. Like

189
00:15:18,03 --> 00:15:23,86
they do now but they were few
and far more tween. And.

190
00:15:25,41 --> 00:15:28,91
They used to help them outside on the
wharf where the bought the stuff in from

191
00:15:28,91 --> 00:15:35,85
england from don and
long. The winters were

192
00:15:35,85 --> 00:15:42,56
very very cool there because there
was no virtually no sides to the

193
00:15:42,56 --> 00:15:49,40
workshops and used to have to get all the
breezes on the particular disabilities

194
00:15:49,40 --> 00:15:53,57
coming off them where the heavy shop is now
it's course where the luna park is and

195
00:15:53,57 --> 00:16:00,51
where the. Olympic pool is. For the
people who who you know might want to

196
00:16:00,51 --> 00:16:06,22
know where the workshops where. And one
works up there were not in straight line

197
00:16:06,22 --> 00:16:11,54
with each other but as i explained before
there they were about. I suppose fifteen

198
00:16:11,54 --> 00:16:17,72
degrees difference between the two of
them in the in the angle. And that on the

199
00:16:17,72 --> 00:16:24,31
lower exit to the the light workshop was
then milton's point station and muslims

200
00:16:24,31 --> 00:16:28,53
point ferry terminal. That's where the
ferries used to come and everybody used to

201
00:16:28,53 --> 00:16:33,18
get off there and get onto the train to
walk up there with the latest to the tram

202
00:16:33,18 --> 00:16:39,99
as which used to run then. Do you
remember the when they moved

203
00:16:40,78 --> 00:16:43,42
there when they moved the railway station
from the end of millicent's point to

204
00:16:43,42 --> 00:16:49,45
build the workshops. I remember the first
of all the railway station the original

205
00:16:49,45 --> 00:16:54,35
rail was tatian finished.
Always at where the northern

206
00:16:56,33 --> 00:17:02,67
ireland is now and then they moved it
around to where half way round till eleven

207
00:17:02,67 --> 00:17:09,59
obey there and. Of course the railway
line is still there which they use

208
00:17:09,59 --> 00:17:14,84
for the. For the trains for hunting and
that sort of thing from those in the and

209
00:17:14,84 --> 00:17:21,61
wave at them. Yes i have seen pictures
of course but i was only only just born

210
00:17:21,61 --> 00:17:26,03
then that i used to get

211
00:17:26,03 --> 00:17:30,99
a lot of news in that into the workshop
because i did mostly night shift there and

212
00:17:30,99 --> 00:17:35,19
people coming in it. Tell you on the news
of the day and when they people were

213
00:17:35,19 --> 00:17:37,86
coming in very very gloomily.
Because there had been

214
00:17:37,86 --> 00:17:43,98
a very very bad for reaction of the
great cliff. That's when the heat.

215
00:17:45,24 --> 00:17:49,94
Rolled over and sank it. And then
you see at the news of the smart

216
00:17:49,94 --> 00:17:55,06
a cup trophies and things like catching
people coming in. Give you the news. Of the

217
00:17:55,06 --> 00:17:59,78
time you got how many eleven o'clock or
how past eleven. You'll be getting out of

218
00:17:59,78 --> 00:18:04,67
the place thing you go want to sleep cause
your social activities were restricted

219
00:18:04,67 --> 00:18:09,71
more or less two weekends and. There were

220
00:18:12,63 --> 00:18:19,29
a number of. Rollovers worked with each
other down there was my brother he was

221
00:18:19,29 --> 00:18:24,48
there for some time. Then there with. Some
irish lad by the name of thompson there

222
00:18:24,48 --> 00:18:26,10
was dave and joe thomas and then there was

223
00:18:26,10 --> 00:18:32,55
a string for as the father and the two
sons horry and jim strength alone and

224
00:18:33,45 --> 00:18:35,05
in some cases it was also

225
00:18:35,05 --> 00:18:40,36
a family affair. Did you did you go out
together and sometimes when you were off

226
00:18:40,36 --> 00:18:45,21
duty. Oh yes yes we used the particular
string fellows and then the baby thomas and

227
00:18:45,98 --> 00:18:48,88
navy thompson and i
used to go to the royal

228
00:18:48,89 --> 00:18:52,99
a lot in those days of dancing and you
know we channel the cockies where probably

229
00:18:52,99 --> 00:18:58,49
people remember the various legs that were
around then different sides but that was

230
00:18:58,49 --> 00:19:02,56
it how meeting place under the cockies. And
we used to go to the beach and you know

231
00:19:02,56 --> 00:19:08,15
the various days you ax around on the beach
and that sort of thing when the chap

232
00:19:08,15 --> 00:19:12,81
selling there was he was very good at that
and you know you used to swing him over

233
00:19:12,81 --> 00:19:18,36
your head and all sorts of
things. But it was. It was

234
00:19:19,72 --> 00:19:21,38
really happy days. I suppose in

235
00:19:21,38 --> 00:19:27,07
a lot of respects because that's before you
start to have to really settle down and

236
00:19:27,07 --> 00:19:34,05
care about. The greater things in
life. He was single then. Yes i

237
00:19:34,05 --> 00:19:37,15
was seeing your years and what age were
you when you started and finished on the

238
00:19:37,15 --> 00:19:43,65
harbour bridge. I was. I
suppose i could be fifteen

239
00:19:46,07 --> 00:19:52,86
fifteen the half and i finished when i
was eighteen. In my teens and i find

240
00:19:54,44 --> 00:19:55,04
i was there three and

241
00:19:55,04 --> 00:19:59,32
a half years in him. Where did you live.
How did you get to work. I used to catch

242
00:19:59,32 --> 00:20:04,94
the train from chatswood down to. Two
muslims points straight off the train into

243
00:20:04,94 --> 00:20:11,81
the into work and. Then if i had to go

244
00:20:11,81 --> 00:20:16,06
to town like saturday night he makes to
have to make sure that i was home or down

245
00:20:16,06 --> 00:20:23,02
to the key to get the last ferry across
and get the train. From there but i have

246
00:20:23,02 --> 00:20:28,49
missed the last train at times and had to
walk from mrs freud to chatswood that.

247
00:20:29,16 --> 00:20:33,27
You didn't seem to mind. I still like
walking as a matter fact i do we used to do

248
00:20:33,27 --> 00:20:38,49
a lot of walking in the latter years in
the when i was in and other capacity. I

249
00:20:38,49 --> 00:20:39,90
used to walk about a mile and

250
00:20:39,90 --> 00:20:44,84
a half every lunch hour. Do you remember
the extracurricular activities in the

251
00:20:44,84 --> 00:20:49,40
workshops during the lunch hour. Well you
didn't get to change him. I suppose that

252
00:20:49,40 --> 00:20:54,94
sit down where they were working and need
put out their lunch and some of them have

253
00:20:54,94 --> 00:21:00,03
the thermos bag the thermos bottles and
others just boil the billy in there. They

254
00:21:00,03 --> 00:21:04,91
have their town by the time that was oh
you're back to working in. There was there

255
00:21:04,91 --> 00:21:09,19
wasn't too much time because it was only
what half an hour or something like and no

256
00:21:09,19 --> 00:21:16,13
crown and anchor or anything like. I
didn't. Really. There was some games play

257
00:21:16,13 --> 00:21:21,57
but there was i never took part in them.
I thought all. Several people told me

258
00:21:21,57 --> 00:21:23,41
these to get and the
boys used to go down for

259
00:21:23,41 --> 00:21:28,51
a swim in the neutral bay bar. They
probably did but it was really they have to

260
00:21:28,51 --> 00:21:33,19
walk around the train lines to do that. And
one of them swore he used to go and be

261
00:21:34,01 --> 00:21:39,07
right. Love and obey you. Right. But one
of them swore that he used to dive in the

262
00:21:39,07 --> 00:21:43,10
harbor as well although dave evans that
he saw sharks in there. Well that's right

263
00:21:43,10 --> 00:21:47,50
there are a lot of other things used
to see floating around. Which don't be

264
00:21:47,50 --> 00:21:54,45
a mentioning over and over
the air at all. Do you

265
00:21:54,45 --> 00:22:00,47
when you were laid off. We never on the
dole. I was too young to go on the dole at

266
00:22:00,47 --> 00:22:05,15
that stage. So i wanted to
do. I used to go around it

267
00:22:05,15 --> 00:22:06,83
a little bit of gardening
doing a little bit of there's

268
00:22:06,83 --> 00:22:11,70
a little bit of that you know
anything i could do to earn

269
00:22:11,70 --> 00:22:16,84
a few shillings at that time and go around
neighbors and that sort of thing you

270
00:22:16,84 --> 00:22:22,92
want some gardening done or anything.
I've jobs jobs done. You live with your

271
00:22:22,92 --> 00:22:28,95
parents to do so i did. Yes and your father
did was he working. He was. Yes he was

272
00:22:28,95 --> 00:22:32,57
working in fact my father's brothers living
with us all the time and he was on the

273
00:22:32,57 --> 00:22:38,24
dole and he was he worked on the. You know

274
00:22:39,67 --> 00:22:45,86
that. Eastern valley highway. As you know
the eastern valley highway was built by

275
00:22:46,59 --> 00:22:51,72
workers and also the epping road it was
built by workers and celente it's park

276
00:22:51,72 --> 00:22:54,68
outside royal north shore hospital
or this and i was able at royal as

277
00:22:54,68 --> 00:23:00,30
a hospital that was built by die workers
to get they get paid. They had to do so

278
00:23:00,30 --> 00:23:07,06
much work to get get their.
Ration tickets. It was there.

279
00:23:07,31 --> 00:23:13,44
That's where it's wrong today and it was
that was done in the two two weeks of work

280
00:23:13,44 --> 00:23:16,68
and five weeks off your
countrymen. I don't remember now.

281
00:23:20,25 --> 00:23:21,71
Yes others. There was quite

282
00:23:21,71 --> 00:23:25,64
a few different systems they had i run the
place that some of the felons have told

283
00:23:25,64 --> 00:23:32,45
me about. Well i never was on the dog.
I wasn't eligible to retire. But i

284
00:23:32,45 --> 00:23:39,37
tried but i wasn't eligible.
Looking back now what do you

285
00:23:39,37 --> 00:23:45,33
think of those days on the bridge. Well
they were good days and i enjoyed the

286
00:23:45,33 --> 00:23:48,41
working there and. I learned

287
00:23:48,41 --> 00:23:54,11
a few skills now and there and which i
think. Abstract i mean. You learn learn

288
00:23:54,11 --> 00:23:58,08
a lot from from the attitude of the people
who are working with because if you

289
00:23:58,08 --> 00:24:02,70
didn't do your job you soon. Knew about
it's new it's not like today where you can

290
00:24:02,70 --> 00:24:03,23
get away with

291
00:24:03,23 --> 00:24:06,02
a lot of things that you could never
get away with in those days it was

292
00:24:06,96 --> 00:24:09,88
a good swift kick in the backside as something
like that. If you didn't do your job

293
00:24:11,01 --> 00:24:15,62
. I'd be right if that happened
there. There would certainly would be

294
00:24:15,62 --> 00:24:22,49
a right now. Do you remember the working
conditions around the workshop for then.

295
00:24:22,63 --> 00:24:28,96
Well in the working conditions in those
they were primitive to working conditions

296
00:24:28,96 --> 00:24:34,31
in these days even the men in jails have
better conditions. I would say than the

297
00:24:34,31 --> 00:24:40,75
work conditions in those days for us if
you want to go to the toilet the toilet.

298
00:24:40,77 --> 00:24:41,22
There was

299
00:24:41,22 --> 00:24:48,07
a block of toilets which we had about
eight or nine rows of toilets on either

300
00:24:48,07 --> 00:24:53,39
side back to back and they had
no doors on them. And they

301
00:24:55,01 --> 00:25:01,23
surround of it was only about six or seven
feet high. So that you got all the cold

302
00:25:01,23 --> 00:25:05,62
breeze well for harboring it into there
and. The foreman used to walk around

303
00:25:05,62 --> 00:25:09,40
occasionally have a look around see if
you been in there too long or if you got

304
00:25:09,40 --> 00:25:10,11
a new got

305
00:25:10,11 --> 00:25:13,71
a paper and if you thought you'd been there
too long. It used to make you stand up

306
00:25:13,71 --> 00:25:20,58
and able to go down the aisle. So
you had to be very careful of your

307
00:25:20,59 --> 00:25:27,37
behaviour which you. In those in
that respect and they didn't take

308
00:25:27,37 --> 00:25:32,22
to tolerate to you any clowning around
which is it's a good thing because.
