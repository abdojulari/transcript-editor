1
00:00:07,20 --> 00:00:17,51
I've never seen it before.

2
00:00:17,53 --> 00:00:19,34
So.

3
00:00:20,41 --> 00:00:24,59
This.

4
00:00:24,60 --> 00:00:27,47
Was pure care.

5
00:00:27,49 --> 00:00:34,54
I'm jenny dell i lived at
nimbin for 11 years from 1974.

6
00:00:34,56 --> 00:00:36,43
Having arrived there from england

7
00:00:37,58 --> 00:00:43,97
and had i come to australia to see if there
was any form of counterculture here at

8
00:00:43,97 --> 00:00:49,36
all. I didn't want to remain living in
england where i'd been brought up and.

9
00:00:50,62 --> 00:00:52,24
Having arrived at perth and

10
00:00:53,06 --> 00:00:56,34
and then travelled on to adelaide i
was sort of asking everywhere i went.

11
00:00:56,66 --> 00:00:59,58
If there was any alternative culture.

12
00:00:59,59 --> 00:01:01,49
Around australia and it turned out

13
00:01:01,49 --> 00:01:05,50
that it was a year after the aquarius
festival had been held it never been

14
00:01:05,50 --> 00:01:07,38
and the closer i got
to the eastern states.

15
00:01:08,48 --> 00:01:14,44
The more people were saying oh you should
check out nimbin so i arrived here

16
00:01:14,44 --> 00:01:19,02
actually on my way to the other turn table
land which i thought would be a nice

17
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:20,78
place to go and look at and i'd heard

18
00:01:20,78 --> 00:01:24,88
that also alternative lifestyle
as living up there too.

19
00:01:26,68 --> 00:01:30,82
And arrived in nimbin on a sunday
afternoon and went into the craft shop

20
00:01:30,82 --> 00:01:35,56
and asked where's the commune and
everybody fell about laughing because

21
00:01:35,56 --> 00:01:39,88
that was what everyone who arrived at
nimbin always used to ask was a commune

22
00:01:39,88 --> 00:01:46,04
and the only commune at that time
was not strictly speaking a commune

23
00:01:46,04 --> 00:01:52,79
but a co-operative that had been bought
immediately after the aquarius festival.

24
00:01:52,81 --> 00:01:57,62
And it was about at that time. Twelve
hundred acres of land in a valley.

25
00:01:58,94 --> 00:02:01,72
That had one. It's had a
sawmill at the end of it.

26
00:02:01,77 --> 00:02:06,94
So there was quite a lot of tree
loss and erosion on the land already

27
00:02:08,34 --> 00:02:14,27
but it had been sold by a
guy calls sam mackay to.

28
00:02:14,29 --> 00:02:18,68
A co-operative of i think
it was 900 shareholders.

29
00:02:18,70 --> 00:02:20,38
After the aquarius festival and

30
00:02:20,38 --> 00:02:25,40
and set up as a sort of piece
of liberated land in a way

31
00:02:25,40 --> 00:02:31,96
that was no longer on the open market but
that for $200 and a $50 joining fee.

32
00:02:33,17 --> 00:02:34,75
One could become a shareholder and

33
00:02:34,75 --> 00:02:40,24
and part of this extraordinary
experiment in land ownership

34
00:02:41,34 --> 00:02:45,86
and. I arrived there with a caravan and.

35
00:02:45,88 --> 00:02:52,32
A husband and two children and we lived
in the caravan for the first six months

36
00:02:52,32 --> 00:02:53,42
or so that we were there

37
00:02:54,41 --> 00:02:58,08
and then we're lucky enough to be able to
move into one of the very few existing

38
00:02:58,08 --> 00:02:59,75
houses on the property.

39
00:03:00,06 --> 00:03:05,52
I think there were probably four
or five old ramshackle houses

40
00:03:05,52 --> 00:03:08,90
that had been pretty much
derelict when the land was bought

41
00:03:10,32 --> 00:03:11,29
and we lived in one of those.

42
00:03:13,06 --> 00:03:18,12
And we considered ourselves very lucky
to have such a large roof over our heads

43
00:03:18,12 --> 00:03:22,23
because at that time it was very
tough a timetable falls. It was.

44
00:03:23,69 --> 00:03:27,68
The early part of 1974 there
was the worst wet season

45
00:03:27,68 --> 00:03:30,60
that people could remember for
years and years and years

46
00:03:31,82 --> 00:03:35,11
and most people who moved onto the
land were living in temporary shelters

47
00:03:35,11 --> 00:03:36,82
or caravans or tents

48
00:03:36,82 --> 00:03:40,41
or whatever they could sort of scrape
together to keep the rain off them

49
00:03:41,62 --> 00:03:47,17
and basically survival was the name of
the game. Nobody had very much money.

50
00:03:47,18 --> 00:03:53,59
And so in a way we were very dependent
on each other for help and support

51
00:03:53,59 --> 00:03:59,94
and transport because only
one family in maybe four.

52
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,33
I've or six would actually have
reliable transportation and at

53
00:04:03,33 --> 00:04:08,85
that time time travel owned one big truck
which frequently used to be used to take

54
00:04:08,85 --> 00:04:13,68
everyone to a dance or a party or to
the beach at the weekend or whatever.

55
00:04:15,71 --> 00:04:20,03
Whence you came straight.

56
00:04:21,49 --> 00:04:26,51
Well i had a very precise impression
of what it was i wanted the way

57
00:04:26,51 --> 00:04:27,47
that i wanted to live

58
00:04:27,47 --> 00:04:34,08
and sitting up in the north of england
through a very cold winter in

59
00:04:34,08 --> 00:04:35,47
1973.

60
00:04:36,81 --> 00:04:42,69
I looked at world atlas is to see on many
levels where would be the best place on

61
00:04:42,69 --> 00:04:43,80
the planet for me to live

62
00:04:43,80 --> 00:04:48,14
that would be possible for me to live
because of you know immigration allowances

63
00:04:48,15 --> 00:04:48,41
and

64
00:04:48,41 --> 00:04:54,49
that sort of stuff so first i was a track
to two definitely a warm climate i wanted

65
00:04:54,49 --> 00:04:55,38
to be somewhere warm

66
00:04:55,38 --> 00:05:00,76
and i first looked at what used to be called
british honduras which is now believes

67
00:05:01,58 --> 00:05:04,30
in central america and that's a
very appealing and i looked into

68
00:05:04,30 --> 00:05:05,99
that very carefully.

69
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:11,91
And but from those investigations it
looked as if you know to live the way

70
00:05:11,91 --> 00:05:17,82
that i wanted to live would be quite
difficult there because of the sort of

71
00:05:17,82 --> 00:05:21,78
political situation in
central and south america.

72
00:05:21,79 --> 00:05:28,58
And at that time australia had a white
australia policy. It had conscription.

73
00:05:29,06 --> 00:05:30,84
And it was involved in the vietnam war.

74
00:05:32,16 --> 00:05:36,36
And all of that all of those
things were most unappealing to me

75
00:05:36,36 --> 00:05:39,43
and particularly conscription
because i had a baby son

76
00:05:41,06 --> 00:05:45,69
and so i sort of discounted a stray leo
though for an english person who wanted to

77
00:05:45,69 --> 00:05:49,67
go and live in a warm climate it was
the obvious place to choose but then.

78
00:05:50,63 --> 00:05:51,87
A lot of television

79
00:05:51,88 --> 00:05:57,34
and radio coverage was given in england
to gough whitlam's campaign for election.

80
00:05:58,34 --> 00:05:59,74
I guess that was 1970 through.

81
00:06:00,71 --> 00:06:03,16
And i watched that

82
00:06:03,16 --> 00:06:08,05
and was very interested in this guy he was
very favorably portrayed in the english

83
00:06:08,05 --> 00:06:11,96
media and when he was elected

84
00:06:11,96 --> 00:06:14,70
and announced an amnesty for draft dodgers

85
00:06:14,70 --> 00:06:17,12
and the end of the white australia policy.

86
00:06:17,64 --> 00:06:22,22
I thought that's it i'm going to australia
that that's the place i want to be

87
00:06:23,29 --> 00:06:27,82
but in terms of counterculture i didn't
know what would what would be existing here

88
00:06:27,82 --> 00:06:28,53
but i didn't know

89
00:06:29,34 --> 00:06:36,24
that i wanted to live in an area well
away from major cities where it would be

90
00:06:36,24 --> 00:06:42,64
possible to grow one's own food where i
even had a sort of pretty clear idea of the

91
00:06:42,64 --> 00:06:43,76
kind of landscape

92
00:06:43,76 --> 00:06:47,42
that i'd like to live in which was hills
with lots of fresh running water.

93
00:06:47,75 --> 00:06:50,71
Not too far from the coast.

94
00:06:51,86 --> 00:06:52,18
And

95
00:06:52,19 --> 00:06:58,42
that i would want to be living in close
proximity to a large number of like minded

96
00:06:58,42 --> 00:07:02,58
people but not necessarily in a commune

97
00:07:02,58 --> 00:07:07,56
or household as such because i'd had some
experience of community living in england

98
00:07:08,48 --> 00:07:11,96
and had found that for other
people more than for myself.

99
00:07:12,34 --> 00:07:14,39
Young children in a commune

100
00:07:14,39 --> 00:07:17,85
or household can be quite a problem because
parents have different ways of bringing

101
00:07:17,85 --> 00:07:22,14
kids up and so on and it could lead
to to friction and difficulty.

102
00:07:22,80 --> 00:07:28,70
So my vision was that i would have my
own little sort of unit with my kids

103
00:07:28,70 --> 00:07:34,06
but be very close to and co-operative
with a large group of other people

104
00:07:35,08 --> 00:07:38,92
and so it turned out that when
i arrived at nimbin exactly

105
00:07:38,92 --> 00:07:40,69
that was starting to grow there

106
00:07:41,65 --> 00:07:46,10
and it was so close to my
vision of how i wanted to live.

107
00:07:46,31 --> 00:07:50,19
I couldn't have been closer it
was exactly the sort of ideas

108
00:07:50,19 --> 00:07:57,07
that i'd had so i felt immediately
connected to the people here as

109
00:07:57,07 --> 00:08:03,52
if you know this was like a. Long
lost family or something and.

110
00:08:03,54 --> 00:08:06,69
And very quickly settled
into the living here

111
00:08:07,52 --> 00:08:13,59
and in those days really none of us
had anything you know we were all

112
00:08:14,54 --> 00:08:17,17
very poor we had no money we had no jobs.

113
00:08:18,87 --> 00:08:25,13
We were pretty dependent on government
benefits in the early days as well which.

114
00:08:26,02 --> 00:08:28,91
Is you know an aspect of of nimbin life

115
00:08:28,91 --> 00:08:32,42
that i have had many
differing positions on and

116
00:08:32,42 --> 00:08:36,15
and the one i feel now is quite different
from the one i had then i guess

117
00:08:37,27 --> 00:08:43,76
but in the early days we looked on the
dole as a form of rural subsidy where it

118
00:08:43,76 --> 00:08:49,61
allowed people like ourselves to
establish ourselves on degraded land

119
00:08:49,61 --> 00:08:50,37
and there's no doubt

120
00:08:50,37 --> 00:08:55,67
that the land was terribly
degraded by years of over grazing

121
00:08:55,67 --> 00:08:58,95
and being used as pasture in
the dairying cattle industry

122
00:09:00,52 --> 00:09:05,38
and also from being over logged
and eroded because of that so.

123
00:09:06,04 --> 00:09:13,00
We felt that we you know were there to
put something back into the land and.

124
00:09:13,02 --> 00:09:19,77
And also take the land off the endless
cycle of capitalism and property.

125
00:09:20,40 --> 00:09:23,32
As inland being being a
sort of form of currency

126
00:09:24,71 --> 00:09:28,56
that by the very act of purchasing
it cooperatively and having rules

127
00:09:28,56 --> 00:09:32,93
that said it could never be sold without
everyone's agreement we we actually to the

128
00:09:32,93 --> 00:09:36,19
land out of that situation which was.

129
00:09:36,87 --> 00:09:39,91
You know ideologically an
agreement that we all had

130
00:09:39,91 --> 00:09:44,96
and one of the very few things
that we all agreed on. And.

131
00:09:44,98 --> 00:09:51,14
I think because we were so poor that we had
to depend on each other and we had to.

132
00:09:53,07 --> 00:09:57,59
We had to live very closely together
and share an awful lot of things

133
00:09:57,59 --> 00:09:59,79
that suburban families and.

134
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,99
People you know who live sort of ordinary
lives in the outside world don't share

135
00:10:05,32 --> 00:10:09,66
and that's a very taxing
thing to do and you.

136
00:10:10,15 --> 00:10:15,66
It doesn't always not
always a smooth path and.

137
00:10:15,68 --> 00:10:20,50
I think looking back on those early years
of tundra book falls in the mid to late

138
00:10:20,50 --> 00:10:23,78
seventies the stuff

139
00:10:23,78 --> 00:10:29,81
that we learnt about living with other
people about human nature about ourselves

140
00:10:29,81 --> 00:10:35,99
about tolerance and
compassion and. Sort of.

141
00:10:37,30 --> 00:10:39,80
Looking at something from
other people's points of view

142
00:10:39,80 --> 00:10:43,93
and from many points of view.
Was it was beyond price.

143
00:10:44,16 --> 00:10:49,71
I can't imagine a better training
than than that and it seems now

144
00:10:49,71 --> 00:10:53,47
that the children who were babies
then and are now in their late teens

145
00:10:53,47 --> 00:10:58,09
and early twenties have
grown up steeped in

146
00:10:58,09 --> 00:10:59,53
that culture

147
00:11:00,54 --> 00:11:05,41
and have emerged into the
world incredibly enriched

148
00:11:05,41 --> 00:11:11,66
and i you know any comparison is odious
but i really think that that the kids

149
00:11:11,66 --> 00:11:14,42
that grew up there during
that time and surrounded by

150
00:11:14,42 --> 00:11:19,68
that kind of activity have have something
extra. You know that other kids.

151
00:11:19,72 --> 00:11:25,26
Unfortunately you know don't have
unless they've lived in in very special

152
00:11:25,26 --> 00:11:35,40
circumstances as well with things.

153
00:11:37,94 --> 00:11:41,01
Well i think i think that was one of
the reasons why it did work the fact

154
00:11:41,01 --> 00:11:43,14
that it was very hard to make rules and

155
00:11:44,85 --> 00:11:47,36
and have everybody agreeing
on the same issues.

156
00:11:47,53 --> 00:11:50,70
I think was one of the reasons why it
was possible for everyone to stay there

157
00:11:50,70 --> 00:11:55,48
because i think if there had been a
very rigid structure then it wouldn't.

158
00:11:55,71 --> 00:11:59,82
We were too individualistic and it
wouldn't have worked and people people.

159
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:01,07
Would have fought too hard

160
00:12:02,67 --> 00:12:06,21
but interestingly although i've just sort
of eulogized how wonderful the effect of

161
00:12:06,21 --> 00:12:09,65
it was on the kids that there was
things about kids there that for me.

162
00:12:09,68 --> 00:12:10,32
Didn't work

163
00:12:10,32 --> 00:12:16,28
and in fact constituted the reason why
i left tangible falls after two years.

164
00:12:16,30 --> 00:12:20,63
And that was that.

165
00:12:20,65 --> 00:12:26,05
It was very laissez faire
and anything goes with kids

166
00:12:26,05 --> 00:12:31,69
and i was a parent who although i
was choosing the counterculture

167
00:12:31,69 --> 00:12:37,02
and i was choosing you know to reduce
everywhere i could see the forms of all

168
00:12:37,02 --> 00:12:42,55
sorrow to you and dominants that i
was wanting to expel from my life.

169
00:12:44,04 --> 00:12:49,99
At the same time i i felt that to
bring children up with no boundaries

170
00:12:49,99 --> 00:12:53,77
and no limits was quite
a confusing thing to do

171
00:12:53,77 --> 00:12:58,50
and it was putting too much responsibility
on tiny children to constantly be giving

172
00:12:58,50 --> 00:13:04,10
them choices about what time they went to
bed or you know how far they could roam

173
00:13:04,10 --> 00:13:06,39
or whether they got
home before dark or not

174
00:13:06,39 --> 00:13:11,66
and i'm talking about you know children
from 18 months now up to say six years old

175
00:13:11,66 --> 00:13:15,53
because there weren't many at that time
who were older than six maybe one or two

176
00:13:15,53 --> 00:13:22,01
but not many and my children were very
small and the children ran in a pack

177
00:13:22,01 --> 00:13:27,25
and that was terrific and it was you
know there were many advantages in that

178
00:13:27,25 --> 00:13:29,50
but there were also disadvantages in

179
00:13:29,50 --> 00:13:34,61
that i felt some other parents weren't
quite as keen to take responsibility for

180
00:13:34,61 --> 00:13:40,18
their kids whereabouts and
activities as i was and i.

181
00:13:40,20 --> 00:13:43,92
I was in a very much a minority and
wanting to set limits are my kids

182
00:13:45,14 --> 00:13:47,82
and in the end.

183
00:13:47,84 --> 00:13:50,22
It happened that darkness fell

184
00:13:50,22 --> 00:13:54,45
and bonnie was an 18 months old had
been out with the kids all day

185
00:13:55,83 --> 00:14:00,46
and i didn't know where she was it had
been raining the creek. It was up.

186
00:14:00,51 --> 00:14:05,33
It was a worrying time and what a wonderful
when it's dark it's dark. No lighting.

187
00:14:05,47 --> 00:14:07,74
There's no streetlights raining.

188
00:14:07,75 --> 00:14:12,23
And i went across the creek to the family
whose children she i knew she was with

189
00:14:12,23 --> 00:14:17,16
and they were all stoned.
And i said you know.

190
00:14:17,73 --> 00:14:21,44
He hasn't come home and i'm really worried
and they all laughed and said it's cool.

191
00:14:23,13 --> 00:14:25,17
And i thought you know i've
had enough of this idea.

192
00:14:25,19 --> 00:14:26,23
I don't want to live like this.

193
00:14:26,40 --> 00:14:30,04
This is scary and she
got home and she was ok

194
00:14:32,25 --> 00:14:34,53
but all the same i began to feel

195
00:14:34,53 --> 00:14:40,40
that you know i really needed to get
the kids away from a situation like

196
00:14:40,40 --> 00:14:44,58
that now that was a decision i had to
make for my own peace of mind and it

197
00:14:44,58 --> 00:14:46,96
and it doesn't mean to say
that children who remained in

198
00:14:46,96 --> 00:14:52,85
that situation haven't emerged just as
wonderful and you know terrific kids.

199
00:14:53,53 --> 00:14:58,05
As could be but for me it was a bit
too uncomfortable to do so for me.

200
00:14:58,09 --> 00:14:58,70
That was one thing

201
00:14:58,70 --> 00:15:05,54
that didn't work out.

202
00:15:05,56 --> 00:15:09,89
Well it was a natural part of life. You
know it was it was a part of life.

203
00:15:10,11 --> 00:15:15,40
It was part of everybody's life i can't
think of anyone who had no experience no

204
00:15:15,40 --> 00:15:19,82
there wouldn't have been anyone who had no
experience of being smoked around them.

205
00:15:20,42 --> 00:15:25,56
And there wouldn't have been many people
who wouldn't you know have a toke of the

206
00:15:25,56 --> 00:15:30,34
joint as it went by. But at

207
00:15:30,34 --> 00:15:33,97
that time also very
importantly in that context.

208
00:15:34,29 --> 00:15:36,50
There was only one
person that i knew of at

209
00:15:36,50 --> 00:15:41,45
that time who lived untouchable fools
who went to the pub who drank at all.

210
00:15:41,46 --> 00:15:46,33
I mean occasionally people would have a
drink and the guys would have a beer

211
00:15:46,33 --> 00:15:47,32
or something like that

212
00:15:47,32 --> 00:15:50,27
but there's only one person who i would
have identified who had a drinking problem.

213
00:15:50,82 --> 00:15:56,62
You know drank all the time and got
drunk and abusive and horrible and.

214
00:15:57,46 --> 00:15:59,73
And it was nobody nobody thought of going.

215
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,17
The pub it was it wasn't part of
our culture to go to the pub..

216
00:16:04,24 --> 00:16:09,09
As time went by that changed
quite dramatically in fact.

217
00:16:09,14 --> 00:16:11,61
But on occasions where i remember

218
00:16:11,61 --> 00:16:16,55
when there was a big police
busted underwear 1978.

219
00:16:16,57 --> 00:16:20,68
And everyone was taken into lismore
and kept in custody all day

220
00:16:20,68 --> 00:16:23,73
and then they were let out in the evening
and then they all went to the pub

221
00:16:24,50 --> 00:16:29,88
and they all got drunk and they they
came back in the tundra the red truck

222
00:16:29,88 --> 00:16:33,01
and you could hear the truck when
it hit the top of the valley and

223
00:16:33,01 --> 00:16:35,09
that from where i live. That
was about two miles away

224
00:16:36,17 --> 00:16:40,05
and you could hear them singing in the
truck as they came down the valley

225
00:16:40,05 --> 00:16:45,50
and they were incredibly drunk and i'd
never seen that before it was the only

226
00:16:45,50 --> 00:16:50,59
and all since actually i've never seen a
whole lot of tangible people incredibly

227
00:16:50,59 --> 00:16:57,80
drunk all in a big pack
it was very unusual.

228
00:16:58,79 --> 00:17:01,64
The drug bust was it was a
debacles from beginning to end

229
00:17:01,64 --> 00:17:03,33
but at the time it was very frightening.

230
00:17:04,66 --> 00:17:04,76
At

231
00:17:04,76 --> 00:17:10,56
that time i suppose there would have been
about him about 200 people living it tangible

232
00:17:10,56 --> 00:17:15,86
in various dwellings some houses in course
of construction some existing houses

233
00:17:15,86 --> 00:17:17,71
and tents and so on.

234
00:17:19,18 --> 00:17:23,85
And it was a simultaneous raid on several
parts of the community because we had

235
00:17:23,85 --> 00:17:27,53
established little hamlets which were
like tiny villages in the valley

236
00:17:28,24 --> 00:17:31,51
that were clustered around central
facilities like you know washing up

237
00:17:31,51 --> 00:17:36,25
and shower and toilet facilities and.

238
00:17:37,19 --> 00:17:38,59
The police arrived before dawn.

239
00:17:38,83 --> 00:17:43,24
It was a commando style raid they
were in there were some uniformed

240
00:17:43,24 --> 00:17:48,71
and some plainclothes police there i've
been sort of army trucks like covered

241
00:17:49,66 --> 00:17:54,51
trucks and and sort of the ones

242
00:17:54,51 --> 00:17:59,16
that came down to near where i lived at the
north end park to a short distance from

243
00:17:59,16 --> 00:18:00,57
where. So i was living

244
00:18:00,57 --> 00:18:03,78
and right next to the house of the
guy who'd originally owned the land

245
00:18:03,78 --> 00:18:07,02
and still had an agreement
after he'd sold it

246
00:18:07,02 --> 00:18:09,33
that he could live there until his death.

247
00:18:10,20 --> 00:18:12,98
And the first person to
become aware before dawn

248
00:18:12,98 --> 00:18:19,18
that they were there was his housekeeper
who was a middle aged nimbin

249
00:18:19,89 --> 00:18:20,56
circulate she was

250
00:18:20,56 --> 00:18:25,90
that you know an original person of the
area who never had anything to do with

251
00:18:25,90 --> 00:18:26,20
marijuana

252
00:18:26,20 --> 00:18:30,78
and who has life had been quite changed
by the advent of 200 hippies into her

253
00:18:30,78 --> 00:18:34,90
backyard. But she was a most loving
and compassionate and tolerant woman

254
00:18:34,90 --> 00:18:38,28
and very friendly with
all of us and very kind.

255
00:18:38,30 --> 00:18:39,47
And it was her birthday

256
00:18:39,47 --> 00:18:45,71
and she woke up to to see this shadow
of a truck coming under the trees

257
00:18:45,71 --> 00:18:50,08
and then these figures in uniforms
with guns jumping out of the truck

258
00:18:50,08 --> 00:18:53,33
and she was absolutely terrified.

259
00:18:53,34 --> 00:18:58,06
As well we all as these guys you
know approached various to wellings

260
00:18:58,06 --> 00:19:03,88
and you know came in and turned everything
upside down looking for marijuana.

261
00:19:04,40 --> 00:19:09,04
Which you know when you think back on
it was very foolish it was august.

262
00:19:09,22 --> 00:19:09,75
You know

263
00:19:09,75 --> 00:19:14,44
and i mean anyone who knows anything about
the marijuana growing season would not

264
00:19:14,44 --> 00:19:16,94
come looking for anything in august.

265
00:19:18,35 --> 00:19:19,26
Anyway they came

266
00:19:19,26 --> 00:19:25,43
and of course they found little
stashes of dope little ends of joints

267
00:19:25,43 --> 00:19:31,21
and stuff in practically every
house they visited naturally and.

268
00:19:31,22 --> 00:19:35,95
And they took people from just
about every household into lismore

269
00:19:35,95 --> 00:19:41,04
and fingerprinted and photographed and
charged them with possession and.

270
00:19:41,06 --> 00:19:42,77
I wasn't among the people arrested

271
00:19:42,77 --> 00:19:45,61
but there were people in my
household who were taken in

272
00:19:46,82 --> 00:19:48,79
and i mean the whole thing
was terribly frightening

273
00:19:48,79 --> 00:19:51,65
and there was so many young
children at wonderful at that time

274
00:19:51,65 --> 00:19:57,26
and for one of their early childhood
experiences to be commando style raid on their

275
00:19:57,26 --> 00:19:59,86
home and the removal
of significant adults.

276
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,19
Their life from their environment people
who died experienced as being harmless

277
00:20:05,19 --> 00:20:12,16
humorous gentle people to be so
violently removed from their

278
00:20:12,16 --> 00:20:15,31
homes was was a really a
shocking thing to happen.

279
00:20:15,33 --> 00:20:19,53
And you know i mean none of us were
living there in order to subject our kids

280
00:20:19,53 --> 00:20:23,43
and ourselves to that kind
of shocking violence.

281
00:20:23,45 --> 00:20:28,84
But it happened and eventually
there as due process was observed

282
00:20:28,84 --> 00:20:31,94
and everyone had to appear in court and.

283
00:20:31,96 --> 00:20:34,88
The scene at the lismore
court house on the day

284
00:20:34,88 --> 00:20:38,14
when the charges were to be
answered was extraordinary.

285
00:20:38,56 --> 00:20:44,45
We had musicians and dancers and people
looking beautiful and soaks and satins

286
00:20:44,45 --> 00:20:50,11
and a festival atmosphere
outside the courthouse and

287
00:20:51,22 --> 00:20:54,81
and some pretty smart lawyers from
sydney as well and a barrister and.

288
00:20:56,28 --> 00:20:58,46
It was discovered quite early in the piece

289
00:20:58,46 --> 00:21:03,54
that the original warranted
actually been invalid.

290
00:21:03,56 --> 00:21:05,47
And the police ended up
with egg on their faces

291
00:21:05,47 --> 00:21:11,46
and all the charges had to be
dropped and nothing came of it but.

292
00:21:12,60 --> 00:21:15,61
What remained was the fact
that we had been violated

293
00:21:15,61 --> 00:21:17,93
that the community had been violated.

294
00:21:18,88 --> 00:21:23,59
Sure it may be that you know if we had
been breaking the law in a big way

295
00:21:23,59 --> 00:21:26,07
or been anyone living there who at

296
00:21:26,07 --> 00:21:29,09
that time was making enormous amounts
of money out of growing marijuana

297
00:21:30,58 --> 00:21:33,03
that there might have been a little
more excuse for it than there was

298
00:21:34,82 --> 00:21:40,09
but then i suppose it's a sort of tax you
pay on turning your back on on some of

299
00:21:40,09 --> 00:21:45,05
the rules of the society and deciding

300
00:21:45,05 --> 00:21:48,69
that you can set up under
a different set of rules.

301
00:21:48,71 --> 00:21:50,40
And we certainly paid

302
00:21:50,40 --> 00:21:55,68
that tax subsequent years
there were people in

303
00:21:55,69 --> 00:22:02,06
that area who were growing a lot
of marijuana for profit. And.

304
00:22:03,87 --> 00:22:05,48
That's never felt very good to me either.

305
00:22:05,59 --> 00:22:10,14
And you know i as that
started to happen i'm.

306
00:22:10,16 --> 00:22:14,27
I began to feel that i wasn't really
interested in that either you know.

307
00:22:14,67 --> 00:22:20,64
And of course a lot of us now who were
you know into the dope culture then

308
00:22:21,80 --> 00:22:26,02
i'm not in it. Now maybe we've grown
out of it or you know whatever

309
00:22:27,57 --> 00:22:32,67
but it did become i think a
little overrepresented it niman

310
00:22:32,67 --> 00:22:38,20
and certainly overrepresented
there now and it's a problem

311
00:22:38,20 --> 00:22:41,58
that that's become a problem
where in the very early years.

312
00:22:43,15 --> 00:22:44,55
It was actually part of a solution.

313
00:22:45,65 --> 00:22:49,65
It wasn't a problem at all and
in fact a lot of people or not.

314
00:22:49,69 --> 00:22:52,05
A lot of people but you know a good dozen

315
00:22:52,05 --> 00:22:57,30
or so people came to nimbin in order to get
away from the cities who had been drug

316
00:22:57,30 --> 00:23:01,50
addicted in the past to hard
drugs like heroin specifically

317
00:23:02,89 --> 00:23:06,10
and they can turn in been in order
to be away from that culture

318
00:23:06,10 --> 00:23:10,44
and successfully stayed away from it
because there wasn't any heroin at nimbin

319
00:23:11,51 --> 00:23:15,29
and the little marijuana that people grew

320
00:23:15,29 --> 00:23:21,82
and sort of shared among themselves was
was used in much the same way as people

321
00:23:21,82 --> 00:23:27,45
have a drinks cabinet in other households
and it was a form of relaxation

322
00:23:27,45 --> 00:23:32,06
and you know some people used
it as a creative stimulant

323
00:23:32,06 --> 00:23:35,89
or whatever and they didn't
seem to be such a problem

324
00:23:35,89 --> 00:23:41,18
but over the years a lot of people
became very dependent on it

325
00:23:41,99 --> 00:23:46,65
and you know i don't believe you can really
be addicted to marijuana unless you're

326
00:23:46,65 --> 00:23:48,97
an addictive personality and you know

327
00:23:48,97 --> 00:23:50,65
that wasn't marijuana it
would be something else

328
00:23:52,38 --> 00:23:54,41
but certainly some of the behaviors.

329
00:23:54,43 --> 00:23:59,58
Later on when when there were people who
become habituated over many years to.

330
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,80
Using large quantities of marijuana

331
00:24:02,79 --> 00:24:08,35
that began to look at you know a bit
weird because it does tend to sap you of

332
00:24:08,35 --> 00:24:14,45
motivation and energy and perhaps more
might have been achieved without it.

333
00:24:16,02 --> 00:24:22,88
Where can i really don't know

334
00:24:24,23 --> 00:24:27,04
but i would say that it certainly
wasn't until the eighties

335
00:24:28,40 --> 00:24:30,68
and i don't know how
far into the eighties.

336
00:24:30,75 --> 00:24:33,21
It's quite an extraordinary
thing for me personally

337
00:24:33,21 --> 00:24:38,24
that you know despite having been part
of the counterculture for so long

338
00:24:38,24 --> 00:24:40,06
and having known hips of junkies

339
00:24:40,06 --> 00:24:45,29
and you know people who've who've been using
i've never actually seen heroin in my

340
00:24:45,29 --> 00:24:45,86
whole life

341
00:24:46,88 --> 00:24:53,83
and so i really i only became conscious
of it i suppose about 80 to 83

342
00:24:55,39 --> 00:24:56,74
that there were people who were using

343
00:24:57,75 --> 00:25:01,59
or at least tasting you know
not actually regular users.

344
00:25:03,35 --> 00:25:05,36
I think it was around that
time that i became aware

345
00:25:05,36 --> 00:25:09,61
that one of the daughter of some people
that i sort of didn't know awfully well

346
00:25:09,61 --> 00:25:12,40
but i knew quite well
and they had a daughter

347
00:25:12,40 --> 00:25:18,44
that time would have been about 17 16
maybe and that she was using and that and

348
00:25:18,44 --> 00:25:21,21
that seemed to me really shocking
and i hadn't really been away at

349
00:25:22,28 --> 00:25:27,34
but then i became aware that there were
other adults who who had been using and

350
00:25:27,34 --> 00:25:28,35
that they were sharing it.

351
00:25:33,29 --> 00:25:34,01
Yes it was

352
00:25:34,01 --> 00:25:39,90
and my kids who are coming
to be close to teenage

353
00:25:39,90 --> 00:25:42,44
and that was very scary

354
00:25:42,44 --> 00:25:46,41
that there was a teenager in town
who you know who'd been offered

355
00:25:46,41 --> 00:25:52,00
and it accepted the use of heroin.
Was quite alarming to me and.

356
00:25:52,71 --> 00:25:59,61
Yeah i didn't feel like it was a good
place to stay once a kids came to

357
00:25:59,61 --> 00:26:01,77
be that. Age. Also because by

358
00:26:01,77 --> 00:26:06,76
that time i was living in the main street
of town which is a very very different

359
00:26:06,76 --> 00:26:11,60
situation from living out in the hills as
most people did i don't think they may

360
00:26:11,60 --> 00:26:13,89
have been two or three other
people living in town.

361
00:26:14,71 --> 00:26:20,20
You know who were part of the sort of new
settler movement and the main street.

362
00:26:20,25 --> 00:26:22,06
It's sort of where it all happens

363
00:26:22,06 --> 00:26:24,46
and it's often said of nimbin
i think it's true that.

364
00:26:25,15 --> 00:26:28,11
It probably doesn't have any
more problems than other places

365
00:26:28,11 --> 00:26:30,81
but at nimbin they're really up front.

366
00:26:30,81 --> 00:26:33,69
They're on the street you can see them
they're not hidden away in alleys

367
00:26:33,69 --> 00:26:41,92
and pushed out of sight under
the carpet sort of thing.

368
00:26:41,94 --> 00:26:47,54
Doing that.

369
00:26:48,68 --> 00:26:49,03
You know i think

370
00:26:49,03 --> 00:26:53,38
that is one of what in a way it's a problem
in another way it's it's one of the

371
00:26:53,38 --> 00:26:57,17
great blessings of nimbin that they're
that it's such a tolerant community

372
00:26:57,17 --> 00:26:59,22
and so tolerant of deviance

373
00:27:01,30 --> 00:27:05,57
but there's a sense in which that was okay

374
00:27:05,57 --> 00:27:07,97
when we were in a you know early twenties

375
00:27:07,97 --> 00:27:14,76
and we were as a group of people we
tended to throw the baby out with the

376
00:27:14,76 --> 00:27:18,67
bathwater. You know we'd
thrown out all the.

377
00:27:18,68 --> 00:27:21,93
Customs and belief systems and values

378
00:27:21,93 --> 00:27:24,00
that our parents had
sort of instilled in us

379
00:27:25,98 --> 00:27:31,18
and were gradually re assimilating
what seemed to be important to us

380
00:27:32,01 --> 00:27:36,07
and holding onto a certain
perhaps a new set of values

381
00:27:36,07 --> 00:27:41,31
that we created for ourselves we were
certainly creating a whole new culture.

382
00:27:41,33 --> 00:27:43,63
And so in

383
00:27:43,63 --> 00:27:50,63
that sense we were very open to new
definitions of what was right and wrong.

384
00:27:50,67 --> 00:27:54,03
What was ok and not ok and that was fine

385
00:27:54,03 --> 00:28:00,24
but i think as we've grown now and we're
now in our 30s 40s and fifa. Did.

386
00:28:01,23 --> 00:28:03,63
Most of us who were there
then you know forties now.

387
00:28:04,91 --> 00:28:09,08
I think we've needed to to set a few more
limits than we've been prepared to set

388
00:28:09,08 --> 00:28:13,13
and that is time for that now and
we haven't done quite enough of it.

389
00:28:16,88 --> 00:28:22,61
From myself.

390
00:28:25,14 --> 00:28:30,05
Well i hope we've grown wiser and
we've certainly grown older and

391
00:28:30,06 --> 00:28:30,96
that doesn't mean to say

392
00:28:30,96 --> 00:28:36,34
that there isn't an extraordinary youthfulness
about as well you know for being in

393
00:28:36,34 --> 00:28:41,01
our forties and fifties we're still
ready at the drop of a hat for a rage

394
00:28:41,01 --> 00:28:47,35
and dance and you know i mean we're very
energetic people for you know despite.

395
00:28:48,08 --> 00:28:49,30
Almost unbelievable age

396
00:28:50,58 --> 00:28:54,74
and i think there's something
about having spent those years

397
00:28:54,74 --> 00:28:57,72
that mean that's kept us
mentally very youthful

398
00:28:57,72 --> 00:29:02,42
and spiritually youthful.

399
00:29:04,16 --> 00:29:07,58
Go back to a time.

400
00:29:07,60 --> 00:29:16,29
Role.

401
00:29:16,31 --> 00:29:20,42
Yeah. The roles of men

402
00:29:20,42 --> 00:29:25,65
and women on tangible in particularly
in the earlier years were not

403
00:29:25,65 --> 00:29:29,83
that dissimilar from out in the
rest of society in the sense

404
00:29:29,83 --> 00:29:33,15
that the women tended to
get the household duties

405
00:29:33,15 --> 00:29:38,82
and the men tended to be out there
doing whatever they did out there

406
00:29:38,82 --> 00:29:43,56
and in the case of tangible that was
largely a matter of clearing a site

407
00:29:43,56 --> 00:29:45,83
and building a house.

408
00:29:45,85 --> 00:29:52,52
And it wasn't so much divided along
sexist lines per say as it was down to

409
00:29:52,52 --> 00:29:57,06
whose physical energy was most
appropriate to the task and given

410
00:29:57,06 --> 00:29:59,92
that most of the women who were there
and there weren't many women there.

411
00:30:01,09 --> 00:30:01,81
There were nearly all men

412
00:30:02,71 --> 00:30:07,55
and women who were there were generally
either in relationship with a guy

413
00:30:07,55 --> 00:30:12,23
or was single parent so babies
were involved in nearly every case

414
00:30:13,65 --> 00:30:13,96
and

415
00:30:14,82 --> 00:30:19,14
that being the case it was more sensible
for the guy to be the one who was clearing

416
00:30:19,14 --> 00:30:20,71
the site and building the house

417
00:30:21,84 --> 00:30:25,09
and for the woman to be the one who
was washing the nappies in a bucket.

418
00:30:25,36 --> 00:30:28,01
You know with no washing
machine or anything like that

419
00:30:29,03 --> 00:30:32,86
and keeping an eye on the kids and
that's not to say that that was rigid

420
00:30:32,86 --> 00:30:36,06
but it was generally how it fell.

421
00:30:36,08 --> 00:30:41,75
And we used to have a women's group
that met in nimbin once a week and

422
00:30:41,75 --> 00:30:43,32
that was the one night of the week

423
00:30:43,32 --> 00:30:45,90
when the guys got the kids no
matter how they felt about it

424
00:30:45,90 --> 00:30:48,98
and there was you know quite a
lot of uproar about that too.

425
00:30:50,41 --> 00:30:55,15
And city feminists who visited our
meeting were absolutely appalled

426
00:30:55,15 --> 00:30:58,93
that we you know first of all had to fight
with our guys to get them to look after

427
00:30:58,93 --> 00:31:02,99
the kids one night a week so we go
to a meeting but also the rest of it

428
00:31:02,99 --> 00:31:06,69
that you know that that in their
view it was it was divided.

429
00:31:06,88 --> 00:31:10,95
So rigidly along sexist
lines of occupation

430
00:31:12,10 --> 00:31:15,84
but from our point of view you know me
more than anything we come here for peace

431
00:31:15,84 --> 00:31:21,70
and harmony and happiness and that seemed
to be the way that we were you know

432
00:31:21,70 --> 00:31:23,66
that things would be most
peaceful and harmonious.
