1
00:00:15,36 --> 00:00:16,34
So good.

2
00:00:19,27 --> 00:00:26,12
So yes.

3
00:00:30,76 --> 00:00:33,80
Hello. I am.

4
00:00:33,83 --> 00:00:38,84
Terry mcgee and i mean this nym

5
00:00:38,84 --> 00:00:45,73
and story because i was a participant
of at the original aquarius festival

6
00:00:45,73 --> 00:00:51,40
who stayed on. I came.

7
00:00:51,77 --> 00:00:57,00
A few weeks before the festival
a friend of mine bob craven and

8
00:00:57,00 --> 00:01:01,06
and others were here working
as part of the organisation

9
00:01:02,01 --> 00:01:07,93
and i came up did a bit of help in
the architectural team beforehand

10
00:01:08,90 --> 00:01:10,16
and then this here for the festival.

11
00:01:13,52 --> 00:01:18,43
I suppose the.

12
00:01:18,45 --> 00:01:24,79
My further relevance why i'm still sort
of talking about it is because at the end

13
00:01:24,79 --> 00:01:30,52
of the festival there was one workshop
being chaired by richard neville

14
00:01:31,70 --> 00:01:38,47
and to discuss later. Communities
being formed in the area.

15
00:01:38,49 --> 00:01:43,93
After the festival and
i was at the workshop.

16
00:01:45,57 --> 00:01:46,34
We talk for hours.

17
00:01:48,12 --> 00:01:54,91
Richard neville invited one
particular person to organise some

18
00:01:54,92 --> 00:01:59,43
sort of. After the festival process.

19
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,49
And i guess i had a feeling that

20
00:02:04,49 --> 00:02:10,70
that particular person was not going to
be incredibly successful in doing it

21
00:02:11,57 --> 00:02:18,33
and i simply set about with some
discussions with ken yeomans son of a key

22
00:02:18,33 --> 00:02:22,16
line. Irrigation farmer.

23
00:02:23,09 --> 00:02:25,76
I set about.

24
00:02:26,75 --> 00:02:33,06
Starting to nibble force registering
the cooperative arranging the

25
00:02:34,04 --> 00:02:38,26
deal on the land and then.

26
00:02:39,11 --> 00:02:43,27
Going through the process of
trying to build up an organization

27
00:02:43,27 --> 00:02:49,54
that the cooperative when it was
registered would be the legal.

28
00:02:50,36 --> 00:02:53,31
Part of it.

29
00:02:54,81 --> 00:02:57,44
And i hadn't come with
an intention to stay.

30
00:02:57,46 --> 00:03:02,90
I came with the possibility i mean i didn't
i'd i don't always thought about moving

31
00:03:02,90 --> 00:03:06,83
up to the north coast of new
south wales but i expected that.

32
00:03:06,85 --> 00:03:07,63
Any place

33
00:03:07,63 --> 00:03:11,72
that i would want to would
be right on the coast

34
00:03:14,10 --> 00:03:18,55
and so i hadn't expected to
come up with to decide to do

35
00:03:18,55 --> 00:03:24,07
that. Challenge of.

36
00:03:26,15 --> 00:03:26,69
The challenge that.

37
00:03:30,75 --> 00:03:34,11
I may have a story writer
and one of the stories

38
00:03:34,11 --> 00:03:40,86
that i was writing in and still
haven't finished at that at

39
00:03:40,86 --> 00:03:43,95
that time was the story of a

40
00:03:44,91 --> 00:03:51,67
and a large island where people
were coming in from overseas

41
00:03:51,67 --> 00:03:55,53
sort of almost in their dreams.

42
00:03:55,54 --> 00:03:59,21
To build new communities to.

43
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,97
Get away from various old world problems

44
00:04:05,46 --> 00:04:10,18
and so i just sort of automatically
thought to myself of

45
00:04:10,18 --> 00:04:15,46
that this was part of
the grounding of making

46
00:04:15,46 --> 00:04:22,21
that story a very real very
detailed being able to help on

47
00:04:22,21 --> 00:04:26,49
details of that story.
I also thought that.

48
00:04:26,50 --> 00:04:29,22
Because of the festival.

49
00:04:29,24 --> 00:04:31,28
And some of the people that we're here

50
00:04:32,04 --> 00:04:38,05
that there was the spirit in
terms of an artistic community

51
00:04:39,21 --> 00:04:44,94
one that was interested in a lot of.

52
00:04:46,65 --> 00:04:50,94
A lot of thoughts a lot
of new ideas and that.

53
00:04:51,50 --> 00:04:55,39
This might in fact be a better
such place than one on the coast

54
00:04:55,39 --> 00:05:08,47
that would get distracted by
the the joys of the beach.

55
00:05:13,37 --> 00:05:16,03
It was more the color. The background.

56
00:05:17,33 --> 00:05:22,22
It was almost like a movie
that was a great movie

57
00:05:22,22 --> 00:05:25,23
but they forgot to put
in part of the story.

58
00:05:25,26 --> 00:05:32,02
There was no connecting story and
i felt that at the time i felt

59
00:05:32,02 --> 00:05:33,52
that part of that reason was

60
00:05:33,52 --> 00:05:40,07
that because it had been centered
on the town instead of it.

61
00:05:41,48 --> 00:05:47,28
One of the other options before the festival
was to try to arrange town a bill for

62
00:05:48,08 --> 00:05:51,69
the whole property as the
festival site and if

63
00:05:51,69 --> 00:05:55,44
that would have been the case then the
festival would have there would have been a

64
00:05:55,44 --> 00:05:59,88
story of the building of a new
town creating the starting of.

65
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,14
When new town village but because it was
transitory in that sense of the coming

66
00:06:06,14 --> 00:06:09,49
and going. It.

67
00:06:10,03 --> 00:06:15,68
It was almost. How does crime.

68
00:06:16,28 --> 00:06:19,48
The best way that i thought
of later was to talk.

69
00:06:19,55 --> 00:06:21,34
I had images of some songs

70
00:06:21,34 --> 00:06:27,23
and story of ghosts walking along the
streets of nimbin after the festival

71
00:06:28,20 --> 00:06:31,27
and that there. Here was
this little country town

72
00:06:31,27 --> 00:06:36,22
that had been so incredibly
alive like like a 30

73
00:06:36,22 --> 00:06:41,03
or 40 thousand people village because
all of its not that there were

74
00:06:41,03 --> 00:06:47,19
that many people but all of its residents
were very active they were going out

75
00:06:47,19 --> 00:06:54,18
and so you had this big. Artistic town.

76
00:06:55,23 --> 00:06:58,28
And then it was totally empty
and it was full of ghosts.

77
00:06:58,56 --> 00:07:04,67
Well it sort of like the story
that goes to hell is hard to.

78
00:07:04,68 --> 00:07:08,58
It's hard to actually capture on
film. Because when you shoot it.

79
00:07:09,88 --> 00:07:12,55
You can't see the ghosts and you
can't hear what they're saying

80
00:07:13,78 --> 00:07:20,71
but you see the color.

81
00:07:21,93 --> 00:07:22,92
The ghosts are

82
00:07:22,92 --> 00:07:28,68
but the they haven't made themselves
particularly more visible there.

83
00:07:29,36 --> 00:07:30,79
The.

84
00:07:32,34 --> 00:07:32,78
I don't think

85
00:07:32,78 --> 00:07:44,04
that it's the town itself has moved
a huge distance from its potential.

86
00:07:46,45 --> 00:07:52,71
Its potential is i've
something where there's a.

87
00:07:52,73 --> 00:07:57,70
An artistic economic life
that requires a town.

88
00:07:59,44 --> 00:08:01,95
There's not. That level of of.

89
00:08:02,81 --> 00:08:05,76
Real solid artistic business

90
00:08:07,26 --> 00:08:13,58
that is being done to justify
its existence of the town

91
00:08:13,58 --> 00:08:18,01
its existence as a town is a story
called that there was a town there

92
00:08:18,01 --> 00:08:20,53
that was empty and was not
being used very much.

93
00:08:22,22 --> 00:08:25,97
Because all of its not all but one
half of its residents were pensioners

94
00:08:25,97 --> 00:08:32,07
and so they were just enjoying this
beautiful little town but it wasn't.

95
00:08:32,29 --> 00:08:37,06
It wasn't doing much and it wasn't very
alive it wasn't doing a lot of business

96
00:08:37,94 --> 00:08:43,78
and. The things that could have
occurred during the festival

97
00:08:43,78 --> 00:08:48,30
or straight after the
festival would didn't occur

98
00:08:48,30 --> 00:08:53,58
and haven't occurred yet even
with all this business activity.

99
00:08:53,79 --> 00:08:56,58
You know new shops opening
in town at the moment.

100
00:08:56,59 --> 00:09:00,45
They know they're not touching
anything like that the tension

101
00:09:00,45 --> 00:09:05,51
or for a true arts centre.
Alternative art centre.

102
00:09:06,18 --> 00:09:10,17
Alternative arts capital of
australia or whatever you can go

103
00:09:10,17 --> 00:09:14,22
and choose lots of sort of ways to
describe most likely at the moment.

104
00:09:14,41 --> 00:09:18,11
Byron bay is more of an art centre.

105
00:09:18,32 --> 00:09:25,18
And there's more than there niman anyway.

106
00:09:27,62 --> 00:09:31,68
I think it's more the the whole economic.

107
00:09:31,70 --> 00:09:37,33
The whole week anomic
superstructure the whole sense of

108
00:09:38,80 --> 00:09:45,77
taking. Taking taking the business
side of it all. Seriously.

109
00:09:46,41 --> 00:09:51,74
I guess it's in many ways you get the
feeling of people running around making a

110
00:09:51,74 --> 00:09:53,56
movie but the movie never gets made.

111
00:09:55,26 --> 00:09:59,86
Well the other classic example
is that all fours hall. It's.

112
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,96
Under can stick beautiful structure

113
00:10:02,91 --> 00:10:07,00
and it's it's a really beautiful
really elegant really nicely design

114
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:10,65
but it's been under
construction for 16 years now.

115
00:10:10,67 --> 00:10:16,56
Something like 16 years. Whereas
over it. So a billion cliffs.

116
00:10:17,58 --> 00:10:23,28
There's been quite a beautiful new
craft center build in three months

117
00:10:24,90 --> 00:10:29,80
and it's completed it's
opening next weekend and

118
00:10:29,81 --> 00:10:33,21
that sort of frustration
at this beautiful hall.

119
00:10:34,33 --> 00:10:36,60
That is is quite stunning

120
00:10:36,60 --> 00:10:41,54
and is the sort of classic
ingredients for a very artistic

121
00:10:43,02 --> 00:10:48,92
but business. Real artistic
as in art that makes money.

122
00:10:51,05 --> 00:10:57,14
Is this whole that would be beautiful part
of that is incomplete. After 15 years.

123
00:10:58,40 --> 00:11:04,53
And the way.

124
00:11:06,26 --> 00:11:10,00
I think it's the different
parts of of life

125
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:15,94
that the communities been
able to face up to one

126
00:11:15,95 --> 00:11:20,60
or two whole aspects very
very well. Brilliantly.

127
00:11:20,62 --> 00:11:27,59
But haven't gone beyond those
in a organized way if you

128
00:11:27,59 --> 00:11:31,71
look at the whole.

129
00:11:31,73 --> 00:11:38,18
If you look at the the development
of a of a community from scratch

130
00:11:38,18 --> 00:11:40,18
such as at a time before.

131
00:11:40,75 --> 00:11:44,19
And really you can treat the
whole of the nim and valley in

132
00:11:44,19 --> 00:11:50,99
that way because the a number
of people and houses and.

133
00:11:51,75 --> 00:11:53,81
Other things for people to do other than.

134
00:11:54,34 --> 00:11:59,73
Milk cows the level of that
in this valley 20 years ago.

135
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:06,53
It was a fairly low level there
wasn't a huge amount of of us

136
00:12:06,54 --> 00:12:07,93
develop space

137
00:12:09,89 --> 00:12:12,28
and time to go

138
00:12:13,73 --> 00:12:19,89
when it started got pretty
straight into two parts.

139
00:12:20,39 --> 00:12:22,01
Namely of.

140
00:12:22,03 --> 00:12:26,99
Building houses and growing fruit trees

141
00:12:28,24 --> 00:12:34,61
and real forestation now at that level
taliban has worked brilliantly.

142
00:12:36,55 --> 00:12:43,44
There's a huge number of really
beautiful houses very laid back into

143
00:12:43,44 --> 00:12:47,44
the environment. Very non obtrusive.

144
00:12:47,45 --> 00:12:50,64
A lot of really good fruit trees

145
00:12:50,64 --> 00:12:56,22
and other trees throughout the whole
property the regrowth down in the valley has

146
00:12:56,22 --> 00:12:59,79
been really beautiful and the.

147
00:12:59,81 --> 00:13:04,16
The way that there are so many trees
and the orchards are broken up.

148
00:13:05,18 --> 00:13:10,57
Has really minimized insect. Problems.

149
00:13:11,57 --> 00:13:17,14
But then beyond those two aspects
of the whole tree agricultural

150
00:13:18,08 --> 00:13:24,28
and the housing. The whole other
levels of mechanical economics

151
00:13:24,28 --> 00:13:31,24
and post mechanical economics.
Have have only been at a.

152
00:13:31,61 --> 00:13:32,50
Early stage

153
00:13:32,50 --> 00:13:38,26
and there's been a really
strong argument against

154
00:13:38,26 --> 00:13:42,72
and being dealt with at a community level.

155
00:13:43,85 --> 00:13:49,46
If in the early days of tenable force there
was a strong desire amongst a lot of

156
00:13:49,46 --> 00:13:52,75
people to limit tenable forces.

157
00:13:52,96 --> 00:13:58,78
As activities to housing and tree gardens.

158
00:14:00,29 --> 00:14:03,41
And.

159
00:14:03,43 --> 00:14:06,45
There's there's that sort of kept on

160
00:14:06,45 --> 00:14:11,77
and overridden throughout the whole valley
there's a large fear of development

161
00:14:13,44 --> 00:14:15,64
which amongst not everyone.

162
00:14:15,99 --> 00:14:18,00
Maybe not amongst the majority

163
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:21,61
but certainly amongst a very
strong number of people

164
00:14:21,61 --> 00:14:23,21
and they feel it very strongly

165
00:14:24,27 --> 00:14:30,72
and they try to put a whole inference
of badness against any economic

166
00:14:30,73 --> 00:14:35,46
activity that is not at their scale and

167
00:14:36,43 --> 00:14:43,41
that ends up with a real real
difficulty a real hard a

168
00:14:43,41 --> 00:14:46,83
hard press.

169
00:14:46,84 --> 00:14:52,47
I suppose you could say it just puts
anyone who's trying to do things

170
00:14:52,47 --> 00:14:54,16
that are not house building

171
00:14:54,16 --> 00:15:01,03
or a tree garden orientated at a major
disadvantage where they have to carry out

172
00:15:01,03 --> 00:15:12,96
a lot of extra trouble a lot of extra
weight in order to do the same job.

173
00:15:15,22 --> 00:15:20,23
Yes it's it's. One of the.

174
00:15:22,60 --> 00:15:28,51
One of the aspects of why
there's it's been difficult to

175
00:15:29,75 --> 00:15:36,32
get our community level planning
on on economics beyond the house

176
00:15:36,32 --> 00:15:43,97
and gardens has been part of the
origins of the festival itself.

177
00:15:43,99 --> 00:15:47,19
In so many people coming up.

178
00:15:48,15 --> 00:15:55,09
And being part of the festival who had a
vietnam protest orientation before they

179
00:15:55,09 --> 00:15:59,39
came. And when you're dealing with.

180
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,54
No tests the name classic
example the key thing

181
00:16:04,54 --> 00:16:10,11
that you're always centering on
is saying no you are constantly

182
00:16:11,60 --> 00:16:15,65
coming up with a million brilliant
arguments and a million.

183
00:16:17,07 --> 00:16:21,65
Brilliant ways og saying no
i'm trying to stop things

184
00:16:23,27 --> 00:16:26,85
and in fact of course when
the terrain your issue.

185
00:16:27,29 --> 00:16:28,77
Blew up up here to

186
00:16:29,58 --> 00:16:35,48
that then double tailed completely into
the ecological question of saying no.

187
00:16:36,69 --> 00:16:42,46
I'm concentrating on stopping things of
learning how to stop things of spending

188
00:16:42,46 --> 00:16:46,50
investing your life's effort
in learning how to say no

189
00:16:46,50 --> 00:16:52,90
and to stop things as a moral good

190
00:16:54,46 --> 00:16:59,00
not only learning it as a skill
but actually investing it with

191
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:05,82
that is the moral good thing.
And anyone who is not doing.

192
00:17:06,26 --> 00:17:06,91
Learning

193
00:17:06,91 --> 00:17:12,40
and specializing in how to say
no is doing something bad

194
00:17:14,17 --> 00:17:17,33
and that that's been there.

195
00:17:18,25 --> 00:17:25,19
Right for a huge amount of the years
we we had a lot of debates in nimbin

196
00:17:26,38 --> 00:17:27,56
where graham dunstan.

197
00:17:27,86 --> 00:17:30,32
And some other people were trying to argue

198
00:17:30,32 --> 00:17:35,25
that we had to keep the
whole of the valley.

199
00:17:35,27 --> 00:17:40,51
Only working on spontaneous
structures and i argued the case

200
00:17:40,51 --> 00:17:43,23
that it had to be on ongoing structures

201
00:17:43,23 --> 00:17:50,11
that had the capacity for spontaneity
as distinct from demanding

202
00:17:50,11 --> 00:17:54,69
that the structures be
spontaneous structures.

203
00:17:55,98 --> 00:17:59,17
The reality is that for structures
that are going to say no.

204
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,33
That are going to oppose things you
only need a spontaneous structure.

205
00:18:05,53 --> 00:18:10,14
However graeme dunstan's now come back
to town wanting to do a 20 year festival

206
00:18:10,14 --> 00:18:12,49
next year and he is really frustrated

207
00:18:12,49 --> 00:18:19,20
that there's no ongoing structure
that's capable of helping him do that.

208
00:18:19,22 --> 00:18:23,26
It's it's with the.

209
00:18:24,62 --> 00:18:26,38
It just runs with the philosophy

210
00:18:26,38 --> 00:18:32,29
that if people practice it saying no too
often they in fact find it difficult to

211
00:18:33,50 --> 00:18:39,41
understand how difficult it is to get
new things occurring to write a play

212
00:18:40,53 --> 00:18:45,03
to put on a play to do a
musical to start a business.

213
00:18:45,05 --> 00:18:47,18
To do a musical is to start a business.

214
00:18:47,53 --> 00:18:50,77
You can't the the number of people

215
00:18:50,77 --> 00:18:54,14
that you're going to involve the amount
of time that you're going to ask of them.

216
00:18:55,55 --> 00:18:59,11
The amount of extra
materials and resources

217
00:18:59,11 --> 00:19:02,80
that you're going to need is
equal to a small business

218
00:19:03,73 --> 00:19:08,36
and i suppose i've always had
some level of our intention of

219
00:19:08,37 --> 00:19:10,87
that of how difficult getting something

220
00:19:10,87 --> 00:19:22,01
that does not exist to actually exist.

221
00:19:23,28 --> 00:19:27,39
Change direction.

222
00:19:28,16 --> 00:19:32,24
Next. Role.

223
00:19:35,74 --> 00:19:42,17
Beyond it beyond the
houses and three gardens.

224
00:19:42,18 --> 00:19:47,88
Getting other things to occur requires a

225
00:19:47,88 --> 00:19:52,81
and irian tatian but that means

226
00:19:52,82 --> 00:19:54,99
that they have to actually get them self

227
00:19:54,99 --> 00:19:59,85
and other people to agree on
how to do things together.

228
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,85
All business or things

229
00:20:03,86 --> 00:20:10,44
that require 20 30 people tend to work
together involve business transactions

230
00:20:11,32 --> 00:20:12,50
whether it's running a pre-school

231
00:20:12,50 --> 00:20:18,79
or whatever you have to get a number of
people agreeing saying yes to putting in a

232
00:20:18,79 --> 00:20:25,20
lot of effort in order to get a whole
range of things coordinated together.

233
00:20:25,22 --> 00:20:28,52
And that irian tatian
is i suppose something

234
00:20:28,53 --> 00:20:35,43
that alone has taken a fair
while in nimbin we early on it.

235
00:20:35,43 --> 00:20:42,36
Tenable fours gave up the idea of
trying to get a lot of houses built by

236
00:20:42,36 --> 00:20:44,54
a building unit for instance.

237
00:20:45,13 --> 00:20:49,43
That's one of the possibilities
we could have looked at but it.

238
00:20:49,45 --> 00:20:51,12
We weren't going to be able to agree on.

239
00:20:51,62 --> 00:20:56,58
Many of the details and so it was going
to be a lot easier for people to go out

240
00:20:56,58 --> 00:20:59,03
and build their own houses and in fact

241
00:20:59,03 --> 00:21:05,34
that has had the major advantage of there
being an incredibly low mortgage debt

242
00:21:05,35 --> 00:21:06,67
level.

243
00:21:09,34 --> 00:21:12,67
But it also has meant that that.

244
00:21:12,68 --> 00:21:19,74
Part of the of the economy of
housebuilding has not existed.

245
00:21:19,75 --> 00:21:24,05
And if you look at australian nation
national statistics you will see

246
00:21:24,05 --> 00:21:28,33
that the building industry the home building
industry is a large percentage of the

247
00:21:28,33 --> 00:21:32,10
overall economy. Well in nimbin.

248
00:21:32,50 --> 00:21:39,27
That part of the economy has only been
one quarter of the size for this for the

249
00:21:39,27 --> 00:21:40,39
purdah population.

250
00:21:40,51 --> 00:21:45,43
It's only been a quarter of the size
because of people building their own home

251
00:21:45,44 --> 00:21:50,63
that means that the whole other economics
of the area are also slowed down

252
00:21:52,17 --> 00:21:55,30
and it also means that all of those people

253
00:21:55,30 --> 00:21:59,33
that would normally have
experience in doing business.

254
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,44
Building houses have not had that
experience. So it. It's really.

255
00:22:06,12 --> 00:22:10,37
I just i still think the easiest way for
nimbin in the future would be to take it

256
00:22:10,37 --> 00:22:17,34
on consciously into a mat
learning how to create businesses

257
00:22:17,34 --> 00:22:18,29
consciously

258
00:22:19,21 --> 00:22:24,23
and i mean in a fairly open information
system where people throughout the whole

259
00:22:24,23 --> 00:22:27,88
community can know what the
business is doing in economic terms

260
00:22:29,27 --> 00:22:29,81
and how

261
00:22:31,27 --> 00:22:35,89
and seeing the actual business
is growing in overall turnover

262
00:22:35,89 --> 00:22:39,24
and seeing how much
more they're producing.

263
00:22:39,26 --> 00:22:40,01
So

264
00:22:40,01 --> 00:22:46,42
that then the whole community could have
a sense of a level of economic growth.

265
00:22:48,08 --> 00:22:49,81
And could actually have its own figures

266
00:22:49,81 --> 00:22:56,45
and to cystic so i think it comes down
to a question where you remain poor

267
00:22:57,74 --> 00:23:03,24
if you think your poor and
if you start to decide

268
00:23:03,24 --> 00:23:05,18
that you're not really very poor

269
00:23:06,28 --> 00:23:12,98
and you can actually justify what you're
doing then you can change your economic

270
00:23:12,99 --> 00:23:20,71
status from poor to well off
simply from a change of attitude.

271
00:23:21,72 --> 00:23:27,39
You talk about.

272
00:23:27,40 --> 00:23:30,24
Yeah.

273
00:23:32,03 --> 00:23:37,15
You know i don't think it should
make itself part of the system

274
00:23:37,15 --> 00:23:42,88
but i think it should stop pretending
that the system doesn't exist except

275
00:23:43,61 --> 00:23:44,75
when it wants something off it.

276
00:23:47,32 --> 00:23:52,22
I mean the fact that new guinea
exists or indonesia exists.

277
00:23:52,41 --> 00:23:56,14
If you recognize it exists that doesn't
mean that you have to be part of it

278
00:23:56,14 --> 00:23:59,54
but you do have to
recognise it's legitimate.

279
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,28
See in its own place and you have to be
able to compare yourself against it.

280
00:24:06,18 --> 00:24:11,27
And likewise niman could
have its own currency but

281
00:24:11,28 --> 00:24:16,65
that currency would have to be real against
the australian dollar you can have its

282
00:24:16,65 --> 00:24:23,51
own economy but that economy has to be
real against the australian economy.

283
00:24:23,53 --> 00:24:24,81
I just read the other day

284
00:24:24,81 --> 00:24:31,35
that deca in bangladesh
has 1 6 16 per cent one

285
00:24:31,35 --> 00:24:36,76
sixth of its total economic
work is on rickshaws

286
00:24:37,78 --> 00:24:39,23
and they don't call them rickshaws but

287
00:24:39,23 --> 00:24:45,80
that the whole the whole wheeling
of people by human effort

288
00:24:46,63 --> 00:24:53,59
on the back of two wheeled carts is
one sixth of the total workforce

289
00:24:53,59 --> 00:24:55,25
of decker's job.

290
00:24:55,51 --> 00:24:57,84
Either in building them repairing them

291
00:24:57,84 --> 00:25:04,34
or doing the wheeling now that's
economically real inside dhaka.

292
00:25:04,54 --> 00:25:09,28
But it's not a very wise use of labour.

293
00:25:09,29 --> 00:25:12,73
And likewise in nim and.

294
00:25:13,74 --> 00:25:18,37
The question you don't have to be be
part of the system in order to realize

295
00:25:18,37 --> 00:25:20,37
that economics does actually exist

296
00:25:20,37 --> 00:25:25,86
and even if no one talks about it then
every day of the week a certain number of

297
00:25:25,86 --> 00:25:28,03
people are going to be
building some houses

298
00:25:28,03 --> 00:25:30,54
and some other people are
going to be doing this

299
00:25:30,54 --> 00:25:32,27
and some people are
going to be doing that.

300
00:25:32,47 --> 00:25:37,24
I mean you've only got a limited
number of people in any one valley

301
00:25:38,02 --> 00:25:41,67
and they are only going to do a
certain amount of work each week

302
00:25:42,48 --> 00:25:46,52
and some more we do. More and
that that amount can lift

303
00:25:46,52 --> 00:25:48,39
and drop depending on how they feel.

304
00:25:49,37 --> 00:25:52,02
But as soon as you start talking
about what people are doing

305
00:25:52,02 --> 00:25:58,17
and whether people are getting
themselves poorer or richer.

306
00:25:59,16 --> 00:26:05,18
Then you're talking about. Economics.

307
00:26:05,96 --> 00:26:10,76
Probably right. Lost. I mean. I think.

308
00:26:12,11 --> 00:26:15,57
Well. I think you know.

309
00:26:16,51 --> 00:26:22,81
It's a time of their elected not a lot
of ways in which they live. The way.

310
00:26:23,37 --> 00:26:30,25
You know except if you look at include
one extra factor in there of whether

311
00:26:30,25 --> 00:26:34,83
they feel that they are poor or well off

312
00:26:36,95 --> 00:26:42,42
when you look at a ton of all fours
that some really interesting examples

313
00:26:42,42 --> 00:26:45,61
and comparisons that you can make.

314
00:26:45,63 --> 00:26:48,40
And one of the factors of value

315
00:26:49,36 --> 00:26:56,76
that i think you have to take into
it is is a person free to move.

316
00:26:56,77 --> 00:27:00,09
It's all very well to
have a beautiful house

317
00:27:00,09 --> 00:27:05,29
and lots of really beautiful
things about the place.

318
00:27:05,89 --> 00:27:07,98
It's the environment is spectacular

319
00:27:09,61 --> 00:27:14,65
and the lifestyle can be very enjoyable
if you think you got the right to leave

320
00:27:17,02 --> 00:27:20,53
even heaven can be a terrible
place if you feel trapped there.

321
00:27:22,27 --> 00:27:28,19
Now with tana well there's
because of the headspace

322
00:27:29,69 --> 00:27:36,12
there is a poverty a poverty back here

323
00:27:37,31 --> 00:27:40,91
that holds people in there when
they may not want to be there.

324
00:27:42,12 --> 00:27:46,22
The comparison is really easy and with
another place in the district court.

325
00:27:46,24 --> 00:27:48,30
Bill includes which was started.

326
00:27:49,43 --> 00:27:56,79
10 years after tournament was just had
its 10 year anniversary a few weeks ago.

327
00:27:56,81 --> 00:27:59,90
And a billion cliffs.

328
00:28:02,08 --> 00:28:08,68
Which is the second biggest community
around here after town of all fours.

329
00:28:09,92 --> 00:28:15,60
People who joined it 10 years ago the
first people paid $4000 for a share

330
00:28:18,78 --> 00:28:21,69
and i think it ranged from four
up to about eight nine thousand.

331
00:28:23,64 --> 00:28:25,90
Those people are now the minimum amount

332
00:28:26,80 --> 00:28:33,75
that if they wish to leave their empty
block of land is now worth twenty two

333
00:28:33,75 --> 00:28:40,54
thousand dollars. Empty
and that's the minimum.

334
00:28:41,96 --> 00:28:48,54
So they're for their for what they've
put in they don't feel trapped

335
00:28:48,54 --> 00:28:50,18
and in the sense

336
00:28:50,18 --> 00:28:52,89
that they have to stay there because
they can't afford to go anywhere else.

337
00:28:54,42 --> 00:28:57,04
Whereas at the same time
i know of one situation.

338
00:28:57,56 --> 00:29:04,50
A friend of mine where he if he sold his

339
00:29:04,50 --> 00:29:08,12
house and land a ton of all fours.

340
00:29:08,29 --> 00:29:14,79
He would only be getting something
in the 20s with the house as well.

341
00:29:17,15 --> 00:29:18,25
There's no in fact

342
00:29:18,25 --> 00:29:25,19
that the house whose house it at
all is far more beautiful than.

343
00:29:25,21 --> 00:29:30,60
Lots of thing places are doing cliffs.

344
00:29:30,61 --> 00:29:33,82
But because of the structure

345
00:29:33,82 --> 00:29:37,16
and the head space tenable
force thinks it's poor

346
00:29:39,11 --> 00:29:42,39
and therefore people who.

347
00:29:42,41 --> 00:29:46,76
Are thinking of coming in are only
willing to pay small amounts of money.

348
00:29:47,87 --> 00:29:51,50
Now that means that someone
who is there a ton of oil.

349
00:29:51,51 --> 00:29:57,43
It's not actually worth their while to sell
because for what they'll get they won't

350
00:29:57,43 --> 00:30:00,76
be able to go very far in
terms. As of any other house.

351
00:30:00,91 --> 00:30:04,95
If they sell they will be have
to use their money just for.

352
00:30:04,97 --> 00:30:08,26
Living in the period of time
before they have anything else

353
00:30:09,60 --> 00:30:11,30
that means a person isn't free to move.

354
00:30:12,81 --> 00:30:17,85
Now what's the whole lesson that's
been going on out of east europe

355
00:30:17,85 --> 00:30:23,62
and russia but that people felt
that they weren't free to move

356
00:30:23,62 --> 00:30:26,11
and now if they try to move.

357
00:30:27,20 --> 00:30:30,37
They're not free to movie there
because germany and france

358
00:30:30,37 --> 00:30:34,32
and all those countries know how many
people would like to move at least very

359
00:30:34,32 --> 00:30:39,97
economic reasons and they don't want that
many slaves coming into western europe.

360
00:30:40,76 --> 00:30:46,28
But the sense of being not free to move
is not just a question of physical

361
00:30:46,28 --> 00:30:46,93
restrictions.

362
00:30:47,14 --> 00:30:55,99
It's also largely an economic
question is your theory.

363
00:30:56,01 --> 00:31:01,38
Not. Not having.

364
00:31:02,36 --> 00:31:08,94
Yes. And not not having learnt.

365
00:31:08,96 --> 00:31:13,57
Yeah. Yeah i realize that you.

366
00:31:14,29 --> 00:31:15,13
I suppose part of

367
00:31:15,13 --> 00:31:21,33
that poverty headspace
is a whole suggestion

368
00:31:21,33 --> 00:31:26,21
that money is inherently evil that.

369
00:31:27,30 --> 00:31:30,28
Worrying about it or
making it or getting it.
