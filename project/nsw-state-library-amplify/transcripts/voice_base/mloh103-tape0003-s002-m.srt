1
00:00:14,38 --> 00:00:16,73
Yet that the deep ecology idea

2
00:00:16,73 --> 00:00:21,45
that we're just part of the fabric of
life with every other living thing and

3
00:00:21,46 --> 00:00:24,80
that the despair we feel for the future
of the planet is the despair of all life

4
00:00:24,80 --> 00:00:30,41
forms on the earth. So the ritual
involves expressing that the spear.

5
00:00:30,43 --> 00:00:35,24
And then. Creating a.

6
00:00:35,25 --> 00:00:37,46
Selecting an item of
landscape of a species

7
00:00:37,46 --> 00:00:41,39
or something to represent in the council
of all beings and then you make a mask

8
00:00:41,39 --> 00:00:46,06
and then you come to the council as
that creature or item a landscape

9
00:00:46,06 --> 00:00:52,17
and you find voice to speak for it.
And this is a very powerful ritual.

10
00:00:53,14 --> 00:00:59,02
It's a very powerful bonding experience
for people who are involved in rainforest

11
00:00:59,02 --> 00:01:00,74
action or you know action
for the environment

12
00:01:01,65 --> 00:01:05,65
and it's also very powerful at giving
people voice who they they find the

13
00:01:05,65 --> 00:01:08,47
confidence and the voice to speak
what they really are concerned about.

14
00:01:10,67 --> 00:01:16,82
So this this particular ritual. Is.

15
00:01:17,73 --> 00:01:19,96
Kind of central to the work
that john seeds been doing

16
00:01:19,96 --> 00:01:22,03
and the rainforest information centre

17
00:01:22,78 --> 00:01:28,69
and the rainforest action groups around
australia who are defending the environment

18
00:01:28,69 --> 00:01:32,51
the people who have committed their
lives to being on the frontline for the

19
00:01:32,51 --> 00:01:37,33
environment. And only possible.

20
00:01:37,35 --> 00:01:38,24
In this area

21
00:01:39,01 --> 00:01:42,19
that it was born here because there were
a sufficient concentration of people

22
00:01:42,19 --> 00:01:45,46
committed to developing
these works in their life.

23
00:01:46,95 --> 00:01:51,90
So later manifestation or
current is conflict resolution

24
00:01:51,91 --> 00:01:56,54
and negotiation skills of become a
major currency up here and people.

25
00:01:56,56 --> 00:02:02,71
Than the new settlers in this area do this
very well. And it's taken the shape of.

26
00:02:03,58 --> 00:02:07,96
An annual conference call the hut politics
conference where social activists come

27
00:02:07,96 --> 00:02:13,01
together and discuss what's
been happening in their lives.

28
00:02:13,19 --> 00:02:15,74
You know particularly if they've
been the spare and burn out

29
00:02:15,74 --> 00:02:17,78
and take you hard find you.

30
00:02:17,80 --> 00:02:18,65
Hard working together

31
00:02:19,36 --> 00:02:23,09
and talk about techniques of
creating nonviolent social action.

32
00:02:24,12 --> 00:02:26,86
The challenge is an enormous
big changes are coming in.

33
00:02:26,86 --> 00:02:29,87
Big changes are going to
be made how to do this.

34
00:02:29,90 --> 00:02:31,92
Non-violently how to create a safe.

35
00:02:32,28 --> 00:02:37,06
Compassionate and culturally rich
community is the challenge of the times

36
00:02:37,06 --> 00:02:41,63
and i see it happening here all the
time i worked in melbourne and sydney.

37
00:02:41,95 --> 00:02:42,89
I did not see it.

38
00:02:42,99 --> 00:02:46,07
I didn't see it expressing itself in
community the way i see it happening on the

39
00:02:46,07 --> 00:02:46,39
north coast.

40
00:02:48,28 --> 00:02:58,56
What about.

41
00:02:58,58 --> 00:03:01,81
Forever and forever.

42
00:03:02,66 --> 00:03:05,92
Well not all the turnings of the.

43
00:03:05,94 --> 00:03:11,74
Not all parts of the aquarius dreams
for professions purposes fruit.

44
00:03:11,88 --> 00:03:16,83
You know. Some of the fruit
turn sour on us and.

45
00:03:17,57 --> 00:03:19,89
One of the observations i have about the.

46
00:03:20,70 --> 00:03:23,40
The drug scene was that it was
part of the aquarius dream

47
00:03:23,40 --> 00:03:25,90
that drugs were a liberation.

48
00:03:26,17 --> 00:03:33,08
We were greatly influenced
by timothy leary huxley

49
00:03:33,09 --> 00:03:35,82
stuff about doorways to perception
they would open your mind.

50
00:03:35,84 --> 00:03:39,47
We're about expanded awareness
and i'm quite clear

51
00:03:39,47 --> 00:03:43,01
that the aquarius festival wouldn't
have happened without the influence of

52
00:03:43,01 --> 00:03:46,33
marijuana and allusions i mean that
was one of the cultural stimulants

53
00:03:46,33 --> 00:03:50,29
that opened our minds to alternatives.

54
00:03:50,31 --> 00:03:56,75
But when it was combined with
the necessities of economics.

55
00:03:56,77 --> 00:03:59,96
And in the problem of never.

56
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,06
Not being able to have a gate

57
00:04:02,06 --> 00:04:05,21
and discriminating about the
people who were coming in

58
00:04:05,21 --> 00:04:08,78
and camping i know i'm a
strong enough to say no.

59
00:04:10,73 --> 00:04:15,28
We had a number of things happening. You
know we can look back on it and say that.

60
00:04:17,10 --> 00:04:21,97
Marijuana as a community sacrament
has a lot of downsides.

61
00:04:22,71 --> 00:04:25,63
We can say well what happened was that.

62
00:04:26,61 --> 00:04:28,26
People smoke a lot of marijuana
they grew it themselves.

63
00:04:28,76 --> 00:04:32,15
So it was always readily available
a lot of people blew their minds

64
00:04:32,15 --> 00:04:35,99
that way with marijuana because
it got stronger and stronger.

65
00:04:36,27 --> 00:04:41,53
I mean they were doing selective
breeding and testing at themselves.

66
00:04:41,55 --> 00:04:44,33
It results in a lot of
lethargy in the community.

67
00:04:44,38 --> 00:04:48,05
We have a lot of people who have ideas
about how things ought to happen

68
00:04:48,05 --> 00:04:52,12
but very little action very little people.
Able to actually bring it all together.

69
00:04:52,39 --> 00:04:52,94
Sit down

70
00:04:52,94 --> 00:04:57,49
and make have a meeting that's clear enough
to make agreements marijuana does not

71
00:04:57,49 --> 00:04:59,37
assist meetings.

72
00:05:00,15 --> 00:05:02,87
A lot of the early troubles we have with
meetings was that people were stunned

73
00:05:02,87 --> 00:05:06,48
when they came to them they weren't
responsible for what they were saying they

74
00:05:06,49 --> 00:05:07,29
unloaded stuff

75
00:05:07,29 --> 00:05:11,07
and they couldn't hear marijuana stops
people from hearing what other people have

76
00:05:11,07 --> 00:05:17,50
got to say. And then there was the
market side of marijuana that.

77
00:05:17,52 --> 00:05:20,43
The good thing about it was that
it provided a means of income

78
00:05:20,43 --> 00:05:22,74
and to build lots of houses in
the state area there are a lot.

79
00:05:22,79 --> 00:05:24,06
Grass castles in this.

80
00:05:24,46 --> 00:05:27,40
Truth of it provided people with income

81
00:05:27,40 --> 00:05:29,84
and allowed them to lift
themselves out of poverty

82
00:05:29,84 --> 00:05:32,69
and improve the conditions of the
family but the other side of

83
00:05:32,69 --> 00:05:39,14
that was it introduced the
nullity people got easy money

84
00:05:39,14 --> 00:05:43,62
and so they dismissed the
idealism of the query

85
00:05:43,62 --> 00:05:47,13
and dreams as irrelevant what the real
world is about is making money mate

86
00:05:48,42 --> 00:05:50,83
and doing deals and being
smart about the drug deals.

87
00:05:50,92 --> 00:05:53,54
So we had a what's called the deal ocracy

88
00:05:53,54 --> 00:05:56,74
that people who are smart at selling
drugs thought themselves to be superior

89
00:05:56,74 --> 00:05:58,70
and apart from what was
going else was going on.

90
00:06:00,56 --> 00:06:06,81
There's associate that with this fear and
paranoia. None of these things make.

91
00:06:07,54 --> 00:06:09,26
For community safe community.

92
00:06:10,89 --> 00:06:15,57
So in the old days you know you should be
able to grow your marijuana garden patch

93
00:06:15,57 --> 00:06:16,37
and that be safe.

94
00:06:16,45 --> 00:06:20,39
Not now people have been known to been
busted people coming in with guns

95
00:06:20,39 --> 00:06:22,38
and stealing marijuana patches

96
00:06:22,38 --> 00:06:27,59
and was kind stuff whole
communities fallen apart because.

97
00:06:27,61 --> 00:06:30,42
The growers a fortnight for amongst
themselves on the community

98
00:06:30,42 --> 00:06:31,89
and had such a siege mentality.

99
00:06:32,47 --> 00:06:34,76
They didn't want visitors
what this you know

100
00:06:34,76 --> 00:06:36,89
that the community ceased
to work as a community.

101
00:06:37,04 --> 00:06:39,10
It was just a drug growing cooperative.

102
00:06:40,15 --> 00:06:41,64
So there are lots of downsides

103
00:06:41,64 --> 00:06:47,21
and then we had the problem
of women being too open.

104
00:06:47,23 --> 00:06:52,01
So that during the 80s
when they grow government

105
00:06:52,01 --> 00:06:54,99
and governments around australia
began closing down mental hospitals

106
00:06:54,99 --> 00:06:58,33
and putting patients on the road and same
community should like look after them.

107
00:06:58,35 --> 00:06:59,48
The family should look after them.

108
00:07:00,69 --> 00:07:04,98
What we got was a policeman all round
australia saying want to go to nimbin.

109
00:07:05,58 --> 00:07:11,67
And women being inundated with
the walking wounded. And.

110
00:07:11,68 --> 00:07:13,46
How can i say the addicted.

111
00:07:15,17 --> 00:07:17,55
I remember in the late 70s

112
00:07:17,55 --> 00:07:22,68
and a group of 16 year old alcoholics from
the western suburbs as nimbin descended

113
00:07:22,68 --> 00:07:27,72
on them then. And expected
to be looked after.

114
00:07:29,64 --> 00:07:36,52
I remember in the late mirror in the
late eighties the late 70s a group of

115
00:07:37,35 --> 00:07:41,91
16 year old 70 year old alcoholics from the
western suburbs of sydney descended on

116
00:07:41,91 --> 00:07:46,42
nimbin and want to believe
that this was the new age

117
00:07:46,42 --> 00:07:50,26
and the new age would look
after people like that

118
00:07:50,26 --> 00:07:53,70
and it would tolerate their behaviour
and their behaviour was disgusting.

119
00:07:54,90 --> 00:08:01,01
They were drunk most of the
time. An abusive. Richard lee.

120
00:08:02,36 --> 00:08:04,05
Dissolute. And proud of it.

121
00:08:05,35 --> 00:08:08,10
They saw themselves as being new-age
punks who are there to shock.

122
00:08:09,09 --> 00:08:13,49
We old aquarians into a
new sense of reality.

123
00:08:14,43 --> 00:08:16,37
And they did we were shocked.

124
00:08:16,56 --> 00:08:19,16
We reported but were unable
to do anything about it and

125
00:08:19,16 --> 00:08:20,42
that became the model for people

126
00:08:20,42 --> 00:08:26,15
that followed i mean one of these guys is
dead now another one's on a mad pension

127
00:08:26,15 --> 00:08:30,15
blew his brains. These were desperate
cases people who wanted to be dead.

128
00:08:30,20 --> 00:08:31,46
This is total neil ism.

129
00:08:31,52 --> 00:08:32,20
We're talking about the future

130
00:08:32,90 --> 00:08:37,92
and suddenly we had to deal with neil us
who had no future and on top of that.

131
00:08:38,05 --> 00:08:44,67
There you know the rejects the walking
wounded who arrived in town from.

132
00:08:44,69 --> 00:08:48,24
Closed mental hospitals who expected
to be look after looked after.

133
00:08:49,41 --> 00:08:55,35
I remember there was the case of a. Torrent
strait islander who came to the town.

134
00:08:56,58 --> 00:08:59,33
And he was very black.

135
00:09:01,33 --> 00:09:05,48
He was about five foot four tall and
five foot four across the shoulders and

136
00:09:05,49 --> 00:09:09,94
when he got some alcohol in
him he was angry and violent.

137
00:09:11,03 --> 00:09:12,36
He was looked after by the community.

138
00:09:12,67 --> 00:09:17,84
He was fed for free in rainbow cafe and
asked to do some chores just sweep

139
00:09:17,84 --> 00:09:19,30
and they would happily contribute to

140
00:09:19,30 --> 00:09:23,28
that he was a you know sober he was a
really nice guy to talk to the community.

141
00:09:23,33 --> 00:09:27,06
But when drunk he put his fist through
the plate glass window of the roma cafe

142
00:09:27,06 --> 00:09:31,29
when that and another occasion
he raped two women and one night

143
00:09:31,29 --> 00:09:32,37
and it kind of all falls

144
00:09:33,50 --> 00:09:39,91
and the next day you sleeping off his
alcoholic father in the tomato sauce

145
00:09:40,76 --> 00:09:41,79
and.

146
00:09:41,81 --> 00:09:48,65
Some guys came into town from town who
falls approached the tomato sauce

147
00:09:48,65 --> 00:09:50,03
put balaclavas on their face

148
00:09:50,03 --> 00:09:55,66
and pulled out some four before for
me to from underneath their coats

149
00:09:55,67 --> 00:09:59,79
and beat the guy up beating about the legs
to learn no it wasn't on this is bad.

150
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:00,20
News

151
00:10:00,20 --> 00:10:06,01
when you community has been giuliani's
what other expression was there i heard

152
00:10:06,01 --> 00:10:08,78
that this guy left town.

153
00:10:08,88 --> 00:10:11,41
Shortly after that he did
get the message and i heard

154
00:10:11,41 --> 00:10:13,42
that he was one of the
deaths in custody and

155
00:10:15,01 --> 00:10:16,75
that was like it was
like the situation was.

156
00:10:16,84 --> 00:10:19,22
If you can't survive in the man
you can't survive anywhere.

157
00:10:19,35 --> 00:10:23,06
You know more compassion more tolerance
in the other community i've been to

158
00:10:23,06 --> 00:10:24,95
and it was much lee abused.

159
00:10:26,31 --> 00:10:31,57
So what's happened more recently
is like the street drug scene

160
00:10:33,33 --> 00:10:38,67
had got very. It's being attended to. Now
but for a while there it got very bad.

161
00:10:38,69 --> 00:10:39,77
Smack moved in.

162
00:10:40,77 --> 00:10:42,98
I couldn't imagine that
smack would come to them

163
00:10:42,98 --> 00:10:48,53
and we always thought in the 70s that
it required more money than that

164
00:10:48,53 --> 00:10:52,48
but of course marijuana generated its
own income and its own drug trade.

165
00:10:52,59 --> 00:10:59,49
So there was an exchange people would bring
back smack exchange for marijuana and.

166
00:11:00,65 --> 00:11:05,59
Nimbin became a holiday
resort for junkies road.

167
00:11:05,82 --> 00:11:09,51
If you're living on the back streets of
you know fitzroy and you had a habit.

168
00:11:09,67 --> 00:11:13,24
You heard about this wonderful place we can
get any drug you want within 10 minutes

169
00:11:13,24 --> 00:11:16,44
and why not go for a holiday
and him and so them

170
00:11:16,45 --> 00:11:22,47
and developed its own hard
drug scene. And this.

171
00:11:23,82 --> 00:11:27,89
This makes in another sense is like niman
being a prophetic community it's only

172
00:11:27,89 --> 00:11:30,38
acting out what's happening
in other other cities

173
00:11:30,38 --> 00:11:33,13
but doing much more blatantly a much
more up front than anywhere else.

174
00:11:33,43 --> 00:11:36,44
It's true but niman only
has one main street

175
00:11:36,44 --> 00:11:41,37
and this maxine is right smack in the
middle of it and visitors coming to them

176
00:11:41,37 --> 00:11:44,06
and don't see the new age optimism
the rainbow power company.

177
00:11:44,09 --> 00:11:49,43
What they see is whacked out people.
No light in their eyes at all.

178
00:11:49,53 --> 00:11:55,63
No optimism no future.
And it's kind of got.

179
00:11:56,37 --> 00:11:59,58
Institutionalized. You know
like there's sufficient.

180
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:01,67
Some traction to have its own mores

181
00:12:01,67 --> 00:12:05,70
and its own defense not easily
moved not easily hidden

182
00:12:07,54 --> 00:12:08,84
and.

183
00:12:08,86 --> 00:12:15,13
Not a great advertisement for any means.

184
00:12:17,06 --> 00:12:21,04
No more sense of failure and then when
any community trying to deal with.

185
00:12:22,58 --> 00:12:28,63
The effect of drugs and i like. I agree
with what what i said about this.

186
00:12:28,78 --> 00:12:31,60
The problem is the law
probably creates the problem.

187
00:12:32,86 --> 00:12:37,75
If marijuana and heroin
were available legally and

188
00:12:37,75 --> 00:12:39,86
and controlled in the same way as.

189
00:12:40,14 --> 00:12:41,36
The spy of alcohol and cigarettes

190
00:12:41,36 --> 00:12:45,92
and nicotine as controlled we wouldn't
have the markets duration we wouldn't have

191
00:12:45,92 --> 00:12:49,69
the economy that supports the scene and.

192
00:12:50,68 --> 00:12:53,14
All the downside of it would
be removed it can be treated.

193
00:12:53,33 --> 00:12:55,16
They could be addressed
as a community problem.

194
00:12:55,25 --> 00:13:01,51
But while we have a covert there's no way
you can bring the forces of light onto it.

195
00:13:01,59 --> 00:13:05,76
You know like you can't
have active programs.

196
00:13:05,78 --> 00:13:09,42
You can't create a community.

197
00:13:09,44 --> 00:13:14,25
Rehabilitation program that's going to
work because they the culture of the

198
00:13:14,25 --> 00:13:18,21
addiction is self-supporting. You know.

199
00:13:18,23 --> 00:13:22,36
Anyway it's a nutty problem
but i've got more hope name

200
00:13:22,36 --> 00:13:24,26
and i'll do something creative
about it than anywhere else

201
00:13:24,26 --> 00:13:26,68
but it's like it's one of the things

202
00:13:27,61 --> 00:13:30,79
that nieman inherit it from aquarius
it has its dark side shadow side.

203
00:13:32,07 --> 00:13:38,03
And talking of shadows. And we talk
about this other aspect of name and.

204
00:13:38,05 --> 00:13:41,88
That. When we're organising
the queries festival.

205
00:13:42,17 --> 00:13:43,12
We heard this rumour

206
00:13:43,12 --> 00:13:45,95
that was coming from the aboriginal
community in melbourne of all places

207
00:13:46,93 --> 00:13:49,61
that nimbin had a curse upon it.

208
00:13:49,63 --> 00:13:53,97
It was the valley you'd been curst they
said that they've been a massacre there

209
00:13:56,12 --> 00:14:01,23
and. A cursed been put on by the aboriginal
people that now. What ever prosper.

210
00:14:02,94 --> 00:14:07,83
That happened at valley until
somehow the curse was lifted.

211
00:14:07,85 --> 00:14:09,99
So i was really interested
to find out about this.

212
00:14:10,03 --> 00:14:16,42
That was part of the mythmaking of
the festival. And i went chasing.

213
00:14:17,91 --> 00:14:20,99
Aboriginal leaders in the area searching
them out to find out what they knew about

214
00:14:20,99 --> 00:14:27,12
it and i came to nothing.
You know i met uncle lyle.

215
00:14:27,14 --> 00:14:30,29
And who was an aboriginal
elder at the time.

216
00:14:31,22 --> 00:14:34,07
And he knew nothing about or if he did
he wasn't willing to talk about it

217
00:14:34,07 --> 00:14:36,84
but the words that were said were

218
00:14:36,84 --> 00:14:43,36
when i asking about spiritual issues
what i got back were christian. Words.

219
00:14:43,54 --> 00:14:47,82
So i my feeling was a bunch of people
have been so effectively christianized

220
00:14:47,82 --> 00:14:52,14
that they did not know the story anymore.
If it wasn't immediately available.

221
00:14:53,68 --> 00:14:56,69
So we went into the festival
with that hanging over us

222
00:14:56,69 --> 00:15:02,99
and a couple of years in about 1977 i
had an opportunity to visit kath walker

223
00:15:02,99 --> 00:15:05,21
stradbroke island.

224
00:15:05,23 --> 00:15:09,71
And it was had a remarkable night
with catherine and her campfire.

225
00:15:09,97 --> 00:15:15,12
Which she showed us some of her
shaman abilities shaman powers

226
00:15:15,81 --> 00:15:18,92
and of poetry and the madness of all
that counts that one of those nights

227
00:15:19,96 --> 00:15:22,58
and in the course i told her the story
of nim and what was happening there

228
00:15:22,58 --> 00:15:25,10
and she expressed interest
in finding out more

229
00:15:25,10 --> 00:15:27,70
and i was interested to find
out the aboriginal story.

230
00:15:28,96 --> 00:15:33,11
So i invited catwalk to come to nimbin
and stay with us for a while and he did

231
00:15:33,11 --> 00:15:37,15
and she stayed with a friend at the
end of a weeks day i went to see her

232
00:15:37,93 --> 00:15:43,36
and i say well what do you think
what you know and she said that.

233
00:15:44,62 --> 00:15:46,65
She was feeling worse

234
00:15:46,65 --> 00:15:52,10
that newman was male initiation
ground very strong country.

235
00:15:52,12 --> 00:15:53,95
That this is not good for women.

236
00:15:54,01 --> 00:15:59,69
So it's not a place where
women are going to prosper.

237
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,02
So take that into account and the other
thing. I think about it is that.

238
00:16:05,04 --> 00:16:08,84
It's a place where people come to learn.

239
00:16:10,31 --> 00:16:13,78
Young men coming for initiation
and if you stay too long.

240
00:16:14,03 --> 00:16:17,84
You don't get the initiation if
you don't learn and move on.

241
00:16:17,98 --> 00:16:19,82
Then you'll turn to stone.

242
00:16:21,26 --> 00:16:24,81
That the rocks will take the energy
back they take the teaching back

243
00:16:24,81 --> 00:16:29,33
and you'll be become rigid and.

244
00:16:29,35 --> 00:16:35,06
I got this message in 1977 the
battle of trainee creek was 1978

245
00:16:35,06 --> 00:16:41,10
and i was like i felt developed only greek
for me was like as much as i could do in

246
00:16:41,10 --> 00:16:45,61
community organization. I mean i got what
i wanted the community was strong enough.

247
00:16:46,87 --> 00:16:48,57
You know it was working as a community

248
00:16:48,57 --> 00:16:55,31
and i did fictive leave been marginalized
by my radical stand on the forest fight

249
00:16:55,31 --> 00:16:55,77
so

250
00:16:55,77 --> 00:17:00,00
that any time i try to do anything you know
i had a chorus of voices saying shut up.

251
00:17:00,14 --> 00:17:05,57
Stop. Don't do anything more
you caused me much trouble.

252
00:17:05,58 --> 00:17:10,73
I began to realize that my initiation
was oprah's time for me to move on.

253
00:17:11,70 --> 00:17:17,74
So those words had a personal meaning
for me but i also observe them in them

254
00:17:17,74 --> 00:17:18,78
but.

255
00:17:18,80 --> 00:17:19,36
They say

256
00:17:20,19 --> 00:17:24,29
that part of the drug problem in yemen is
young people because the drug market the

257
00:17:24,29 --> 00:17:25,54
drug dealers in the middle.

258
00:17:25,56 --> 00:17:32,49
Usually in typically people selling drugs
to tourist typically 100 18 year olds

259
00:17:32,49 --> 00:17:36,49
who lack appropriate initiation.

260
00:17:36,65 --> 00:17:39,75
They're part of the man
who is off the rails

261
00:17:41,19 --> 00:17:47,26
and it needs stronger initiation to bring
them in line also is that when you.

262
00:17:48,41 --> 00:17:51,81
If this is 40 thousand years old
this wisdom about this country

263
00:17:52,58 --> 00:17:54,31
and if you ignore it. You
do so at your peril.

264
00:17:54,64 --> 00:17:58,44
And it's as if if you muck
around with that kind of energy.

265
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,98
It has its own entity a.d.

266
00:18:01,98 --> 00:18:07,49
You know so what was was a positive thing
for learning turns in on itself and.

267
00:18:07,50 --> 00:18:09,08
In the shadows reveal themselves.

268
00:18:10,44 --> 00:18:13,96
So you know the sense that
there's an image as a metaphor

269
00:18:13,96 --> 00:18:20,29
when hear about the social problems an
imminent drug problem has been generated

270
00:18:20,29 --> 00:18:24,00
being the shadow of the aquarian dream.

271
00:18:24,01 --> 00:18:29,79
Because somehow the land is being abused
somehow not enough respect is being taken

272
00:18:29,79 --> 00:18:34,86
the energy that that
valley inherently has. So.

273
00:18:36,94 --> 00:18:42,83
Name and it's my. Mother
joy mother of despair.

274
00:18:43,58 --> 00:18:47,14
It broke my heart broken open.

275
00:18:48,11 --> 00:18:55,51
And.
