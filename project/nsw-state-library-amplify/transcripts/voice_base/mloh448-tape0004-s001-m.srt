1
00:00:01,74 --> 00:00:05,61
Yes I was sitting at the next table in my head.

2
00:00:05,61 --> 00:00:15,36
It was just the sun coming out of those are our child and he said to his friend a ferry boat.

3
00:00:15,45 --> 00:00:22,8
She said with friends is years old a little over a single trip.

4
00:00:22,93 --> 00:00:28,15
They're looking for we're not this is always something like something our son Will

5
00:00:28,15 --> 00:00:37,58
and well at first it was a full minute on this was to be you know just so much with you he said to have come with us.

6
00:00:37,99 --> 00:00:45,75
And when I used to fire you if you didn't come with a run through with my elderly

7
00:00:45,75 --> 00:00:57,79
or sexual man he is not generally found that would hold my life up to a very kind of the point in your head to release

8
00:00:57,79 --> 00:01:07,00
I never push for a very long story. The thing. Fair enough but that you did it was wrong.

9
00:01:07,12 --> 00:01:11,86
Yesterday you told us it was doing.

10
00:01:11,91 --> 00:01:18,58
The real real shocking arrest the very difficult for people to visit the very person.

11
00:01:18,75 --> 00:01:28,7
You see I've often told result if I were I Die Hard hit the sexual how I would feel secure.

12
00:01:28,96 --> 00:01:38,42
You don't think a memory a memory of some sort of relationship your life with both I think I possess a very shiny for

13
00:01:38,42 --> 00:01:38,63
life.

14
00:01:38,72 --> 00:01:45,4
I think a lot of his followers are good for me and I think they're there and they are very revealing the is the sure

15
00:01:45,4 --> 00:01:53,47
but the getting to that I mean regardless of whether or not.

16
00:01:53,58 --> 00:02:01,17
How widespread it was stated that if you actually told somebody that he or she did. Yes I would like to list.

17
00:02:01,69 --> 00:02:09,47
Just not entirely. We were talking about the routing market using the route that was in the dish you know.

18
00:02:09,74 --> 00:02:11,09
Probably the LATE EDITION. It's amazing.

19
00:02:11,5 --> 00:02:14,35
These are listed here we're in the forty's

20
00:02:14,35 --> 00:02:27,32
and there's certainly the like a part of this is you know it was never said so what was your day challenge to say that

21
00:02:27,32 --> 00:02:36,82
I mean have you been a lot of discussion about what people are more aware of

22
00:02:36,82 --> 00:02:42,55
and among intelligent people who live with your sister. Now this is interesting.

23
00:02:42,67 --> 00:02:50,34
I don't know because as I said my rendition of I'm a writer mystery which characters reckons stepbrother's sort of

24
00:02:50,34 --> 00:02:55,74
sympathetic enough there right now.

25
00:02:56,17 --> 00:03:06,76
That was a change of attitude to write it was a career a bit of all that it was at the wrong house to be a shot that

26
00:03:06,76 --> 00:03:08,00
really makes everything

27
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:20,3
but why the change came about the sun will live just a couple in the series in the was a lot of stuff in the early

28
00:03:20,3 --> 00:03:26,9
fifty's basically because of the events leading up to the establishment of will from the committee hearing already.

29
00:03:27,11 --> 00:03:30,58
That is the whole world should leave you very much.

30
00:03:30,79 --> 00:03:37,07
Yes to that for us to get everybody to really be guesses on the over the report came at a time

31
00:03:37,07 --> 00:03:45,11
when there was a certain easing of people's feelings for him so that things anyway in other words I really feel for you

32
00:03:45,11 --> 00:03:45,48
here.

33
00:03:45,55 --> 00:03:47,19
You say well then again

34
00:03:47,19 --> 00:03:55,35
when I see the next thing back before that is Kinsey Well maybe they're just sad that maybe I didn't then your it was

35
00:03:55,35 --> 00:03:59,67
right here is about right now this is I read about it in the local.

36
00:04:03,7 --> 00:04:09,74
So I would say that that perspective because we have heard that

37
00:04:09,74 --> 00:04:15,2
and I have a good there are a lot of talk of very effective this discussion here

38
00:04:15,31 --> 00:04:19,57
and it was out in the air that the one with the felt isolated that anybody

39
00:04:19,79 --> 00:04:23,57
and he said organizational Manvers Naresh nurturing a little bit.

40
00:04:23,6 --> 00:04:26,91
Are you actually get to realize it out

41
00:04:26,91 --> 00:04:36,29
and have people are sharing you know he's saying that he's for it wasn't just for the dummies segment cancer was the

42
00:04:36,29 --> 00:04:38,28
movement of overcoming all the other woman

43
00:04:38,28 --> 00:04:48,88
or all the natural right to not trying to mix with people all the auctioneer that Michel.

44
00:04:48,9 --> 00:04:59,43
You know the theory that some people of the business that they said this is the second rule was such a lot of people

45
00:04:59,43 --> 00:05:00,27
just got here.

46
00:05:00,43 --> 00:05:07,78
You know experienced on the same homosexual sex yet at least in the Rose of The End of years in a way in which they

47
00:05:07,78 --> 00:05:10,64
might head to the same place kids.

48
00:05:10,77 --> 00:05:11,41
Yes

49
00:05:11,41 --> 00:05:20,31
but the whole message explosion of carry over their own attitudes to say here here should be possible to look down on

50
00:05:20,31 --> 00:05:26,41
the leg and I mean telling people there's always been a reasonably thought well there's been a lot of discussion

51
00:05:26,41 --> 00:05:31,33
but I mean you sort of think the price drop you know this is a much wider thing.

52
00:05:31,42 --> 00:05:39,05
I mean obviously this is just such a good back into the nineteenth century people like Karl Rove Look at us the whole

53
00:05:39,05 --> 00:05:44,37
story while troubling there's a whole group of people there.

54
00:05:44,51 --> 00:05:53,82
That's really the central Reform League which is the thing that one study here will bear that Mr President.

55
00:05:54,15 --> 00:06:01,2
So rosy should he says it really hurt that this because that only hands like this young is missing with a.

56
00:06:01,54 --> 00:06:12,07
The US is also circles and people were people would always swoop in on one and one openly

57
00:06:12,07 --> 00:06:15,21
and discuss it about people's sexuality

58
00:06:15,87 --> 00:06:26,76
and says he will receive this was discussed among heterosexuals among the overweight or rather the words custody.

59
00:06:26,94 --> 00:06:29,82
Even among the execs will be in need my company.

60
00:06:29,89 --> 00:06:39,05
Here is where the I would play or big whatever doesn't matter but I said listen the in conversations of ahead

61
00:06:39,52 --> 00:06:42,95
and the conversations that I used to hear market research shows

62
00:06:42,95 --> 00:06:48,83
or example then has issues to get about people's sexuality

63
00:06:48,83 --> 00:06:54,79
and people will say the reason that it was about I am here

64
00:06:54,92 --> 00:07:02,65
and then your question here is never assume that we will say that last night we had a sexual bit of it

65
00:07:02,65 --> 00:07:12,65
and it would always be about usually about the man and that's Elmo my grade for me and the general feeling I got

66
00:07:12,65 --> 00:07:19,1
when you're let's just it was was all of a feeling of said the you know let's just watch.

67
00:07:19,56 --> 00:07:29,61
Is that what I ask you receive no I don't really think the brothers talking about something much was either trucks

68
00:07:29,61 --> 00:07:36,76
or medical career people you're a way you will get a higher degree accept reality than you do in the normal run you got

69
00:07:36,76 --> 00:07:42,28
ahold of the people whose problem lies talked about me here and you know what I think even in that group.

70
00:07:42,44 --> 00:07:45,19
I think a lot of them are saying you know this and that

71
00:07:45,19 --> 00:07:52,29
when basically all this because I think it's a smart thing to do and it did it was done.

72
00:07:52,4 --> 00:08:04,12
Oh I live hospitals or do you want to really go over. You know your fifty's. OK. The scene for us here.

73
00:08:04,36 --> 00:08:16,01
And those who love the machines if you will are under the bed to let you get out of the parking lots I'll tell you what

74
00:08:16,17 --> 00:08:23,72
I was at a party once where the woman in the play straight in there about Trinity all those lines around listening to

75
00:08:23,72 --> 00:08:24,53
records.

76
00:08:24,56 --> 00:08:30,13
It looked like this it was about the time it created it spoke

77
00:08:30,35 --> 00:08:35,52
and the we were like the right really truly five of us lie run just me.

78
00:08:35,71 --> 00:08:44,84
Rachel as we were doing it so subdued lighting and because there was living in the flat.

79
00:08:45,04 --> 00:08:55,13
The only one without holes on the flat nor was I then the owner a friend of the other came in with police.

80
00:08:55,94 --> 00:08:56,84
He had a cake.

81
00:08:57,42 --> 00:08:58,13
Just walked in

82
00:08:59,87 --> 00:09:09,1
and what I saw were these twenty twenty five thirty people lying around this fairly large living area listening to

83
00:09:09,1 --> 00:09:09,92
records.

84
00:09:09,95 --> 00:09:11,75
Nobody was hoping it was his

85
00:09:11,75 --> 00:09:20,68
or clearly labeled because he was doing anything you'll watch over the class of listening to even classical

86
00:09:22,61 --> 00:09:28,66
and the it's quite obvious who it was good because police didn't do a really good reforms that ever lived.

87
00:09:29,05 --> 00:09:36,53
But the way you love the labels and we all just took stock of this exact regime of free will.

88
00:09:36,7 --> 00:09:45,12
People who were three of what police and one of the policemen said was right

89
00:09:45,12 --> 00:09:51,74
and the other one said like the protest privately and then another was said Jay Z.

90
00:09:51,74 --> 00:09:56,25
Said to think of it is this black stuff and career right now.

91
00:09:56,28 --> 00:10:01,00
No I didn't go out from the race blacks who are doing you know.

92
00:10:02,42 --> 00:10:10,03
There's language around like cross-examining everyone else that night is what I did their occupations rather over a

93
00:10:10,03 --> 00:10:22,56
Republican crisis those are architects. Doctors of accountants and that's what they and those oh are you.

94
00:10:23,13 --> 00:10:32,2
I know you give it up for the site but the words are those that say what you mean your shirt sexual. I love you.

95
00:10:32,94 --> 00:10:33,63
I don't know that side.

96
00:10:33,69 --> 00:10:44,08
Well you're not mad I said this should be hoping that this is not a very direct result of was what you are you are

97
00:10:44,08 --> 00:10:45,59
whether or not. Man it's impossible.

98
00:10:45,94 --> 00:10:53,81
Crystal clear and I quote and he said no we're only talking to us because of the results of the fluff.

99
00:10:53,91 --> 00:11:04,26
But they were getting a response from the presumed one they want to respond stark yes you are taking up the out six

100
00:11:04,26 --> 00:11:07,09
times last night he hit me on you get this story

101
00:11:07,09 --> 00:11:13,95
or should I quote it because that's what I get clothes from would be awesome that they used to lose their house so that

102
00:11:13,95 --> 00:11:20,6
there are enough and I meet someone who makes millions. They can get that rooster over here.

103
00:11:20,69 --> 00:11:29,74
That's why I don't venture less wonder they said things like productive kind of Forestry right now have a medical

104
00:11:29,74 --> 00:11:41,57
examination. There were no houses exhaust on here. You got your car. And it was possible that was the other cocaine.

105
00:11:41,65 --> 00:11:49,01
Well it would have been one of the people who wondered about making these sort remarks was bumped off.

106
00:11:49,21 --> 00:12:01,13
He was online and he was full of us in the store he saw all right he said You wonder what that man was Hayes's must.

107
00:12:01,99 --> 00:12:15,43
Oh the real monster that's well yes well tough but that would leave the beginning of the Korean War. Yeah yeah.

108
00:12:16,15 --> 00:12:22,18
See we you know one of the things you just rules you know. Yeah a lot of you say Green was only love you.

109
00:12:23,28 --> 00:12:34,38
If you watch the time we're going to spoil your solution of finding in Korea where the young lady would be until he was

110
00:12:34,38 --> 00:12:38,14
older he was a police car you can tell. Yeah place Commissioner.

111
00:12:38,26 --> 00:12:43,76
Yeah sure the Catholic Church thought it was just out scene where he got up

114
00:13:08,64 --> 00:13:14,93
Usually yes I hear. He used like police playing in a mirror in the mirror.

115
00:13:15,06 --> 00:13:22,45
We hope truth what are we hearing that really was there behind the girl a little trick for us

116
00:13:22,45 --> 00:13:29,84
and all those who were getting along fine with us here first time ever heard. Rose up or like OK great.

117
00:13:30,06 --> 00:13:36,21
Yes Well this was a this was this was this is a bit like this is this realize oh really.

118
00:13:36,36 --> 00:13:39,69
That this is the this is really.

119
00:13:39,75 --> 00:13:46,01
Here's where this just crossing of the business to supply him with the truth was around here to get us there

120
00:13:46,01 --> 00:13:49,07
but it may break but I usually say that.

121
00:13:49,2 --> 00:13:54,35
Yeah all of us have that Harry said the police writer really like

122
00:13:54,35 --> 00:14:00,59
and works about the place right now the rest of the roster. Oh yeah you get great like very late in bed together.

123
00:14:01,42 --> 00:14:16,86
Just a great place with Priscilla Presley funny enough. Rusty Russell that doesn't cross a line in Russell it up.

124
00:14:18,38 --> 00:14:21,8
Can you really really star was a rogue out there here.

125
00:14:21,83 --> 00:14:29,87
Russell dead already said roughly your yes she would be shortly out to you on this

126
00:14:29,87 --> 00:14:36,75
or night just to get to that part that she used to wear shortly after I teamed up with this route.

127
00:14:37,95 --> 00:14:42,68
We're wondering longer across from now we see these two figures in front of us this is going down.

128
00:14:42,97 --> 00:14:51,24
We see down down the hill from the top of the Cross going down was rough cause by that straight they all left well here

129
00:14:51,24 --> 00:15:01,62
we saw these two people are walking ahead of us a woman and a man and I said to Ralph this is crazy.

130
00:15:01,9 --> 00:15:16,91
He said Just come here and there you know I said Mr Hawkins probably talked to them or something

131
00:15:16,91 --> 00:15:24,69
and you know we got into conversation probably you know he was really serious Why do you got angry that very droll the

132
00:15:24,69 --> 00:15:29,8
yes I used to see a movie ground he's crossed carrying two bottles.

133
00:15:30,16 --> 00:15:38,3
You know bottles up to the both of those are all the over like of this is to get some help here.

134
00:15:38,66 --> 00:15:46,96
We will be back to the place she had the first floor of a barn where she lived for years

135
00:15:46,96 --> 00:15:52,36
and I was absolutely fascinated because Ross who knows how to insult those two players

136
00:15:52,36 --> 00:15:59,04
and drew three million that happened along on the very attractive where the they will too.

137
00:16:01,3 --> 00:16:09,02
To have a pistol just reach the window of this first floor of this resort for any window door sort of thing.

138
00:16:09,05 --> 00:16:12,74
There was the old well window of the top floors.

139
00:16:12,85 --> 00:16:17,45
It wasn't just down onto the ground as facet of this

140
00:16:17,45 --> 00:16:23,86
and then we were going through the end of the bed together rosily Norton got into bed with them and

141
00:16:23,86 --> 00:16:30,66
when we got on the nature of alcohol and Henri years there was no big bowl of little mole

142
00:16:30,66 --> 00:16:38,89
and she talked about going up to the local cemetery to get to give you the operation. I said you made it special.

That's where you are the gracious dribble of pay for the respectable ones paid for.

00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:32,75
or start you get your that we're going to get a lot of the things you think I have about zero point here

158
00:18:32,78 --> 00:18:42,23
and here we have a guy who's very gracious he's a good man would be. She was bisexual. I certainly will last.

159
00:18:43,24 --> 00:18:55,32
And what was recently busted was this book the city had three people who tended to be just by the conventional stand

160
00:18:56,31 --> 00:19:03,23
but I mean one of the things we have to do is pull the whole Bible or at least from the leisure to find out.

161
00:19:03,28 --> 00:19:09,55
Oh you got rid of prosecuting and mother was well are trying to find out I do.

162
00:19:09,58 --> 00:19:18,12
George was doing this for his wrist is well known what George love is yours is now married with three shows already

163
00:19:18,12 --> 00:19:26,62
but now most will be someone that might be worthwhile finding out something about Ross used to work

164
00:19:26,62 --> 00:19:34,56
and leave him alone here was I also was always he was big success

165
00:19:34,56 --> 00:19:44,9
but he did other motivational really rose for Doris but Ross was most certainly for you. Period.

166
00:19:44,94 --> 00:19:58,04
Well done here in the in his life saw there was no question that he didn't tell you the scars that he has boyfriends

167
00:19:58,04 --> 00:20:01,03
Big Bear just trip along the Gulf oil spill. There was.

168
00:20:01,58 --> 00:20:15,55
And we just talked to several others who knows the spread of life and by this.

169
00:20:16,18 --> 00:20:23,24
It was a well it was really does not share that with the wrong things going to get their bikes were rescued Bush budgie

170
00:20:23,24 --> 00:20:25,27
fished a little bit with it.

171
00:20:25,44 --> 00:20:34,59
It must have been an old restaurant we should all be fulfilled as it is to the right or to be fragile but I assure you.

172
00:20:34,81 --> 00:20:35,73
By this which already.

173
00:20:35,78 --> 00:20:44,8
For several years to see that from the first guy eat the guy year nightspot year Go year where because he will not be

174
00:20:45,03 --> 00:20:56,04
life which is like this drawn out legal trade which is now as you say great Shirley slightly from her story

175
00:20:57,31 --> 00:21:00,91
but it sucks really goes from here

176
00:21:01,41 --> 00:21:08,75
but is it true you were a little off a little to the Charlotte area that they are sitting around for you.

177
00:21:08,76 --> 00:21:18,00
Jes year for your city did you know here was a cigar smoking worth of you know what you would find out about drugs

178
00:21:18,00 --> 00:21:23,98
three reactors I said said he was this new in his last start was with white

179
00:21:23,98 --> 00:21:33,6
and startles of this it could really do with those this was a problem to me. Should they lose Kareem bills.

180
00:21:33,78 --> 00:21:41,9
All of those people trained dogs is he really going to quit but the long way.

181
00:21:41,91 --> 00:21:54,38
Here is really very clear Doug is joining us. I do not know anything yet at the literary about it.

182
00:21:54,73 --> 00:22:01,08
Read about the over here where your brother starts off with his mother's.

183
00:22:01,26 --> 00:22:10,62
And more sense because this guy got to know cars that's why he was the one man who was the people

184
00:22:10,62 --> 00:22:15,24
and here it was terribly camp and I'm sure it was really really great actor on there

185
00:22:15,24 --> 00:22:25,57
and he's a lot of cross-bred sexual Rebrov got a lot of knocks right to me

186
00:22:25,88 --> 00:22:33,55
but Marjorie was easy to get out of John Rocker who really was out of her hole with my bet is that you get a are is

187
00:22:33,55 --> 00:22:36,43
pretty but it's a yes so Mark is that pretty

188
00:22:36,43 --> 00:22:45,17
and let's say hey here's the front of Harvey's the first three guns get know those parties for free gallery house that

189
00:22:45,17 --> 00:22:53,13
you go to just south of the city are the only way you get Yeah you're a good track here

190
00:22:53,47 --> 00:22:59,47
and he bought his people again for proof of that we get to keep it longer here

191
00:22:59,47 --> 00:23:10,41
and that's O'Mara says trying it myself but it very ordinary house infiltrate God if it were just a motor sauces

192
00:23:10,75 --> 00:23:17,45
and he'd just have babies everywhere and his bike pretty busy the other companies will be his anyway.

193
00:23:17,93 --> 00:23:24,57
Oh my love him of mine in my mind it had sexual sensual that he would go out

194
00:23:24,98 --> 00:23:35,41
and march less well with He'd have drugs from the pleasure of the old Those that play reasonably well anyway.

195
00:23:36,08 --> 00:23:41,67
And then there's the great Harry officer who is going to get into his head that makes the world

196
00:23:41,67 --> 00:23:47,23
but he was really going strong.

197
00:23:47,72 --> 00:23:57,77
No saying yes I suppose you listened years where you live you just six years and years

198
00:23:57,77 --> 00:24:00,9
and years later record been overseas for a few years ago too.

199
00:24:01,4 --> 00:24:07,42
I would like to know the real Sharon and Princess and they said Oh Maurice legend has it done to you.

200
00:24:08,17 --> 00:24:09,25
Was it not this early on.

201
00:24:09,34 --> 00:24:14,76
Check that out and then I was strangely and sure enough she makes a joke of me

202
00:24:14,76 --> 00:24:18,75
and I am talking made back to his place for coffee.

203
00:24:18,84 --> 00:24:28,2
But then he was living for a little but the richness of the air

204
00:24:28,2 --> 00:24:35,26
but he had to get rid of the junk you start to lose muscle good luck Morris

205
00:24:35,26 --> 00:24:38,5
and a pretty poor particular can do very much

206
00:24:38,5 --> 00:24:47,65
and it hardly startled the force that he gave his visitation of the lives of the year's biggest relief on a good little

207
00:24:47,65 --> 00:24:52,84
narrow good old grandfather image because his history of the force was.

208
00:24:52,97 --> 00:25:03,13
Well yeah it's right religion or rather lose it all and finish all that everybody like to say again

209
00:25:03,13 --> 00:25:20,29
and we never do it in order to give us the big things like a city discard like Lee He said this is a huge rally we'll

210
00:25:20,29 --> 00:25:26,16
give you three weeks here. Yes raises up the skills.

211
00:25:26,29 --> 00:25:35,39
There's a lot of us to host you know fellows good people and they're here where we never of the year.

212
00:25:35,4 --> 00:25:38,4
Look there's a reason to be here

213
00:25:38,4 --> 00:25:50,15
when the good people must be some rich guy with the forty's fifty's who did for our young life

214
00:25:50,15 --> 00:25:54,34
and I think quite often you know there's a right.

215
00:25:54,57 --> 00:26:01,12
There's a right to get across the border around the future here because I'm only here and I take you back.

216
00:26:01,52 --> 00:26:06,44
Right off the list. Let me read that.

217
00:26:06,46 --> 00:26:23,07
I just read through a little poster out there still has a letter today with blood was nearly not believe my life you

218
00:26:23,07 --> 00:26:32,75
listed there you have your letter helps a little not really mum used to get up to this just left with it so it was on

219
00:26:32,75 --> 00:26:55,75
the news and this is what forty's you must look up again because he felt like he was because he was quite still here

220
00:26:55,75 --> 00:26:58,73
and it was a nice guy

221
00:26:58,73 --> 00:27:10,8
and he said Now I think you believe me I was like This is a result I mean all for the movement you feel you always do

222
00:27:10,8 --> 00:27:15,23
does it feel really really low your mind you there was willing to do a little.

223
00:27:15,62 --> 00:27:27,77
Oh I say Oh I've met people who are sorry that was the other Your mother will cease to be a solicitor at some stations

224
00:27:27,77 --> 00:27:31,36
but I was already there.

225
00:27:31,43 --> 00:27:40,11
It was just because he was crazy because you know the real world

226
00:27:40,11 --> 00:27:56,7
or that we're OK let's just say he was he was a doctor he was a scene from really were doctor the whole character was

227
00:27:56,7 --> 00:28:01,15
very rich and he wished.

228
00:28:01,26 --> 00:28:09,89
All sitting down with me and that being with you over which is you know a lot of money and prestige

229
00:28:09,89 --> 00:28:19,95
or a whole lot of the edge of the year long cold again where the list is really do just you know you're missing the red

230
00:28:20,05 --> 00:28:38,88
boys being called off the show you hear talk of the board of directors sure what you see why hasn't he thought of this

231
00:28:38,88 --> 00:28:43,57
good looking long for the gays night.

232
00:28:43,94 --> 00:29:13,61
We will be sure to be sure he would rather be you know you can point out here and you can raise your right.

233
00:29:13,94 --> 00:29:41,79
Very very tall and the story will show that he was also told you know that some of the recovery from last night.

234
00:29:41,87 --> 00:29:48,17
Most of the other you're still right.

235
00:29:48,25 --> 00:30:00,27
Every Sunday when he had the great good aeration of the late sixty's early seventy's. I mean there are seasons.

236
00:30:01,26 --> 00:30:13,24
Really you know this liberation you say just coming out here for all the cities I went to in Europe.

237
00:30:14,13 --> 00:30:28,66
I used to get the borrows so we get a little older so right through here I really meant was that the days like this.

238
00:30:30,39 --> 00:30:31,74
Yes they were older years

239
00:30:31,74 --> 00:30:40,21
and they got the signs of the right people are exactly the same look if you were in that zone are you stuck there for

240
00:30:40,21 --> 00:30:41,25
everything was going on.

241
00:30:41,34 --> 00:30:42,54
You could be sitting here

242
00:30:42,54 --> 00:30:56,47
but I had to do a little bit of the United look right down to get dark runs on the way around so I knew I was a good

243
00:30:56,47 --> 00:31:09,44
looking out on here that actually was that they were all right. And I had seen something there.

244
00:31:09,45 --> 00:31:22,18
All right if you're into the street and there you have stayed there pretty good. There's a very very bright day here.

245
00:31:22,24 --> 00:31:38,17
The scene with the hoses of places like this is not what I often think that there was that run that that violent

246
00:31:38,17 --> 00:31:45,54
opposition where it just off of just over the street. No harm the parish yesterday that well I think that again.

247
00:31:46,07 --> 00:31:48,36
I mean I love the reading matter who gets here.

248
00:31:48,45 --> 00:31:54,15
Yes I never went there but I mean I did they're not happy but I believe but over the years.

249
00:31:54,2 --> 00:32:01,16
It was always had a reputation to some extent very helpful.

250
00:32:01,63 --> 00:32:11,15
This is the last it was then the Australian certainly predated me

251
00:32:11,91 --> 00:32:18,1
and I think they were mentioned in their rooms for years together with Israel

252
00:32:20,48 --> 00:32:27,17
and of course he is one of the work to do it all behind us now that he was a great hire because a bisexual

253
00:32:27,17 --> 00:32:28,93
or somebody like

254
00:32:28,93 --> 00:32:37,51
and I was advised that it was a secure place really here where the very real good letter year there's a real life as a

255
00:32:37,54 --> 00:32:42,26
result that is the stronger I'm sorry to say learning in the thirty years

256
00:32:42,26 --> 00:32:45,87
or something like Philip had a strong attraction for him

257
00:32:45,87 --> 00:32:53,02
and that was a strong attraction for him because I really had passed a very example to me now.

258
00:32:53,77 --> 00:33:02,14
Well obviously he had women friends he had the number of was he enjoyed. Well there was a lot of I got on with it.

259
00:33:02,18 --> 00:33:07,8
Yes you're headed up the right kind of jumping out of your love.

260
00:33:07,87 --> 00:33:17,9
There's actually a little bit of course I have to say for the same reason I don't know but maybe I just made it all.

261
00:33:17,91 --> 00:33:28,17
I was saying is that he used to get into rushes straight shooters in his autobiography I wouldn't be sure about that

262
00:33:28,17 --> 00:33:35,08
but I hear that someone writes really recently about which I had I had read where he said that in an interview prior

263
00:33:35,08 --> 00:33:35,83
years ago.

264
00:33:35,92 --> 00:33:42,96
Frankly I had not actually I had thought of it from a gay point of view because

265
00:33:42,96 --> 00:33:48,33
when I first read about that regard to this before the general public.

266
00:33:48,34 --> 00:33:55,34
Except of those places or in other words they were the three places of Sydney.

267
00:33:55,36 --> 00:34:00,69
If you were a sort of somebody who dropped in on Sydney and you're it out for good.

268
00:34:01,26 --> 00:34:12,16
I get all the rest of it and you get to those places where you know it was just a moment but he just told you it was

269
00:34:12,16 --> 00:34:19,46
or was rubbish me a Southern rock. I think it was at Taco Bell Theosophists right. Oh it was. Yes this role.

270
00:34:19,49 --> 00:34:26,37
Yes he decided this yes I used to get it was right for a little rough rough right here self-will the cells were good

271
00:34:26,37 --> 00:34:31,45
and it was quite the same thing to get it and hung up.

272
00:34:31,45 --> 00:34:41,41
OK Guy going to buy all the drinks in the old really you know little bit of it and leave the live video of it

273
00:34:41,41 --> 00:34:48,87
and then just write the last minute just around six o'clock you do real quick to six your excuses show together the to

274
00:34:48,87 --> 00:34:56,51
the to the business to live your good guy is OK because they have to work any sell you a bridge for us to make sure you

275
00:34:56,51 --> 00:35:06,41
sort of sub to begin to disappear somebody is that what you're still feels just pick your leaders have today off to

276
00:35:06,41 --> 00:35:10,78
something else and it was absolutely it was it was it.

277
00:35:10,93 --> 00:35:18,38
Well it was six of the letters really which is why he was referred to write a letter to all the laws of my theory

278
00:35:18,38 --> 00:35:19,91
everywhere.

279
00:35:19,96 --> 00:35:24,78
I really thought it was about knowledge your taxes

280
00:35:24,78 --> 00:35:32,34
and you very well for the whole of the back room Brown will say well over marriage for example you give your party

281
00:35:32,34 --> 00:35:47,64
trick caller ID. Oh you know you actually real jobs where I look so they can appreciate it. Here goes.

282
00:35:47,79 --> 00:35:59,12
One of the one of the pubs in the early fifty's tried to get rid of the gays who say we used to know rather than just

283
00:35:59,12 --> 00:35:59,51
crossed over.

284
00:36:01,72 --> 00:36:11,84
Well Dorry says OK well hold here shows and she saw us Australians or start telling us here

285
00:36:11,9 --> 00:36:18,85
and here it actually was so we read this night we wrote it in the rain we read the paper.

286
00:36:19,14 --> 00:36:25,68
There's a career it just plays and the through the mandatory.

287
00:36:28,27 --> 00:36:32,39
You can already see a short phrase leave this hotel

288
00:36:32,39 --> 00:36:46,55
and never come back here who must sending Who knows how to load by really close up the lovely river of his which is

289
00:36:47,73 --> 00:36:53,01
Raphael nearly every other man in the race the ricks here for a period.

290
00:36:55,2 --> 00:37:00,88
This will be nice for The Dark Knight Rider to toss the war.

291
00:37:01,73 --> 00:37:05,51
I was there while on the run up to do something else

292
00:37:05,51 --> 00:37:15,56
and there's only as we left down at the doorstep with you in mind not coming back here again thank you very much.

293

We don't want your time here for the last very low cost for the bricks should be good wishes for your office beginnings.

294
00:37:30,16 --> 00:37:33,91
Yes you're right we need this yet to set right from the start

295
00:37:36,01 --> 00:37:44,92
but the shape of the race for your great race is next year it's really good to see the issues rather than the lottery.

296
00:37:46,63 --> 00:37:53,37
Yet you know I'm meeting with House right on the seat in the city and in the house at the front of the face of the air.

301
00:38:27,43 --> 00:38:29,4
Yeah but I have to go out

00:39:23,31 --> 00:39:30,72
but I still think the House of people are scared of their own right. Yes for us to get along. They're right.

310
00:39:30,73 --> 00:39:45,66
They're very I'm full seems to me blind a bit before I know that God spoke to us to hear what you believe just being

311
00:39:45,66 --> 00:39:53,6
friends with the expect to hear that you do get that love very often.

312
00:39:53,63 --> 00:40:01,1
All I feel when I get off like that if I just meet someone someone new my entire life I might be.

313
00:40:01,4 --> 00:40:06,33
I have done or something like to chat to them when I checked it might be afraid of us

314
00:40:06,79 --> 00:40:08,84
and we have a bit of a sort of hero.

315
00:40:09,12 --> 00:40:16,07
You know and what have you all this stuff is in the US that this has that resume again through tough love.

316
00:40:17,26 --> 00:40:24,42
Good luck to his son on the much get into bed with him again through all of this is getting our first right here.

317
00:40:24,85 --> 00:40:28,33
So it's like you're missing his heart years later.

318
00:40:30,03 --> 00:40:38,9
Oh it's really it's not what are we going to give us from first to get the show. That's right.

319
00:40:38,95 --> 00:40:46,35
Is it really a rehash of this it has evolved into the reader with a I got a very old check.

320
00:40:46,42 --> 00:40:51,18
I haven't checked it out and you get what I have checked a few strangers with nothing.

321
00:40:51,36 --> 00:40:59,71
The end of it but there is a slight chance. Oh readers think I'm a woman you're good.

322
00:41:00,04 --> 00:41:07,75
When you start all over this depressing uh oh this is doing well you know you girls are doing good. It is a pleasure.

323
00:41:07,77 --> 00:41:14,08
Oh you don't make up you were you are now I am going to get somebody that you really hope for the things you think OK

324
00:41:14,08 --> 00:41:14,86
great.

325
00:41:15,05 --> 00:41:24,61
Like you know I'll become actually make sure I get psychotic rather than a little bit of age

326
00:41:24,61 --> 00:41:31,39
and I was writing for breakfast to somebody else and I get to say I could leave for eight hours or so

327
00:41:31,39 --> 00:41:37,18
but I just had just a telegram really I just messed up. You know I'm a good girl.

328
00:41:37,28 --> 00:41:43,66
Really I was trying to say a very nice phrase but here. We have to the kitchen jacket you know you're digital.

329
00:41:43,91 --> 00:41:59,01
I was Go read the break to get the book. The players messed up the coffee going back to the.

330
00:42:02,26 --> 00:42:09,91
Was it your impression of people of the music for one thing or the other but rather see his ability to write poetry.

331
00:42:11,11 --> 00:42:18,22
The way he did used to be the sort of thing that you have to accept of I think rather more than that is the case in

332
00:42:20,68 --> 00:42:22,81
this he has.

333
00:42:22,88 --> 00:42:26,63
You had to discard as to whether you were as excited as it will

334
00:42:26,63 --> 00:42:32,05
or you have to suddenly be you are going over the road here and

335
00:42:32,05 --> 00:42:40,07
and if if you had a friendship with another I have a six year old guy was passive like he was a preacher's like that

336
00:42:40,07 --> 00:42:46,88
resistance that he expresses that it's safer because she's my sister room room.

337
00:42:46,93 --> 00:42:51,2
Well you have another thing in your house little thing you have a little little hand here.

338
00:42:51,54 --> 00:42:57,71
So this phrase rather resting shriek and I was fussing at this factory and said here.

339
00:42:57,86 --> 00:43:05,94
I really either of those two sisters share in heat of actually getting saved through this how shocking

340
00:43:05,94 --> 00:43:13,41
but it has been that is how you know which is my sister she made me Agent sister.

341
00:43:13,49 --> 00:43:19,91
I was married and look she let him come down the always felt she would not be as there was more slowly.

342
00:43:20,51 --> 00:43:26,86
The figure of you have to decide. So the increase really didn't do it or you can go with me.

343
00:43:26,93 --> 00:43:36,26
You're saying no this is merely looking more to that other outbids I know that I'm very old interrogates felt

344
00:43:36,26 --> 00:43:40,7
and our jobs are equated And he said to this out there

345
00:43:40,7 --> 00:43:48,11
and he said well you are we're told YOU WANT OUR we're told we're just have the birth to the bush we're just have to

346
00:43:48,11 --> 00:43:55,17
buy the books that's already been established and good about your heart into the first year

347
00:43:55,17 --> 00:44:01,16
and it's a good to be with the spirit here talking yet the very are not really there.

348
00:44:01,26 --> 00:44:06,87
You described series it out because he think it by Syria he did that using it was in the period.

349
00:44:06,91 --> 00:44:11,02
If you were six foot tall and very thin

350
00:44:11,3 --> 00:44:18,4
and rather than you probably right now you can be desirable you have to be going to see here rest Yes that's right.

351
00:44:18,56 --> 00:44:20,95
Yes yes I was there a way there

352
00:44:21,01 --> 00:44:31,85
and then as a painter the result of realisation I heard about it that there was a muslim up at Dawson microspheres

353
00:44:32,99 --> 00:44:39,87
which was done you know that you can probably do the books because in the country as you go doesn't know with the with

354
00:44:40,23 --> 00:44:47,07
with play those folks because you sure if you play this you're not forwards it's really something good come of it like

355
00:44:47,07 --> 00:44:50,94
I do that and you become the you was wrong.

356
00:44:50,96 --> 00:44:58,08
Fraser and Ross Buchanan and I was told and she had an interview with the press

357
00:44:58,08 --> 00:45:02,88
and this was brought to trial about rugby and for three years

358
00:45:02,88 --> 00:45:08,24
and she had the interview with a pretty sure it she said Oh it's all there.

359
00:45:08,44 --> 00:45:18,79
All of it in the sun they're all quite a perceptual Oreos. They're all the whole and tall and over six feet tall.

360
00:45:19,03 --> 00:45:27,11
They're they're all strong tall and over six feet tall. There isn't there is no six through the doors in the world.

361
00:45:27,23 --> 00:45:30,61
You know in a hot tub.

362
00:45:30,74 --> 00:45:39,44
Where it's free for the night but she was on this bit of an active duty as you translate was self.

363
00:45:39,53 --> 00:45:46,84
She really did she try and look so she didn't she. Illusion that there was really great about taking the job.

364
00:45:47,05 --> 00:45:52,13
Basically she was a difficulty ordinary sort of housewife a sort of real man

365
00:45:52,13 --> 00:45:57,67
and she was surrounded by all these great Irish was attracted to. Oh she's ha ha ha leader.

366
00:45:57,73 --> 00:46:01,1
Trying to get most of them today. I'll be sorry if she had.

367
00:46:01,26 --> 00:46:08,51
They understand where security should be given that you know that here stuff always knows it's rather like the old

368
00:46:08,51 --> 00:46:15,51
or old millions he's been told and they're on their heads or these are all rather tongue nice Verrall here and there.

369
00:46:15,74 --> 00:46:17,35
Yes they're all there six feet tall.

370
00:46:17,9 --> 00:46:25,56
That's how this could set up this process began to rub your tongue runs right up there not to mention the other this

371
00:46:25,56 --> 00:46:26,2
rubbish

372
00:46:27,92 --> 00:46:39,93
but I think it really was wrong to hear that six feet away a session was right there was was cautious Lawrence good in

373
00:46:39,93 --> 00:46:47,03
the US Good on you. Yes sir yes sir and all of the very religious.

374
00:46:47,04 --> 00:47:02,38
The boy is a long years of misery with the boys that you share that was just really sad for all I know you got a lot

375
00:47:02,38 --> 00:47:05,54
older sister had her.

376
00:47:05,64 --> 00:47:14,75
Yes Yes I read a mention on your opinion about that he was very friendly with a woman he used to reduce the City

377
00:47:14,75 --> 00:47:19,54
University dramatics just as my dream was off.

378
00:47:19,75 --> 00:47:27,93
She was really the night of the mother's people breaks it to show you live.

379
00:47:28,02 --> 00:47:35,88
Probably she did talk about nightmares a sort of the repression narrows in the family because she was well she was a

380
00:47:35,88 --> 00:47:39,37
very intelligent woman but certainly much more intelligent.

381
00:47:39,74 --> 00:47:44,61
All right here but I still say nothing but she was nothing more.

382
00:47:44,69 --> 00:47:52,38
And yes here much more and and she was very attractive can actually raise my right.

383
00:47:52,39 --> 00:48:01,07
But I think her and her mentor and emotional that are going to be on the set and say against things. I mean.

384
00:48:01,45 --> 00:48:11,04
DENYER they were there and they went there just sort of here in a whirl too much of it just like consciousness.

385
00:48:11,25 --> 00:48:12,81
Yes Yes that's right.

386
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:15,98
He doesn't love it yet but I think he

387
00:48:15,98 --> 00:48:26,56
and the jury loved being with them because there you will see a charming person to talk to everybody else with the lead.

388
00:48:26,56 --> 00:48:42,81
I wish I could I just say go away. You never discussed that with us.

389
00:48:43,27 --> 00:48:51,96
She was so young she lost a great role and I was a boy that was already here.

390
00:48:52,11 --> 00:49:04,23
I feel so very very comfortable last Monday because of some oh you might get really hurt a little bit like that.

391
00:49:04,24 --> 00:49:09,83
That's a section of the law you must get a lot of the yard here but you see the thing that may shoot.

392
00:49:10,00 --> 00:49:11,25
Cheap to produce place

393
00:49:11,25 --> 00:49:20,19
and there was a story which by remarkable producer in her later years perhaps not in the Hague

394
00:49:20,19 --> 00:49:30,7
and we would have a reversal or we would have known Sam Eventually we don't know how often CROSSFIRE

395
00:49:30,7 --> 00:49:39,05
and group made it would make me mad and about six guys and we gave up trying to have a fire all the way Kashmir

396
00:49:39,05 --> 00:49:40,19
and we'd sit there.

397
00:49:40,21 --> 00:49:48,1
About three smoking countless cigarettes and talking about drug use and I was facing was in jail as well

398
00:49:48,1 --> 00:49:59,78
but never really on this issue right here. So I got here ready and we made a reference to an interesting.

399
00:49:59,86 --> 00:50:00,98
I didn't buy it.

400
00:50:01,42 --> 00:50:09,1
These are women that whole from the thing I needed was a body run Sydney know not to get that straight

401
00:50:09,1 --> 00:50:15,77
and start talking about it. Something similar was there really was there any all in all major story.

402
00:50:15,79 --> 00:50:22,85
I didn't know there was a time trial and that was in the fifty's. That was in most of the fish would be world peace.

403
00:50:23,04 --> 00:50:25,1
It was set up the full report.

404
00:50:25,35 --> 00:50:31,4
He said that the whole of the fight started about but it's not really fifty three with one hundred people doing.

405
00:50:31,67 --> 00:50:41,26
Joe you're told. Life is a national run here a shadow record and a long rope and I.

406
00:50:41,28 --> 00:50:48,89
You can bet your straight they're just saying to you about the stress reduction.

407
00:50:49,44 --> 00:50:53,73
We've got the reaction to the press about you was your reporting.

408
00:50:53,82 --> 00:51:05,17
People were generally has been a mono he hung intelligent people. Yes because I mean to anybody.

409
00:51:05,18 --> 00:51:14,25
So the stick their head up all right. It's a form of this device will start with an organization.

410
00:51:14,28 --> 00:51:23,66
This is again the again the word the word gay organizations in you know through the fifty's Sutra fell because they

411
00:51:23,66 --> 00:51:26,83
were there you can do a lot of gay organizations

412
00:51:26,83 --> 00:51:42,56
and there is nothing with the recession here until very recently really just really just down the road here

413
00:51:42,56 --> 00:51:51,87
and then the security of the drug trail this young heiress that was hit was over the feeling was something that's just

414
00:51:51,87 --> 00:51:59,57
three years later there was that later then yeah you can because for countless phone to believe with

415
00:51:59,57 --> 00:52:01,00
when did this phase interfere.

416
00:52:01,29 --> 00:52:12,55
Go all the theories free candy which poses interview are you going to be there is because that was convenient to do

417
00:52:12,55 --> 00:52:20,99
this if you love to read the news for everything you know what we really do that you're working on we didn't read like

418
00:52:21,83 --> 00:52:28,58
no you were being there gazing very rigid very uncivil to sit so he got down there

419
00:52:30,69 --> 00:52:44,39
and then try to stop us getting Oh you said Dr desires don't think of yourself as you really are you really just really

420
00:52:44,39 --> 00:52:58,12
going to have you this if you're sure that we would love you probably have to pack up again because I didn't show you

421
00:52:58,12 --> 00:53:02,19
the man on the door that day playing to the south. Did you know something.

422
00:53:02,21 --> 00:53:10,54
The fact that you know this is a real structural Russian how we ended up being wrong for cuisine. Yeah.

423
00:53:10,91 --> 00:53:13,8
And then she just said this stuff will show you something.

424
00:53:14,05 --> 00:53:19,97
This is just your usual run you want a very long

425
00:53:19,97 --> 00:53:35,43
but you know what with let me just let you know you can't swallow Polish

426
00:53:35,43 --> 00:53:40,48
and I had the song you guys are you being a Christian in this song

427
00:53:40,48 --> 00:53:48,43
or you Blues we had some of the strangest I guess this is something to research the why are you going through your list

428
00:53:48,43 --> 00:54:20,08
or your skills you know so you know but it's a risk. I'm a commuter guy that's a very few go.

429
00:54:21,96 --> 00:54:25,85
Let's drop the rather this is the story to go.

430
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:34,46
Most people are wondering well I thought that was mildly and you can get whole story here to get together more

431
00:54:34,46 --> 00:54:38,96
or less just carries a gun when we get serious and when you're drunk.

432
00:54:39,07 --> 00:54:46,22
You just sort of going at this for about three or about simple Oh right.

433
00:54:46,33 --> 00:54:58,06
Takes for the whole of the world and why you should do it with your man you know a guy who got it.

434
00:54:58,57 --> 00:55:27,01
So yes it was just here it is just a little ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh I did read another good way.

435
00:55:27,2 --> 00:55:37,43
Yes there's fire fighting here I like I thought tonight today. They've got that Percy knows it's going to cause a liar.

436
00:55:37,63 --> 00:55:45,32
Right now. All right Kate. Yeah I was shocked to hear that three.

437
00:55:45,51 --> 00:55:52,31
I think the color of the three pages not just you and the they had the richness of the sign right there.

438
00:55:52,7 --> 00:55:58,13
But I usually get the side to the president here boxing gloves are really tight a lot of plywood

439
00:55:58,13 --> 00:56:02,76
or all you can hang out. So yes yes. Well you lose your fingers.

440
00:56:03,15 --> 00:56:10,71
They should hold all your data carelessly which will say that the box. Yes yes yes this is worse.

441
00:56:11,47 --> 00:56:16,54
It's error than true yes education does nothing to help. It's not John Bell.

442
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:19,78
You know all those are you guys are like the very same studio.

443
00:56:20,46 --> 00:56:25,59
Percy Rose was the big gun he was red

444
00:56:25,71 --> 00:56:48,1
and yellow boxes because he's very well in many down the road is the only right a circular are made by me very well is

445
00:56:48,1 --> 00:56:52,04
here now he may have know you something.

446
00:57:00,79 --> 00:57:06,34
Well I think we've talked ourselves with our young listeners really begin early learning anything

447
00:57:06,34 --> 00:57:12,51
and I mean let me help you church just about we're just going to drive you do you really thing is the way we get here

448
00:57:12,51 --> 00:57:20,19
we just simply write on then you can solve a lot of cultural you know here said things were really I mean that's where

449
00:57:20,23 --> 00:57:28,9
we can begin to get from where you say songs of a phone call to a lot of people they hear it every day

450
00:57:28,9 --> 00:57:36,86
or hear things which leads very hard to sort of grow up is the fact that in that period we talked about we were in our

451
00:57:37,06 --> 00:57:37,82
late teens

452
00:57:37,82 --> 00:57:46,82
or early transition you lead a different lifestyle you do hear say coming out of office getting on the Outer Banks away

453
00:57:46,82 --> 00:58:01,09
all hail the time it was because for years just to be free to look beyond that will.

454
00:58:01,57 --> 00:58:06,44
Straight now he's pointed out for you to get a say a year on New Year's Eve.

455
00:58:06,47 --> 00:58:14,08
John I ran to the sea for the summer sun trust.

456
00:58:14,18 --> 00:58:26,67
Come now we're talking coming up again here within reach of the rest of the refusal of him for not a lot about the

457
00:58:26,76 --> 00:58:32,48
people. There's a little bit of drag with the Grays from both caves.

458
00:58:32,62 --> 00:58:42,27
He's now the just great Aunt Beatrice you see here right now that I have you where there is larger than life

459
00:58:42,63 --> 00:58:52,25
but we had was a single young bull the bit that you know today or a yellow dog the rather young boy was here really.

460
00:58:52,43 --> 00:58:52,75
Every year

461
00:58:52,75 --> 00:59:04,26
and that was the key not the drag the drag like war was never my God it was just fraught with the ole years with the

462
00:59:04,26 --> 00:59:13,68
mighty we're stuck with this big kid who's a straight shot to the ceiling through the floor a very glamorous evening

463
00:59:13,68 --> 00:59:14,45
from here

464
00:59:14,45 --> 00:59:25,69
and the drug hero leprous he was a hero to the lovers strike force restraint you know you're writing from very very

465
00:59:25,69 --> 00:59:39,24
unlikely next year while you're wearing your sun the good stories are gone right through before breaking my heart.

466
00:59:39,54 --> 00:59:46,86
Oh my god the bridge let a priest go.

467
00:59:47,01 --> 00:59:54,38
Surely with a little stuffy sound downright mean that we have to drive or we could start another get up going our way.

468
00:59:54,47 --> 01:00:00,83
Frank doesn't tell you yet it seriously are a little over a lot of really good.

469
01:00:01,29 --> 01:00:06,75
Because you think looking at land you know you get made a gesture

470
01:00:06,9 --> 01:00:16,95
and it should be a good sequence of the work were done just to yesterday just really to fall back on the bus the Big

471
01:00:16,95 --> 01:00:20,27
Bang where there is hand rolled out probably headed right.

472
01:00:20,38 --> 01:00:32,09
She was putting your hand down like that you used to measure grouse Moses there was this child.

473
01:00:32,14 --> 01:00:33,6
Let's run the great question.

474
01:00:33,96 --> 01:00:47,27
Jane Foley all this artificial really artificial real shot on the scene practicing for the bigger fish to go through.

475
01:00:47,45 --> 01:00:49,23
So here. Greg was Greg.

476
01:00:49,33 --> 01:00:57,14
He was a drag race drag and it was well this is the good news the family business with here they really believe him.

477
01:00:57,29 --> 01:01:07,51
Did you see that film with me rode the ride was here so let's go to Gracie race you get to a break you don't mind the

478
01:01:07,51 --> 01:01:15,64
break a very long week in that beehive start with Robert De Niro he has got the tour right up. That's right.

479
01:01:15,67 --> 01:01:25,41
And it made love acceptance of course the brainchild of not just write music right here.

480
01:01:25,58 --> 01:01:33,36
Here you see right here you see good our group there really and truly I don't see in the song so much

481
01:01:33,36 --> 01:01:40,17
or anyone else here but I can speculate. John's or I just threw responsible for me.

482
01:01:40,4 --> 01:01:50,67
John Mann sorry the royal we ever heard of it was I use oil because I feel he was too magnificent man he was a hell of

483
01:01:50,67 --> 01:01:56,88
a lot of what Bob and you wanted to hear a lot about town the runway where he presented something to you.

484
01:01:57,06 --> 01:02:00,82
It is it's there it's gone and we really does now.

485
01:02:01,32 --> 01:02:11,44
Usually it's it's a new person nation because the only person nations are so sick of it isn't the same time just it

486
01:02:11,44 --> 01:02:20,68
just raises so they are in the middle of the result of something else as the pressure that the cancer hit

487
01:02:20,68 --> 01:02:29,07
and I hope they can get for us we hadn't done that before. So there was absolutely. You want me abuse.

488
01:02:29,39 --> 01:02:33,56
We was very busy you know typically with all of that Mark Heard this year through funny

489
01:02:33,56 --> 01:02:40,31
or was it apparently he got himself for a healthy weight something like that very very closely

490
01:02:40,31 --> 01:02:47,19
and I longed for him to have just walked Longoria over to numbers where he was absolutely still there.

491
01:02:47,29 --> 01:02:54,65
As I did actually straight because of course felt it really emotional overlays really because you get through.

492
01:02:54,87 --> 01:03:00,42
Absolutely. Can't you with what he's doing by really here and all and polish you do physically.

493
01:03:00,45 --> 01:03:03,18
Yes British thing right.
