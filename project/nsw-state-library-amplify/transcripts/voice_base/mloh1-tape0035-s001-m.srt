1
00:00:04,87 --> 00:00:07,31
There is but i'll start again. Mrs.

2
00:00:07,31 --> 00:00:13,67
Procreate you were born in scotland in
dumfries you maxwell to match your claim and

3
00:00:13,68 --> 00:00:15,80
do you remember when you as

4
00:00:15,81 --> 00:00:21,63
a nineteen 03 wasn't it. Yeah. Yes and you
remember when you were young girls your

5
00:00:21,63 --> 00:00:28,37
first remembrance of dumfries it's go
away or those days it was very vague. You

6
00:00:28,37 --> 00:00:35,07
know sure those days the noise my shoes
i know i know but all i can remember.

7
00:00:35,68 --> 00:00:42,60
But we never had enough to eat. And those
days were pretty father my mother was

8
00:00:42,60 --> 00:00:48,13
married twice a year so the stepfather
ship mother went to work for

9
00:00:48,13 --> 00:00:53,53
a keep us and she went on the forty
two. When she died she had such

10
00:00:53,53 --> 00:00:59,42
a struggle. Did you did your
father die or was he said i'm

11
00:00:59,43 --> 00:01:01,63
a very very young the heart of

12
00:01:01,63 --> 00:01:07,71
a rather odd place suddenly so you don't
remember your father and you know how to

13
00:01:07,72 --> 00:01:12,27
back to work for us. What was
your stepfather like and what he

14
00:01:14,58 --> 00:01:17,69
dreamed i was a bit of everything he was

15
00:01:17,69 --> 00:01:24,64
a no hoper save for the
way and half the time

16
00:01:24,64 --> 00:01:31,53
he would be here and work anyway as
it was many jobs to be got but i can

17
00:01:31,53 --> 00:01:36,92
remember your child the churches used
to dress us. He really had nothing

18
00:01:39,42 --> 00:01:45,20
and i always i can always remember
the catholic church as i was

19
00:01:45,21 --> 00:01:51,87
a top of the hill. And someone to give
my sister feel under rotten buttons

20
00:01:53,09 --> 00:01:59,04
and she walked in the way that i walked
away. So when she walked in the way of all

21
00:01:59,04 --> 00:02:04,74
that was it the boy just treat someone
does have badly off. We were out and never

22
00:02:04,74 --> 00:02:11,31
remember i have no pair of shoes till i was
twelve and then i fell down the stairs

23
00:02:12,16 --> 00:02:18,47
with had you going to snow in the winter
heard you call and it was clogs where

24
00:02:18,48 --> 00:02:24,59
clogs. But i would have much warmth
in them. No i was very very it's

25
00:02:24,59 --> 00:02:30,52
a long time ago. But i can remember
getting things given to us.

26
00:02:31,62 --> 00:02:33,59
And i'm not very tall. I've got

27
00:02:33,59 --> 00:02:39,37
a quote given to me and it was right
and why i thought i must have been

28
00:02:39,37 --> 00:02:45,08
a. You know they could fit me when
i was sixteen i thought it was.

29
00:02:46,38 --> 00:02:50,48
Only singing to go you know had a new
dress and yet a life and we've had

30
00:02:50,48 --> 00:02:54,63
a little and the food alone because we
used to go to free breakfast on my sunday

31
00:02:54,63 --> 00:02:59,42
morning. Where was that
all i was led to know was

32
00:02:59,42 --> 00:03:05,53
a church is to give the free breakfast
or not but we used to go to that free

33
00:03:05,53 --> 00:03:08,00
breakfast or much on one front to go for

34
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:13,65
a free breakfast mind you but i know as i
remember the first day i started work i

35
00:03:13,65 --> 00:03:13,88
draw

36
00:03:13,88 --> 00:03:20,35
a thirteen and when i went home. There was
no food no house for my lunch. I thought

37
00:03:20,35 --> 00:03:26,72
it was back to nothing that was there when
the war started. I was just before the

38
00:03:26,73 --> 00:03:33,63
war. Yes only started
going to three and ten to

39
00:03:33,63 --> 00:03:39,78
thirteen fourteen fifteen year.
Yes yes and my mother had

40
00:03:39,78 --> 00:03:45,80
a very very hard struggle. My stepfather
went to india. Nay she got money.

41
00:03:46,96 --> 00:03:53,33
I don't know whether she got money for
all of us. I enjoyed it's yes he was an

42
00:03:53,33 --> 00:03:57,10
indian for about four years
coming back to him was he

43
00:03:57,10 --> 00:04:01,55
a violent man. Well it could
be a birch who is more of

44
00:04:01,55 --> 00:04:05,10
a. Well i will put it more of a sex many

45
00:04:05,10 --> 00:04:11,33
a bit and stay in the house alone
mother always tried to shield us

46
00:04:12,87 --> 00:04:17,26
and that wasn't i was very hard but they
showed all of us to look after you all

47
00:04:17,26 --> 00:04:24,00
girls but you know three or
four roles and the youngest one

48
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:30,85
marlon died when i was fourteen and
they unleashed brothers and there was

49
00:04:30,86 --> 00:04:33,37
good and they are me it was to get

50
00:04:33,37 --> 00:04:37,25
a special food. It was younger than
he should have been. Do you know as

51
00:04:37,25 --> 00:04:42,44
a homeless broken up. Do you remember
going to school. Yeah i remember going to

52
00:04:42,44 --> 00:04:48,09
school and the smell right up to my knees.
I can remember that quite well i say

53
00:04:48,09 --> 00:04:54,99
he's four and because half the time we
were never that school because my mother

54
00:04:54,99 --> 00:04:55,26
was always

55
00:04:55,26 --> 00:05:02,10
a little bit of cancer and
just from it could have done

56
00:05:02,11 --> 00:05:09,01
something for us. She don't remember
when you left. I'm free. So how long

57
00:05:09,01 --> 00:05:15,19
we were in doing proofs. Well i stayed
there are the family went to england after

58
00:05:15,19 --> 00:05:19,97
that and i said. There
we're save for what's

59
00:05:19,98 --> 00:05:25,54
a couple of years now and i went there and
i'm your mother went down to england. My

60
00:05:25,54 --> 00:05:30,72
mother was there. You know that was dead
but the patri full of it. That's as. You

61
00:05:30,72 --> 00:05:35,24
know you were in don't freeze all the time.
Yes i was at the rest of the family had

62
00:05:35,24 --> 00:05:42,07
moved to manchester. They're still there.
The rest of them and i stay there for

63
00:05:42,07 --> 00:05:48,88
a while. Work and all and mills. And
then i went to england i went to

64
00:05:48,88 --> 00:05:54,10
service and then i shelled
out here must have been

65
00:05:54,10 --> 00:06:00,76
a main street years where i can wait
here. Thinking back to your childhood in

66
00:06:01,97 --> 00:06:06,93
shall we say but 1910 before the first world
war. What was it like in dumfries said

67
00:06:08,49 --> 00:06:15,34
i was just saying and i had no work.
No. And i must work for anyone even

68
00:06:16,05 --> 00:06:21,72
knows jesus and what i left out that
wasn't i was well for him but then i don't

69
00:06:21,72 --> 00:06:27,37
care what anybody says if they're saying
everything was good. You know stupid you

70
00:06:27,37 --> 00:06:32,60
know what was not true. What was it like
there by comparison to what it was like

71
00:06:32,60 --> 00:06:35,00
here in nineteen twenty nine. She was

72
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:41,88
a lot of their step father was july.

73
00:06:42,70 --> 00:06:47,88
And let me think back. You know i was in
service myself that was all sort of war

74
00:06:47,88 --> 00:06:49,99
thinking about the
conditions when you were

75
00:06:49,99 --> 00:06:56,72
a child and therefore the first world war
and how hard it was then was that harder

76
00:06:56,72 --> 00:07:03,48
than it was here in 1920. Oh yes oh yes
yes i would say you got nothing from the

77
00:07:03,48 --> 00:07:09,02
government and no state or no and no matter
how many kids you had you got nothing

78
00:07:09,02 --> 00:07:15,48
for them and so it was one
struggle to better of here. Except

79
00:07:18,20 --> 00:07:19,70
i mean just so we had a fear of

80
00:07:19,70 --> 00:07:26,57
a bad spend here. You can't
live man and wife and

81
00:07:26,57 --> 00:07:32,36
a child under twelve months time ancient
so weak and if i notice that but more than

82
00:07:32,36 --> 00:07:37,58
my sister come right here. She's asked me
but never lived on twenty six shillings

83
00:07:37,58 --> 00:07:44,58
a week i was shelling and i said no i've
ever lived. Own lane. She said no loss or

84
00:07:44,58 --> 00:07:51,40
die and we lived on nine shillings.
Except when he got to extend five and

85
00:07:51,41 --> 00:07:56,27
we'd have five weeks rent out of
that before we lived at all because

86
00:07:56,28 --> 00:07:59,83
a give nothing for a child
under twelve months and i had

87
00:07:59,83 --> 00:08:05,27
a bad time five in line and i went
to the doctor and they wrote out

88
00:08:05,27 --> 00:08:11,87
a you know alleged fort i had to have and
the brought it right down to one and six

89
00:08:11,87 --> 00:08:18,56
and all and lasted five months and we
would break down dizzy you know and

90
00:08:18,56 --> 00:08:25,40
after that got past it but you're
supposed to get. I think was five

91
00:08:25,40 --> 00:08:31,26
shillings for the child after that and
well still but he pushed because it was

92
00:08:31,26 --> 00:08:36,03
formed six months of the groceries one and
six and for the meat and the rest was

93
00:08:36,03 --> 00:08:40,62
retreating bread and milk no money and you
never got any money and you go in with

94
00:08:40,62 --> 00:08:45,87
a room in the just gotten paid you couldn't
pay the rent. Did you get invicta trim

95
00:08:45,87 --> 00:08:50,07
anywhere did you know we were fortunate
next door to it though i had

96
00:08:50,07 --> 00:08:55,42
a friend that under house and shouldn't
rely on it like the rented church street

97
00:08:55,42 --> 00:09:01,02
and she asked us to go and live down. I
had to look after her. That's the way i

98
00:09:01,02 --> 00:09:02,24
don't know what would happen to

99
00:09:02,24 --> 00:09:08,87
a lot of aid because it
wasn't funny but i went to

100
00:09:08,87 --> 00:09:14,90
a meeting once. And i was always
interested in political things

101
00:09:17,03 --> 00:09:21,31
and the chap sitting there
said we've come a long way in

102
00:09:21,31 --> 00:09:24,86
a hundred years. And i
thought about that for

103
00:09:24,86 --> 00:09:30,90
a minute and i said. How do you make that
out. You should. Well look what we have

104
00:09:30,90 --> 00:09:35,98
today flash if you're only getting five
shows i mean where i get in five shillings

105
00:09:35,98 --> 00:09:40,41
a week here and there's eureka stockade
there we get more than that. So how could

106
00:09:40,41 --> 00:09:42,37
you be better off and

107
00:09:42,38 --> 00:09:49,22
a hundred years had come nowhere but
my opinion you had come and it went

108
00:09:49,22 --> 00:09:51,98
a hundred years when a man takes five six

109
00:09:51,98 --> 00:09:58,35
a week to live on it when you had one do
you have two children then as no one was

110
00:09:58,35 --> 00:10:03,24
winter which in getting for
him. Terrorists twelve month or

111
00:10:05,48 --> 00:10:10,02
two. You just had to live and i
went to the baby show to them do

112
00:10:10,02 --> 00:10:15,70
a baby show when he was six months and
i asked if you could have extra food

113
00:10:17,17 --> 00:10:19,06
and should know john recruit was

114
00:10:19,06 --> 00:10:25,89
a normal week but i had to feed him.
It is then realised i had to be able

115
00:10:25,89 --> 00:10:32,14
to survive it was suffering when i just
can't work. I don't know some people are

116
00:10:32,14 --> 00:10:35,36
good people with families
were better off and

117
00:10:35,37 --> 00:10:40,49
a lot of life. Yes they were better off
just because so much for his child. I

118
00:10:40,49 --> 00:10:40,97
wouldn't you know

119
00:10:40,97 --> 00:10:48,09
a lot but so they got. And even
today the better off. Yes. Well

120
00:10:48,09 --> 00:10:48,45
no you

121
00:10:48,45 --> 00:10:52,06
a person who has lived through the depression
that was before the first world war

122
00:10:52,06 --> 00:10:56,11
in scotland and that was the worst. Yeah
as you know i asked when we were kids.

123
00:10:57,70 --> 00:11:03,34
There was nothing. You know we celebrate
can read and chat and of course my

124
00:11:03,34 --> 00:11:08,02
stepfather was on that i was there for you
had anything and he had if you were to

125
00:11:08,02 --> 00:11:13,81
go behind the fire. We had weather. And
all his own children were certainly over

126
00:11:13,81 --> 00:11:19,45
the mosel you know were starving. How much
old and where the sea had servants and

127
00:11:19,46 --> 00:11:25,26
you heard my mother and father. So that's
what i said to you know thirteen of yeah

128
00:11:25,26 --> 00:11:31,50
. There will be no job to find enough.
Well one or small i missed sister she was

129
00:11:32,37 --> 00:11:32,58
held as

130
00:11:32,58 --> 00:11:38,51
a brother left home when it was nothing
to him and their next one was killed and

131
00:11:38,51 --> 00:11:44,72
nine to fifteen and the others
were just we were all young then

132
00:11:45,96 --> 00:11:51,60
delivery of them die and if you children
die in that yes i wish to died.

133
00:11:52,95 --> 00:11:58,17
And was about to step step brothers and
sisters that he have them. Well even the

134
00:11:58,17 --> 00:12:04,96
state but i just saw none of us. The one
that died he was killed and now that the

135
00:12:04,96 --> 00:12:10,65
more and 1948 he was killed. So
none of that left four of us

136
00:12:12,19 --> 00:12:15,92
all of us to have the other family
died. The last time we have

137
00:12:15,92 --> 00:12:21,91
a tweet and then one died for her and how
did your mother manage to get enough food

138
00:12:21,91 --> 00:12:27,38
for the lot of you. I don't know what to
tell the truth. Did i say she did it all.

139
00:12:28,55 --> 00:12:32,03
She went out to work at you. Why she would
know that way. What did she do. She was

140
00:12:32,03 --> 00:12:37,95
i mean there and and for you. She went back
away. And so soon. When she was i mean

141
00:12:37,95 --> 00:12:42,63
babies. And when she was out of work.

142
00:12:46,24 --> 00:12:50,85
Did she get out of work at all during
the time. Well i see my mother had

143
00:12:50,85 --> 00:12:56,37
a baby about every teen months. Some of
them or let our team answer tween socio

144
00:12:56,37 --> 00:13:02,78
went to work whatever was our side
to look after the others. So how did

145
00:13:03,92 --> 00:13:09,36
. How old was the movie when she went out
of work i can tell you but i'm here to

146
00:13:09,36 --> 00:13:12,95
young for to worry about think about these
so i think if i don't know if she had

147
00:13:12,95 --> 00:13:19,57
one either. Every fifteen months or. I
think eighteen months is my story between

148
00:13:19,57 --> 00:13:25,91
anyplace. And she would actually went
out in between the boobies yeah yeah.

149
00:13:26,72 --> 00:13:31,54
This one just makes it

150
00:13:31,54 --> 00:13:35,99
a bit an awful lot more difficult in unity
you when you were out here and it was

151
00:13:35,99 --> 00:13:37,51
really hard. You were
living on nine shillings

152
00:13:37,51 --> 00:13:44,19
a week to hold up backing in scotland an
it all new england. It would be manchester

153
00:13:44,19 --> 00:13:49,14
your sister and sisters to just awesome.
Yeah in the depression of the thirties

154
00:13:49,14 --> 00:13:53,25
depression. You said there were living
on twenty sexual acts of work for

155
00:13:53,25 --> 00:13:58,10
a role that's what she said when she made
here she asked me if i'd ever live up

156
00:13:58,11 --> 00:14:04,08
there for him and i had ever lived on
twenty six and so weak. And i should have

157
00:14:04,08 --> 00:14:09,30
ever lived on nine years. She said no i
said well i have four years. And yet many

158
00:14:09,30 --> 00:14:14,20
people who have spoken about that depression
has been harder there than here and

159
00:14:14,20 --> 00:14:20,96
there with it. I can't see. Harder and i
sense you there's no comparison between

160
00:14:20,96 --> 00:14:25,99
that internet and now you know it was
so much harder growl mean everybody was

161
00:14:25,99 --> 00:14:27,23
hungry and when i was

162
00:14:27,23 --> 00:14:32,80
a kid and everybody was angry. There's i
mean to say that was the one that many

163
00:14:32,80 --> 00:14:39,36
jobs for anybody. They had to go
live to get any jobs. Just in

164
00:14:40,10 --> 00:14:46,85
and. And i know the imperatives are and
things are very bad and australia. Our

165
00:14:46,85 --> 00:14:52,05
tessanne hyde park london. We're exhorting
there and i'm pleased they're to fight

166
00:14:52,05 --> 00:14:56,47
like hell for their conditions. Otherwise
i'd be down to the conditions of the

167
00:14:56,47 --> 00:15:03,18
australian cooling coolie was the
name mentioned. Because here

168
00:15:04,23 --> 00:15:06,28
. Single men were getting
five and sixpence

169
00:15:06,28 --> 00:15:11,55
a week in england the dole in was twenty
two shillings per year but there's really

170
00:15:11,55 --> 00:15:16,80
say anything unless you do you can compare
the prices as well as it. Yes well i

171
00:15:16,80 --> 00:15:22,93
suppose. Well prices were very very
cheap very low in australia and

172
00:15:24,24 --> 00:15:30,39
i know bread was. Fourpence halfpenny alive
and things like that. I've heard of one

173
00:15:30,39 --> 00:15:31,16
of knight went through

174
00:15:31,16 --> 00:15:35,62
a side of land. Yes that would be
true too. And that would put rather

175
00:15:35,62 --> 00:15:41,09
a different complexion of. Oh well yeah.
But still five and sixpence. And the money

176
00:15:41,09 --> 00:15:42,16
wasn't there. It was only

177
00:15:42,16 --> 00:15:47,83
a paper coupon. Yeah and i can remember
that the paper coupon included one and

178
00:15:47,83 --> 00:15:54,07
threepence worth of meat and the rest was
spread between milk and groceries and it

179
00:15:54,07 --> 00:15:54,74
was a certainly

180
00:15:54,74 --> 00:15:59,34
a curvy standard of living and that's what
the orators used to say in hyde park i

181
00:15:59,34 --> 00:16:04,03
believe. Yeah right. Or you'll be down
to the standard of your story could be

182
00:16:06,78 --> 00:16:13,67
. I mean surely. Yes. I wonder if
your good friend you give me close

183
00:16:13,67 --> 00:16:20,16
for the baby you know all the
way to. Primary and longer then

184
00:16:21,72 --> 00:16:26,83
i know you have the thought of it. The
head no. You know the way they do it.

185
00:16:27,82 --> 00:16:34,40
Whatever the comparison to the day to
day. Comparison. I didn't 30s to do

186
00:16:35,99 --> 00:16:42,41
today. There don't know the meaning of going
hungry today. Children don't know the

187
00:16:42,41 --> 00:16:49,26
born. And you did you go hungry at all
during the depression here of the 1930s.

188
00:16:49,28 --> 00:16:56,00
Well as i we are nine children. Oh my.
I know arrived here and nine to twenty

189
00:16:56,99 --> 00:16:57,90
. Can see

190
00:16:57,90 --> 00:17:02,46
a fish and i weep. Well i prefer money
compared to what we've got. As i was worth

191
00:17:02,46 --> 00:17:06,71
it and i worked for eight
shillings for four years

192
00:17:07,67 --> 00:17:12,25
a five before the result we
have a go and i got my wages

193
00:17:12,26 --> 00:17:18,28
a person i had to spend on shoes.
That's one of my problems shoes

194
00:17:19,42 --> 00:17:24,45
and that's where my money went to show you
who you couldn't go anywhere. And when

195
00:17:24,45 --> 00:17:31,44
we landed here. We all had to pay and
when i was on the ship. I had no

196
00:17:31,44 --> 00:17:37,11
money at all. There was two friends at their
bank at the hear their member spin off

197
00:17:37,11 --> 00:17:42,40
and and that's what we had to land here

198
00:17:44,56 --> 00:17:48,81
when we landed here which of the tickets
to the church shop at the right. Give us

199
00:17:48,81 --> 00:17:53,96
a cup of tea in the centre so the way devil
you see and we didn't know where wide

200
00:17:53,96 --> 00:17:58,72
receiver wore where do walk all the way
and i looked for it and they chose us for

201
00:17:58,72 --> 00:18:02,23
showing me for a red not food just for

202
00:18:02,23 --> 00:18:06,70
a red. So that's when i learned that
i would like to go over it again.

203
00:18:09,94 --> 00:18:11,11
And i think you must receive a crew.
