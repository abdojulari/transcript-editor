1
00:00:40,99 --> 00:00:48,08
It's.

2
00:00:52,27 --> 00:00:56,10
Well you hear. A regular
washing day the petals.

3
00:00:56,21 --> 00:01:02,76
Yeah this is a you know do
a young child now so i do.

4
00:01:02,79 --> 00:01:05,40
Who are xing every few days nappies

5
00:01:05,40 --> 00:01:10,46
and stuff as you can see i've got
a sheen here and peter's been dry

6
00:01:11,66 --> 00:01:14,55
and ah you know of experimented with.

7
00:01:15,71 --> 00:01:20,21
With peter washing machines but i was
never terribly happy with them because.

8
00:01:20,23 --> 00:01:24,09
You couldn't walk away from it. You know
you were totally involved in a wash.

9
00:01:25,34 --> 00:01:28,85
And you had to be there for the
entire duration of the work so.

10
00:01:28,87 --> 00:01:32,12
With a 12 washing machine i can
just turn it on walk away.

11
00:01:32,81 --> 00:01:34,59
When the washing is
finished. I just come back.

12
00:01:35,87 --> 00:01:38,80
Take the washing the washing machine
strode into the pedal spin dry the pillows

13
00:01:38,80 --> 00:01:41,76
been dry as great because. I
just peddle it up to speed.

14
00:01:43,12 --> 00:01:45,19
Takes about 15 seconds people up to speed.

15
00:01:46,26 --> 00:01:51,13
Then you just as it's been an hour so
it's the pedal spend hours actually there

16
00:01:51,13 --> 00:01:56,01
with they the saving devices such as you
still doing yourself a lot easier than

17
00:01:56,01 --> 00:01:58,96
having to ring at all hours
you know works really well.

18
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,20
And you've also got this
legs in the business.

19
00:02:04,13 --> 00:02:08,18
Yeah well i've not peddling as
much as i used to having a family.

20
00:02:08,36 --> 00:02:08,81
I find

21
00:02:08,81 --> 00:02:14,72
that i can do all the shopping on the
bicycle so i tend to make use of a car

22
00:02:14,72 --> 00:02:16,85
and now i've got a car

23
00:02:16,86 --> 00:02:21,65
that runs on gas rather than petrol so it's
not as polluting as with most vehicles

24
00:02:21,65 --> 00:02:25,73
that. I am relying on on
the car to do shopping

25
00:02:25,73 --> 00:02:29,33
and stuff which i'm not getting
as much accessibility used to do.

26
00:02:30,95 --> 00:02:33,78
What other things. If you pedal.

27
00:02:35,00 --> 00:02:35,20
Here

28
00:02:35,21 --> 00:02:39,09
and i'll show you some of the stuff later i
got as you can see this is a people spin

29
00:02:39,09 --> 00:02:40,57
dryer and i'm the other side.

30
00:02:40,60 --> 00:02:44,15
They've got a multi-purpose pedal machine
a high speed better machine it's

31
00:02:44,15 --> 00:02:49,53
basically just a very clean
mounted check to a bench top

32
00:02:49,54 --> 00:02:56,15
and that's this spin dry here by
the way it's about 35 to 1 gear

33
00:02:56,16 --> 00:02:56,56
ratio.

34
00:02:56,61 --> 00:03:04,21
So every time the pedals go round once
this pin dry goes around 30 35 times.

35
00:03:04,23 --> 00:03:10,03
The the pedal the multi-speed the
multipurpose pair the machine i just told you

36
00:03:10,03 --> 00:03:12,08
about it's got a 70 to 1 gear ratio so.

37
00:03:12,54 --> 00:03:18,64
For every time that those go around once
in the check at the top spin 70 times.

38
00:03:18,65 --> 00:03:21,30
That means they say
pedaling at the rate of.

39
00:03:21,32 --> 00:03:25,29
A comfortable pedaling rate is probably
a hundred hundred twenty. P.m..

40
00:03:25,83 --> 00:03:29,46
That means that things doing that.

41
00:03:30,56 --> 00:03:37,13
Eighty eight thousand happy
im pretty good output.

42
00:03:37,57 --> 00:03:38,84
It works really well.

43
00:03:45,63 --> 00:03:49,81
Yes this is the the more the speed. Sorry.

44
00:03:49,98 --> 00:03:56,59
The more the purpose i see said i miss you
know something about you can see it's

45
00:03:56,59 --> 00:03:59,83
got 1 2 3 4 sets.

46
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,03
Chains on it so forth

47
00:04:02,03 --> 00:04:07,01
that the gearing to the speeded up from
the federales all the way up to the

48
00:04:07,91 --> 00:04:09,52
deserved apparat is at the top here.

49
00:04:10,75 --> 00:04:16,17
So this is giving me a 70 to 1
gear ratios are saying before they

50
00:04:16,17 --> 00:04:22,33
when i speed it up you can see it.
That's going it a hell of a speed now.

51
00:04:23,81 --> 00:04:27,01
I reckon i can get a probably
about ten thousand revs if i try.

52
00:04:29,92 --> 00:04:34,95
What sort of more forethought come out of
here sort of thing for years before this

53
00:04:34,96 --> 00:04:41,64
is what i've got on here at the moment
is a. Is a juicer blender base.

54
00:04:41,85 --> 00:04:44,03
So i can just with due to a
blender something on top of it

55
00:04:44,03 --> 00:04:48,58
but underneath here is there
is a vertically mounted.

56
00:04:48,59 --> 00:04:54,34
So i can put a check into take this
off. And put anything i like onto it.

57
00:04:54,47 --> 00:04:57,98
Too because it's. With
a very clean manager.

58
00:04:58,10 --> 00:05:04,04
You can get any say anything driven
by an electric motor let's say.

59
00:05:04,06 --> 00:05:08,12
Hopefully with a motor burnt out so you can
have a good excuse to pull the pieces.

60
00:05:09,67 --> 00:05:10,61
And you just keep at them

61
00:05:10,61 --> 00:05:14,22
or you strip the motor down until
you just left with it drives.

62
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:19,68
And you just insert the driveshaft into
the check shaven instantly turned used to

63
00:05:19,68 --> 00:05:24,08
be an electrical apparatus into
mechanically driven and this.

64
00:05:24,10 --> 00:05:28,49
What about the rest for house. Well.

65
00:05:28,51 --> 00:05:32,13
A lot of people seem to get the
idea when they hear about me

66
00:05:32,13 --> 00:05:33,57
that i run everything with pedal power

67
00:05:33,57 --> 00:05:40,37
but i don't i use pillow power mostly for
direct mechanical conversion like this is

68
00:05:40,37 --> 00:05:43,47
eastern machines of the show. Jr.

69
00:05:43,49 --> 00:05:48,53
Or my other power is just
battery based electricity.

70
00:05:48,55 --> 00:05:52,65
Got a bettery bank that's charged
by solar panels hydro system

71
00:05:52,65 --> 00:05:58,49
and a couple of small boats quinto bones.

72
00:05:58,50 --> 00:06:03,47
How long ago since. Your
pain lectures we built.

73
00:06:03,48 --> 00:06:08,50
G 20 years.

74
00:06:09,27 --> 00:06:11,66
I think i would have saved many
many thousands of dollars.

75
00:06:12,24 --> 00:06:17,43
And so do you develop
sort of prototypes here

76
00:06:17,43 --> 00:06:22,55
but eventually they end up in
products that our company.

77
00:06:22,57 --> 00:06:23,92
No i haven't done

78
00:06:23,92 --> 00:06:27,19
that for a while i have developed a
few prototypes quite some time ago

79
00:06:27,19 --> 00:06:28,42
but most of the research

80
00:06:28,42 --> 00:06:31,43
and development with around companies
now are done by other people.

81
00:06:31,46 --> 00:06:35,42
I tend to be full time involved
with that with writing stuff and

82
00:06:35,42 --> 00:06:42,26
and communicating with with
with clients and stuff.

83
00:06:44,67 --> 00:06:47,85
Yeah. I'm paid a peddles.

84
00:06:47,87 --> 00:06:52,26
I was instrumental in a whole lot of things
in the mean of course lately with the

85
00:06:52,26 --> 00:06:56,16
setting up were actually with the whole
concept behind the room but a company

86
00:06:56,99 --> 00:06:58,88
that was my idea back
in the early eighties.

87
00:06:59,77 --> 00:07:06,28
But before then i said a name
and film society in. You know.

88
00:07:06,68 --> 00:07:12,72
Established the no news which you
probably know about a local rag.

89
00:07:12,74 --> 00:07:18,10
And i was very instrumental in setting
up the what started off as being rainbow

90
00:07:18,10 --> 00:07:22,79
info which is now become the
number neighbourhood centre. So.

91
00:07:24,40 --> 00:07:27,90
Plus a lot of other things i
guess between in-between time

92
00:07:27,90 --> 00:07:40,78
and.

93
00:07:40,79 --> 00:07:42,10
Yeah.

94
00:07:43,37 --> 00:07:50,29
I was travelling overseas for a number
of years i came back to australia in 71

95
00:07:50,29 --> 00:07:51,46
72.

96
00:07:51,48 --> 00:07:54,62
And then i heard down the grapevine

97
00:07:54,62 --> 00:07:59,95
that there was a festival in the
offing in the nimbin area and i had a.

98
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,54
There's overseas i'd heard lots
about the woodstock festival

99
00:08:03,54 --> 00:08:06,83
and some big festivals in europe and
stuff and i thought this would be great.

100
00:08:06,83 --> 00:08:09,42
I wouldn't mind going to that festival.

101
00:08:09,44 --> 00:08:15,86
So i kept my ears to the ground and
found out exactly when and where it was

102
00:08:15,86 --> 00:08:22,01
and i think it was may 73 was when the
festival was held and i came up here

103
00:08:22,01 --> 00:08:24,90
and. Had a really great time and decided

104
00:08:24,90 --> 00:08:28,52
that this actually be the place
to live you know i travelled up

105
00:08:28,52 --> 00:08:32,32
and down the east coast of australia actually
traveled throughout most of australia

106
00:08:32,32 --> 00:08:37,50
and and with that with the idea of working
out where i'd really like to live

107
00:08:37,50 --> 00:08:41,16
and once i'd been at the festival he had
decided this would be the place for me so.

108
00:08:42,37 --> 00:08:45,72
I went away to sydney
for a few years to try

109
00:08:45,72 --> 00:08:52,70
and earn a lot of money to buy some land
and set myself up. Didn't get very far.

110
00:08:52,95 --> 00:08:55,03
Just the same

111
00:08:55,03 --> 00:08:59,83
or stories the more you earn them fast
you spend i decided to come back.

112
00:08:59,93 --> 00:09:03,31
Anyway after a couple of years
and and settled in here

113
00:09:03,31 --> 00:09:10,06
and then soon as i got here i may start
getting myself involved in community

114
00:09:10,06 --> 00:09:14,90
projects. When i was in
sydney i was involved with.

115
00:09:15,48 --> 00:09:18,50
Down to a drop in centre in paddington.

116
00:09:19,33 --> 00:09:22,64
And i did all sorts of things there
including showing films and stuff to people

117
00:09:22,64 --> 00:09:29,14
and i brought some projector equipment
stuff over with me up to nimbin

118
00:09:29,14 --> 00:09:33,08
and decided to start with
the set up a film club.

119
00:09:34,39 --> 00:09:36,92
In the film society.

120
00:09:38,88 --> 00:09:43,06
And i did that for quite some
time i was showing films.

121
00:09:43,08 --> 00:09:47,35
Every way for for a couple of years.

122
00:09:47,37 --> 00:09:51,97
And i found that there is very
poor communications in this area.

123
00:09:52,87 --> 00:09:56,27
And there's people. You know there's
lots of music museums in this area.

124
00:09:56,47 --> 00:10:01,67
Lots of people doing all sorts of
in the time. But most musicians.

125
00:10:01,69 --> 00:10:05,22
And i always found that there was
eight and nothing happening at all.

126
00:10:06,28 --> 00:10:07,68
Where everybody was doing their thing.

127
00:10:07,84 --> 00:10:09,04
All at the same time you know

128
00:10:09,04 --> 00:10:12,04
and it was always a great conflict
everybody wanted to get everything at once

129
00:10:12,04 --> 00:10:14,62
and of course some people ended
up missing out. And you know.

130
00:10:17,01 --> 00:10:21,26
And i thought oh this is crazy. We've got
to do something about this. So i set up.

131
00:10:22,81 --> 00:10:26,41
The no news actually stead
of being the no newsletter

132
00:10:27,39 --> 00:10:31,19
and i don't so as to drop off a letter
and just make the no news but that was

133
00:10:31,19 --> 00:10:34,77
that it was just starting off
as just a few new sheets.

134
00:10:34,86 --> 00:10:40,64
Giving information to people about
what's happening in the local area.

135
00:10:40,66 --> 00:10:43,09
And again

136
00:10:43,10 --> 00:10:47,42
that was something i did once a week every
week so since i got here i made myself

137
00:10:47,42 --> 00:10:49,93
pretty busy you know doing
all these things but

138
00:10:49,93 --> 00:10:53,62
that worked really well where we could had
a great following with an image and use.

139
00:10:54,99 --> 00:11:00,66
And all people were a lot better informed
about who was doing what and when

140
00:11:00,66 --> 00:11:06,05
and where and it was. I found there's
a lot less conflict as a result.

141
00:11:07,39 --> 00:11:08,45
And everybody really liked it.

142
00:11:09,54 --> 00:11:14,02
And then i went one step further and i
saw that i'd set up an office in town

143
00:11:14,79 --> 00:11:20,32
and just make that information
of not go that the rainbow info.

144
00:11:21,94 --> 00:11:27,11
And that i was involved in that
for a number of years as well.

145
00:11:28,44 --> 00:11:31,24
All of this was pretty well unpaid.

146
00:11:32,34 --> 00:11:38,65
And then the rainbow inso
started attracts some

147
00:11:38,65 --> 00:11:40,06
government funding

148
00:11:40,06 --> 00:11:46,31
and some of the government funding
attracted was neighborhood center funding

149
00:11:46,31 --> 00:11:50,33
and so we ended up changing the
name into the name and information

150
00:11:50,33 --> 00:11:54,17
and neighborhood center. Later
on i think the new information.

151
00:11:54,50 --> 00:11:59,17
Pat pretty well got dropped off and now
it's become the no neighborhood center so.

152
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,35
There's a number of projects that
i guess no things in them and

153
00:12:04,35 --> 00:12:07,55
that wouldn't have been there without if
they hadn't have been for me starting

154
00:12:07,55 --> 00:12:08,07
those things of

155
00:12:08,07 --> 00:12:20,31
that many years ago.

156
00:12:23,08 --> 00:12:28,07
I've always had a desire
to be self-sufficient

157
00:12:29,69 --> 00:12:33,19
and whenever that may mean.

158
00:12:33,21 --> 00:12:37,30
I mean as you get older and wiser you
realize that there's only so much

159
00:12:37,30 --> 00:12:39,89
that you can do and it's very hard.

160
00:12:40,24 --> 00:12:42,25
I mean it's impossible
even to be self-sufficient

161
00:12:43,21 --> 00:12:47,76
and have any kind of modern
technology around you you know.

162
00:12:47,77 --> 00:12:54,77
I guess even in all sorts of other aspects
we do need social interaction with

163
00:12:54,77 --> 00:13:00,85
people so i guess. The
concept of self-sufficiency.

164
00:13:00,94 --> 00:13:01,65
Depending on what

165
00:13:01,65 --> 00:13:05,32
but extent you want to take it if
you want to take it to the extreme.

166
00:13:05,35 --> 00:13:08,77
I guess it's just a pie in the sky. I don't
think anybody can really achieve that.

167
00:13:09,61 --> 00:13:13,65
But on the other hand we can be self-sufficient
to some extent you know we can own

168
00:13:13,66 --> 00:13:17,54
veggies. And we can do is
what i'm doing at home

169
00:13:17,54 --> 00:13:20,37
and what we're doing here is become
pretty well self-sufficient with our

170
00:13:20,37 --> 00:13:25,08
requirements. You can catch
your own rainwater of course.

171
00:13:25,10 --> 00:13:27,44
So there's all sorts of things
that you can do for yourself

172
00:13:27,44 --> 00:13:30,12
that don't require a lot of effort

173
00:13:30,12 --> 00:13:47,33
or sacrifice.

174
00:13:47,35 --> 00:13:51,22
About.

175
00:13:53,38 --> 00:13:59,28
12 years ago almost 10 living 12
years ago. I had the idea of.

176
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,32
Of setting up a company just an idea.

177
00:14:04,43 --> 00:14:07,76
There's a friend of mine doing
market research in nimbin.

178
00:14:08,29 --> 00:14:12,16
Which he was.

179
00:14:12,87 --> 00:14:13,92
Funded to do that

180
00:14:15,30 --> 00:14:20,50
and he invited me to join his
group to work on concepts of

181
00:14:22,16 --> 00:14:25,06
setting up different
things to make people.

182
00:14:25,58 --> 00:14:27,60
Less dependent on social security

183
00:14:27,60 --> 00:14:34,12
and hopefully employed
in some degree rather.

184
00:14:34,14 --> 00:14:39,50
And i then started working
on this idea i had and i put

185
00:14:39,51 --> 00:14:43,41
that into into this guy
submission and in that at

186
00:14:43,41 --> 00:14:49,13
that time i came up with the name
of the rain but our company.

187
00:14:49,73 --> 00:14:52,64
A lot of the concept behind
it and even the logo for

188
00:14:52,64 --> 00:14:58,38
that even design the logo for that stage.

189
00:14:59,18 --> 00:15:03,58
Now i think you'll find that there's some
record somewhere of of those submissions.

190
00:15:03,88 --> 00:15:07,94
But since then i'd spend last time
just talking to people there.

191
00:15:09,34 --> 00:15:14,47
And going around. Actually
doing some work in that area.

192
00:15:14,72 --> 00:15:18,85
I mean i've always been
interested in renewable energy.

193
00:15:19,36 --> 00:15:21,83
Federal power is one of these areas

194
00:15:21,83 --> 00:15:26,26
that i showed a lot of
interest in early on the face.

195
00:15:27,60 --> 00:15:32,22
When i found was that when people spoke
about renewable energy systems very often.

196
00:15:33,68 --> 00:15:39,16
Conveniently or otherwise. The idea of
human power was left out of the picture.

197
00:15:39,82 --> 00:15:44,25
And i thought this should really
sort of make a point with that and

198
00:15:44,25 --> 00:15:47,40
and try to demonstrate that you
meant there is actually something

199
00:15:47,40 --> 00:15:51,71
that ought to be considered is
very worthwhile considering.

200
00:15:51,72 --> 00:15:57,70
Particularly when you look at the
amount of time and money and effort

201
00:15:57,70 --> 00:16:00,65
that people put into. In the fitness.

202
00:16:01,52 --> 00:16:08,20
You know he's people buy expensive fitness
equipment to put into their own home.

203
00:16:08,21 --> 00:16:13,38
That they complain about the cost of
their electricity bills and whatever.

204
00:16:13,40 --> 00:16:19,30
They're they're spending a fortune on all
this labor saving equipment they've got

205
00:16:19,30 --> 00:16:22,17
around the house and then
they have in order to try

206
00:16:22,17 --> 00:16:27,92
and create time in order to spend time
with these fitness programs right.

207
00:16:28,04 --> 00:16:32,70
And i thought this whole concept is really
crazy it's all introverted to something.

208
00:16:33,37 --> 00:16:38,84
But we need to do you know what makes it
make a lot more sense is to have have the

209
00:16:38,84 --> 00:16:42,01
equipment that that that does your work

210
00:16:42,72 --> 00:16:45,20
and keeps you fit at the
same time you know so.

211
00:16:45,27 --> 00:16:47,54
So instead of buying
things three times over.

212
00:16:47,82 --> 00:16:51,94
You just just just spend all your
time in the one hit both being fit

213
00:16:51,94 --> 00:16:54,10
and doing your chores.

214
00:16:54,11 --> 00:16:57,74
And not having to complain about all
these electricity bills because you're

215
00:16:57,74 --> 00:17:07,15
creating your own energy to do so.

216
00:17:08,82 --> 00:17:14,92
Well i guess if if you're going to going
to spend a lot of time on fitness

217
00:17:14,92 --> 00:17:20,50
projects. You might as well. This
tour worthwhile children the process.

218
00:17:21,76 --> 00:17:24,22
It's just seemed to be.

219
00:17:24,71 --> 00:17:29,82
Perfectly sensible you know i don't know
if other people see the kind of logic

220
00:17:29,82 --> 00:17:34,74
that i've got the same so logical if
you're going to spend time doing it.

221
00:17:34,85 --> 00:17:41,38
Doing you know some fitness project and
then you my this will use the energy

222
00:17:41,38 --> 00:17:44,22
that you that you're generating
in this in this fitness.

223
00:17:44,59 --> 00:17:44,99
Thing

224
00:17:44,99 --> 00:17:55,49
that you're doing to do
it your at the same time.

225
00:17:56,31 --> 00:17:59,62
Well my concept of the
rain that our company was.

226
00:18:00,81 --> 00:18:05,59
Have a company first of all that
that employed people obviously.

227
00:18:05,61 --> 00:18:11,56
But a company where the employees the
employees were the decision makers.

228
00:18:13,03 --> 00:18:17,97
So i. I i like the idea of
having a company that was.

229
00:18:19,27 --> 00:18:24,44
I guess a bit of a co-operative
in some sense. So that.

230
00:18:25,29 --> 00:18:27,33
I didn't like the idea of having.

231
00:18:27,34 --> 00:18:32,66
Pyramid structures where you've got one
central manager or managing director

232
00:18:32,66 --> 00:18:36,24
or whatever. Passing down the
decisions all the way down the line

233
00:18:36,24 --> 00:18:40,19
and all the work is sort of slaving away

234
00:18:40,19 --> 00:18:42,26
and complaining about the whole structure

235
00:18:42,26 --> 00:18:44,09
and not being able to
do anything about it.

236
00:18:44,14 --> 00:18:47,38
I wanted to create a structure
that was was quite different.

237
00:18:48,44 --> 00:18:49,80
Where all the decisions were.

238
00:18:51,22 --> 00:18:56,33
Coming from from the grassroots up rather
than from the from the structure from the

239
00:18:56,33 --> 00:19:00,01
top down.

240
00:19:00,73 --> 00:19:06,58
Also wanted the company you know
the funds of the company to

241
00:19:07,60 --> 00:19:09,15
come from those workers as well.

242
00:19:10,39 --> 00:19:15,83
So and.

243
00:19:17,20 --> 00:19:24,07
As a company got set up now as as it
develops. We had a meeting. I was.

244
00:19:26,03 --> 00:19:29,26
You know as i've saying our go back to
the history bit a little bit more now.

245
00:19:31,44 --> 00:19:33,46
First of all i had this
concept an enlightened.

246
00:19:33,57 --> 00:19:38,55
There was a couple of people living
nearby who said why won't you just go

247
00:19:38,55 --> 00:19:43,97
and do something about it. So we put in
$30 a cheap place and bought some gear

248
00:19:43,97 --> 00:19:46,75
and started selling at local markets
under the banner of the rain

249
00:19:46,75 --> 00:19:51,67
that our company the company wasn't
it wasn't an official company as yet.

250
00:19:51,69 --> 00:19:54,64
They anyway that sort of spread the word.

251
00:19:54,66 --> 00:19:58,99
A lot better than just talking about
it and then a few years later.

252
00:19:59,30 --> 00:20:06,08
Actually it was. It's february of 87
that somebody else heard about it

253
00:20:06,08 --> 00:20:09,33
and said look let's let's actually
get the ball rolling properly now

254
00:20:09,33 --> 00:20:15,40
and call a public meeting. Meeting
was called in valley seven.

255
00:20:16,88 --> 00:20:23,42
To manage those factory in the. The
no neighborhood center as it was and.

256
00:20:23,44 --> 00:20:26,39
To.

257
00:20:27,14 --> 00:20:29,81
See if we could get all the
expertise all together

258
00:20:29,81 --> 00:20:33,60
and in the one place to
formalize the company properly.

259
00:20:33,62 --> 00:20:36,22
So we had the meeting and we found

260
00:20:36,22 --> 00:20:40,76
that all the required skills
row there at the meeting

261
00:20:40,76 --> 00:20:42,34
and everybody's really
keen to go on with it.

262
00:20:43,39 --> 00:20:49,14
So we actually decided to set up a company

263
00:20:50,34 --> 00:20:54,89
and in of july 7. We had
the company registered.

264
00:20:55,30 --> 00:20:57,99
And in august of 87 we
set up shop in nimbin

265
00:20:57,99 --> 00:20:59,92
and since then we've never looked back.

266
00:21:01,02 --> 00:21:05,20
I mean yeah we've just just
gone from good to bare

267
00:21:05,20 --> 00:21:15,18
that you know.

268
00:21:17,02 --> 00:21:23,74
Well to start with we were selling
mostly just reselling. You know just.

269
00:21:23,76 --> 00:21:26,28
Which there are still
resellers here now that we've

270
00:21:26,28 --> 00:21:30,98
but through through this time i guess our
products have been become a lot better

271
00:21:30,98 --> 00:21:36,43
researched. To start with.

272
00:21:38,30 --> 00:21:44,62
We had some of their own product not many
but just things like control boards.

273
00:21:44,64 --> 00:21:47,18
We did make our own
regulators from million face.

274
00:21:47,63 --> 00:21:54,10
We made their own rechargeable torches
right from the beginning. And then we.

275
00:21:54,85 --> 00:21:59,32
Right at that meeting of
february 7 i told you about be.

276
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,68
Decided then that one of the products
that we really got a way to get up

277
00:22:03,68 --> 00:22:06,06
and running was the the hydro.

278
00:22:07,63 --> 00:22:12,00
Taught me of the idea of the
micro-hydro electric system.

279
00:22:12,02 --> 00:22:13,44
So we put a lot of effort into

280
00:22:13,44 --> 00:22:18,21
that to actually be able to come up
with a good product in the statue.

281
00:22:20,10 --> 00:22:26,58
But it still took us almost a year before
we actually got our first first ones.

282
00:22:26,60 --> 00:22:28,80
On the showroom floor

283
00:22:28,80 --> 00:22:43,01
and ready for sale.

284
00:22:43,03 --> 00:22:49,04
Well i've i guess i've
always been into making.

285
00:22:50,37 --> 00:22:53,76
Things public you know as
with a company we don't like.

286
00:22:54,86 --> 00:23:00,37
And we don't really endorse
the idea of copyright

287
00:23:00,37 --> 00:23:04,53
and of patenting you know that's the stuff.
We tend not to patent anything here.

288
00:23:05,47 --> 00:23:11,17
We just like. Things to be
public knowledge and and.

289
00:23:11,18 --> 00:23:15,71
To be out in the public arena so to speak.

290
00:23:17,19 --> 00:23:18,25
So.

291
00:23:18,27 --> 00:23:24,19
As i said i've often been writing material
with the view of publishing a just to

292
00:23:24,19 --> 00:23:26,53
make all this information
also public knowledge.

293
00:23:28,73 --> 00:23:32,67
And we wanted to be able to produce
a catalog for the for their own

294
00:23:32,67 --> 00:23:35,78
that our company just a show will
show people with the product

295
00:23:36,92 --> 00:23:39,52
but we didn't wanted to just be a catalog.

296
00:23:39,61 --> 00:23:44,42
We wanted it to be a lot more than that.

297
00:23:45,38 --> 00:23:49,83
We wanted it to be a handbook you
know so that people could read it

298
00:23:49,83 --> 00:23:51,15
and could learn from it themselves.

299
00:23:51,66 --> 00:23:58,22
Of how to do all this stuff for themselves
without having to to employ some expert.

300
00:23:58,24 --> 00:24:04,00
You know. To do all this stuff or.

301
00:24:04,02 --> 00:24:06,20
You know the thing with.

302
00:24:06,21 --> 00:24:07,87
Low voltage systems is

303
00:24:07,87 --> 00:24:13,94
that you don't need to have have a
qualified person to install it for you.

304
00:24:15,33 --> 00:24:20,31
Seriously anybody can install their own
level the system because there's really no

305
00:24:20,31 --> 00:24:21,81
danger great danger involved.

306
00:24:22,19 --> 00:24:22,99
The biggest danger

307
00:24:22,99 --> 00:24:27,36
that you possibly may have is the
possibility of setting your house in fire

308
00:24:27,36 --> 00:24:30,89
but if you do it properly and you
put fuses in your system and stuff

309
00:24:30,89 --> 00:24:33,63
and it's not going to happen anyway so.

310
00:24:33,65 --> 00:24:43,26
We thought oh this is a great opportunity
to do to keep the tower with the people.

311
00:24:43,27 --> 00:24:44,42
And.

312
00:24:45,16 --> 00:24:50,39
Just remind me of john
lennon song about it but.

313
00:24:51,64 --> 00:24:54,71
You know the idea of have you know of
making the skills available to everybody.

314
00:24:55,03 --> 00:24:59,11
So i started to write the
book with a view of it.

315
00:24:59,21 --> 00:25:02,73
Starting off with a view of being
the rainbow tower company catalog

316
00:25:02,73 --> 00:25:06,01
that i thought would be
a lot more than that.

317
00:25:06,03 --> 00:25:07,15
So i wrote it in a way

318
00:25:07,15 --> 00:25:13,16
that you don't need any fantastic skills
to understand it you know written in

319
00:25:13,16 --> 00:25:18,46
layman's language so
that anybody with with.

320
00:25:18,48 --> 00:25:23,71
Just the basics of primary school
education could understand the book

321
00:25:23,71 --> 00:25:28,42
and with any kind of skills are
doing anything for themselves.

322
00:25:28,80 --> 00:25:33,46
You know they should be able to
put up their own power system.

323
00:25:34,47 --> 00:25:40,56
So that book was finally ready in.

324
00:25:42,02 --> 00:25:47,71
I guess in that much the same time as
either system was was it shopfloor.

325
00:25:48,82 --> 00:25:50,65
And immediately was a great success.

326
00:25:51,49 --> 00:25:52,66
That was our first edition

327
00:25:52,66 --> 00:25:59,24
when our 6 edition with in
the meantime we've sold.

328
00:25:59,25 --> 00:26:03,56
13. Thousands of them. So.

329
00:26:03,58 --> 00:26:06,43
And it was selling fast
and fastest and goes on.

330
00:26:06,43 --> 00:26:16,53
So it's a it's turned out
to be a very popular book.

331
00:26:16,55 --> 00:26:22,00
The company was. As you'd expect.

332
00:26:22,36 --> 00:26:25,09
Of course when we first opened up shop in.

333
00:26:25,11 --> 00:26:31,84
In august of 87 which we hardly making
enough money just to support one person.

334
00:26:32,56 --> 00:26:33,83
But.

335
00:26:35,59 --> 00:26:38,46
The word soon spread that we were there

336
00:26:40,11 --> 00:26:46,39
and. The strange thing
with the figures but.

337
00:26:47,98 --> 00:26:52,41
In the first year i think we made
a hundred thousand or something.

338
00:26:52,44 --> 00:26:53,73
I think turned over.

339
00:26:55,48 --> 00:27:00,34
But since then we've been growing at the
rate of 45 to 50 per cent per annum right

340
00:27:00,35 --> 00:27:04,31
up until last year we slowed
down a bit in the last year

341
00:27:04,31 --> 00:27:07,56
but it looks now actually that
we stand to take off again.

342
00:27:08,63 --> 00:27:12,85
So it was a growth rate of
40 to 45 percent per annum.

343
00:27:12,86 --> 00:27:15,14
For four years in an slowdown and

344
00:27:15,14 --> 00:27:17,23
that looks like we're
probably going to go back up

345
00:27:17,23 --> 00:27:21,46
that same growth rate which
makes it very difficult

346
00:27:21,46 --> 00:27:25,16
that kind of growth rate because
it's like trying to run

347
00:27:25,16 --> 00:27:26,61
when you've had to learn to crow.

348
00:27:27,07 --> 00:27:30,42
You know and that's the way the
company has been going all along.

349
00:27:31,54 --> 00:27:34,90
You know now we're
employing about 20 people.

350
00:27:34,92 --> 00:27:38,09
We've got a turnover of well in excess
of a million dollars a year now

351
00:27:38,09 --> 00:27:42,14
and i think that will probably hit
at least one half million this year.

352
00:27:44,82 --> 00:27:51,21
And mr. growing we've set up another
company called reshape which is.

353
00:27:52,18 --> 00:27:58,17
So reshape is our overseas marketing
company. And we say that.

354
00:27:59,39 --> 00:28:00,82
We've. We predict

355
00:28:00,82 --> 00:28:03,61
that reshape is going to really take
off in the next couple of years

356
00:28:03,61 --> 00:28:09,67
and it reshape is going to far
exceed sales within australia.

357
00:28:10,67 --> 00:28:12,64
At present. We're showing australia wide

358
00:28:12,64 --> 00:28:16,38
but once once the overseas market
really starts to take off.

359
00:28:16,49 --> 00:28:16,82
I think

360
00:28:16,82 --> 00:28:21,36
that the sales in australia is only going
to be a drop in the bucket as compared

361
00:28:21,36 --> 00:28:22,54
her sales overseas.

362
00:28:23,44 --> 00:28:24,57
I can say we're going to go through

363
00:28:24,57 --> 00:28:35,05
and number of really
huge growth spurts yet.

364
00:28:36,14 --> 00:28:40,05
One of the problems with promoting
renewable energy in australia is

365
00:28:40,05 --> 00:28:45,29
that people need to know about most
other people there in remote areas

366
00:28:46,71 --> 00:28:50,01
and the greatest difficulty is marketing

367
00:28:50,01 --> 00:28:56,61
and advertising to remote areas is
very easy to do to make it to a city

368
00:28:56,61 --> 00:29:00,65
suburban environment but.
As it stands at the moment.

369
00:29:00,95 --> 00:29:08,15
That's not where our our sales lie
ourselves you know i think for instance.

370
00:29:09,10 --> 00:29:14,01
If you look at home states.
Cattle stations etc..

371
00:29:14,47 --> 00:29:19,79
A lot of them are running on
very big diesel generators.

372
00:29:19,81 --> 00:29:23,53
And in this day and age and
saying that they should rely.

373
00:29:24,18 --> 00:29:31,08
For all their power on diesel fuel being
exported to transport all over the country

374
00:29:31,08 --> 00:29:36,28
for them. And the same of
course is the same idea.

375
00:29:36,31 --> 00:29:43,01
Holds true for. Countries
overseas you know. When.

376
00:29:45,03 --> 00:29:50,57
When we have any kind of.

377
00:29:51,67 --> 00:29:55,47
Overseas aid programs in invariably what

378
00:29:55,47 --> 00:29:59,85
but they give to these people overseas
is diesel generators and to me.

379
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,45
It's totally insane. You know these people
can't afford to buy the days of foreign.

380
00:30:04,87 --> 00:30:07,49
And usually what happens is i
mean it makes people feel good

381
00:30:07,49 --> 00:30:12,30
that senator them you know maybe also
wonderful tax dodging all sorts of stuff

382
00:30:12,30 --> 00:30:13,96
but it's no use to these people at all.

383
00:30:14,74 --> 00:30:17,88
You know first of all they don't have the
mechanical skills to maintain you quick

384
00:30:17,88 --> 00:30:23,46
meant. And secondly that you
know in small pacific islands

385
00:30:23,46 --> 00:30:29,00
or remote areas southeast asia
wherever you're talking about.

386
00:30:30,99 --> 00:30:36,17
It's just too expensive for them to get
a d or they just can't afford it. So.

387
00:30:38,22 --> 00:30:38,79
We need to.

388
00:30:40,23 --> 00:30:44,86
You know it's makes a lot more sense to
in these areas to have renewable energy

389
00:30:44,86 --> 00:30:48,68
systems. You know once the system is
up and running it maintains itself.

390
00:30:49,01 --> 00:30:54,20
You know you put a solar panel out
in the sun and you know it it all.

391
00:30:54,97 --> 00:30:58,53
Have the capability of charging a
battery for the next 30 years and.

392
00:30:58,83 --> 00:31:02,16
You know without doing anything too
if you don't there's no moving parts

393
00:31:02,16 --> 00:31:05,94
and you don't have to maintain you think
there's nothing to fix anything you just

394
00:31:05,94 --> 00:31:08,27
placed in the sun connect the
battery to it in a battery

395
00:31:08,27 --> 00:31:10,95
or just keep on being
charged both right so.

396
00:31:11,55 --> 00:31:17,70
So in remote areas of australia
and anywhere else in the world.

397
00:31:17,85 --> 00:31:22,61
I guess it just makes so
much more sense to. To have.

398
00:31:23,20 --> 00:31:25,14
Energy systems that that detect.
