1
00:00:15,70 --> 00:00:18,11
Tell you know about it around a
strange thing that happened.

2
00:00:18,15 --> 00:00:24,16
Carry am i the re left your
you can we went to g guy

3
00:00:24,16 --> 00:00:29,60
and we played in the new bananas
and neighborhood heroin.

4
00:00:29,62 --> 00:00:33,64
I'm telling him about how it
happened but the other 10.

5
00:00:33,76 --> 00:00:39,33
The other owners of the lane wouldn't
sign eruption. He said he said.

6
00:00:40,35 --> 00:00:44,38
Life is a way of taking care of itself
because something might happen to them to

7
00:00:45,13 --> 00:00:50,10
this and i might lose a child or
brother and sister might die.

8
00:00:50,11 --> 00:00:53,36
And i thought that was
rather strange thing to say

9
00:00:54,63 --> 00:01:01,60
but i me a very short time
after runnable children like

10
00:01:01,61 --> 00:01:04,51
this brink and was i
know my way was killed

11
00:01:05,76 --> 00:01:09,99
and about five years later one
of her brothers died of cancer.

12
00:01:12,33 --> 00:01:19,18
And i thought i had when i was a coincident
with them and. That is really true.

13
00:01:21,29 --> 00:01:27,56
Bring on tell me about your
wedding day. Well the moral.

14
00:01:28,00 --> 00:01:33,43
But we need a house that wasn't painted
and we were going to have the reception

15
00:01:34,97 --> 00:01:37,80
or not actually the reception
the reception was held in town

16
00:01:37,80 --> 00:01:42,93
but later we were going to go to work to
home to my place of course very thought

17
00:01:42,93 --> 00:01:45,83
i'd describe all the laws
down with hot water inside so

18
00:01:45,83 --> 00:01:49,15
that everything was shown in plain sight.

19
00:01:49,15 --> 00:01:55,10
I'm awaiting that mother it was that
cried you that he now live. But anyway.

20
00:01:55,19 --> 00:01:59,50
Great all that money and light a
long right prop for me nicely.

21
00:02:01,85 --> 00:02:07,50
We've got married at the cathedral
on the 9th of october 1944.

22
00:02:08,38 --> 00:02:12,91
Then after that we went to a boarding
house not a mrs. no he had reached st..

23
00:02:13,73 --> 00:02:15,88
And she gave us the reception there.

24
00:02:17,37 --> 00:02:21,04
But of course you couldn't stay there
for too long and in those days.

25
00:02:22,14 --> 00:02:24,14
The customer just started up on night

26
00:02:24,14 --> 00:02:27,71
and didn't go home so
we went on to my place

27
00:02:27,71 --> 00:02:32,97
and home of course we had a lot more
things to read and everything out there.

28
00:02:33,58 --> 00:02:39,37
Dear do you remember who know you it
with the prayer the praise from the

29
00:02:40,75 --> 00:02:45,19
girl and god because we were
in his parish bad about. Here.

30
00:02:46,10 --> 00:02:49,34
So we didn't go home till the
next day and the next day

31
00:02:49,34 --> 00:02:54,25
when you didn't have a utility or anything
so my brother in law took me home

32
00:02:55,47 --> 00:03:02,46
and you hear about all that happened and.

33
00:03:03,35 --> 00:03:07,12
What kind of civilities did
you have at the rating

34
00:03:07,12 --> 00:03:08,93
or were kind of here's a guy we had

35
00:03:08,93 --> 00:03:15,63
and yes we had mr. morality
and i forget his name now.

36
00:03:15,69 --> 00:03:19,95
He played little him beautifully involved
it's going to sydney made a living.

37
00:03:21,34 --> 00:03:26,65
Deal directly played the more i mean he
also played beautifully not he have since

38
00:03:27,64 --> 00:03:32,07
died. Yes and it was dancing we had a
veranda so we had everything set up

39
00:03:32,07 --> 00:03:34,82
and then marina and food in.

40
00:03:34,84 --> 00:03:39,55
That your family your mother and your
family prepared here in back here by day

41
00:03:39,55 --> 00:03:43,41
but but actually the running back was
right in town when we went to miss it.

42
00:03:43,52 --> 00:03:49,19
And i think it was sort of a carry on
because it was raining but this was it.

43
00:03:49,33 --> 00:03:51,56
Lunch time we got married in the morning.

44
00:03:52,17 --> 00:03:56,74
That was all the custom in any writing and
then sort of you went on to the night

45
00:03:56,74 --> 00:04:02,73
and the night we had a meal and then you
were up on. Right now it will be no party.

46
00:04:02,82 --> 00:04:09,65
Can you know. How on earth where you are
a bit exhausted after our surprise you.

47
00:04:09,67 --> 00:04:11,73
Were but. Everybody did

48
00:04:11,73 --> 00:04:16,17
that you know you know sort of
it may not do what you know

49
00:04:16,17 --> 00:04:18,28
but gradually all that's come to now

50
00:04:18,28 --> 00:04:20,96
and younger generation
cannot actually i think

51
00:04:20,96 --> 00:04:23,85
when you get a great
military gotten our time

52
00:04:23,85 --> 00:04:28,89
and you don't have to rewin if you
don't want to danger one for a lot

53
00:04:28,89 --> 00:04:34,92
but first coming at my
kids get older i think.

54
00:04:34,94 --> 00:04:38,85
I think some of the bigger
ratings are getting to be.

55
00:04:38,87 --> 00:04:42,46
And you can meet everybody
and that i think

56
00:04:42,46 --> 00:04:48,78
that is one of the reasons why i don't
mind such an enjoyment in a big wedding

57
00:04:48,78 --> 00:04:52,21
years and the other end of the sky
where it's so expensive. T.j.

58
00:04:52,21 --> 00:04:57,73
To me to do anything that's
right. The ratings at home.

59
00:04:57,77 --> 00:05:01,08
I think been four months of flight.

60
00:05:02,54 --> 00:05:06,50
But that's just what kind of station
my. What kind of food. Did you.

61
00:05:06,83 --> 00:05:11,91
Did you prepare for the morning breakfast
would have been a four course meal you

62
00:05:11,91 --> 00:05:16,66
would have started with on try which was
probably salami and quarter of an egg

63
00:05:16,66 --> 00:05:20,03
and a slice is a matter of
like a cucumber slice of ham.

64
00:05:21,28 --> 00:05:22,85
Weapon or less young try

65
00:05:22,85 --> 00:05:27,49
but you went on to say chicken soup which
you know you know then you went on to

66
00:05:27,49 --> 00:05:30,42
broach it which was with.

67
00:05:31,18 --> 00:05:36,03
More vegetables sort of mashed potatoes
and pumpkins and things like that

68
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:39,54
when you had your roast chicken
which went with back the taliban.

69
00:05:41,21 --> 00:05:45,40
And i think they had lettuce
with it whatever baggage double

70
00:05:45,40 --> 00:05:48,28
and then you had your swedes.

71
00:05:50,59 --> 00:05:52,96
And.

72
00:05:53,89 --> 00:05:58,86
Brain about brought libya to australia where
rights again he was the eldest of the

73
00:05:58,86 --> 00:06:04,78
family. And it was not actually
expected but merely because

74
00:06:04,79 --> 00:06:09,32
that wasn't enough for everybody
to live on love a lot

75
00:06:09,32 --> 00:06:13,97
and the older men of the time you might
try to twist drag canada a lot of other

76
00:06:13,97 --> 00:06:20,07
places thoroughly define the word lucky
inasmuch as he's had his uncle jack parent

77
00:06:20,07 --> 00:06:26,28
here and he came out and virtually
all he would work for different.

78
00:06:26,30 --> 00:06:31,20
Families. He got a pound a
week and tobacco and balls

79
00:06:32,26 --> 00:06:36,38
that i used to pay my way by and i had
to read through some lot of times

80
00:06:36,38 --> 00:06:41,43
but for that. I mean it
wasn't. And you come to. Yes.

81
00:06:41,46 --> 00:06:44,23
You came straight to me is more
fun to take in this new me

82
00:06:44,23 --> 00:06:51,14
and i don't think he had been here a
long time he came probably about 25

83
00:06:51,14 --> 00:06:54,02
26.

84
00:06:54,04 --> 00:06:58,40
If he'd like to write either
the eventual border out

85
00:06:58,40 --> 00:07:00,35
that aunty island was here

86
00:07:01,19 --> 00:07:05,32
and kind which made it a lot
easier because bees are the ones

87
00:07:05,32 --> 00:07:10,19
that came after i had you know a lot easier
if you can call it a little because.

88
00:07:10,57 --> 00:07:12,56
When i think of the first bananas

89
00:07:12,56 --> 00:07:19,61
that we eventually have to perhaps
they would be was behind he had.

90
00:07:20,87 --> 00:07:27,64
A cancer. Probably but there were books.
And his name in this name with the book.

91
00:07:27,67 --> 00:07:33,80
So he had probably something behind it.

92
00:07:33,85 --> 00:07:35,09
I think he had to do that.

93
00:07:36,11 --> 00:07:41,79
I mean every time into the
writing that it had a thought.

94
00:07:42,60 --> 00:07:49,21
And then i painted the bananas i need to
believe a little very quick and easy.

95
00:07:49,22 --> 00:07:54,70
Others are an ellipsis if you play on when
we rebuild our house. The second time.

96
00:07:54,85 --> 00:07:59,84
Uncle jack's feet win by the wind. I wouldn't
spit it out they clearly got the axe.

97
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,75
If you have prodded and knighted
fed by running like a good idea.

98
00:08:04,77 --> 00:08:09,80
You know industries. Have
things like time you know.

99
00:08:09,82 --> 00:08:14,72
But you need to he went on being
a boy he had a lot more liberty

100
00:08:14,72 --> 00:08:19,82
and i did so he went to the apollo the
damn thing was quite a good game to move a

101
00:08:19,82 --> 00:08:23,36
bit harder and even going straight
up stating things straight.

102
00:08:23,42 --> 00:08:26,52
Chillin and with the riviera
which is damn near be.

103
00:08:28,13 --> 00:08:33,62
The river a cop a man with that it
ain't home here so it was a game.

104
00:08:34,36 --> 00:08:39,74
To me and i had the federal budget which i
think it's been too i went to the motel.

105
00:08:40,01 --> 00:08:40,40
Anyway.

106
00:08:41,40 --> 00:08:46,82
Yes the world is changing prices could
probably store also be able to drive the

107
00:08:46,82 --> 00:08:50,71
host to other places today.
But of course i didn't.

108
00:08:50,73 --> 00:08:55,07
I didn't do any of that and i
will know in the future on

109
00:08:55,07 --> 00:08:59,86
that island damn thing i did about
came in and i would love to learn it.

110
00:09:00,76 --> 00:09:02,07
But i knew that i wouldn't be alive.

111
00:09:03,18 --> 00:09:06,94
And if my mother had heard about it
you know they've been mine for what.

112
00:09:08,28 --> 00:09:13,27
I did didn't do it and the things
that you can do when you're young

113
00:09:13,27 --> 00:09:18,15
and you really want to do that. Not to
lose your system. You still have to be me.

114
00:09:18,35 --> 00:09:23,86
So when i got our older kids grow
up i didn't go out very much at all

115
00:09:23,86 --> 00:09:29,75
when my kids were growing up you know
around i went to the tryst with the best of

116
00:09:29,75 --> 00:09:31,35
them and.

117
00:09:31,37 --> 00:09:32,50
The media hype of it

118
00:09:32,50 --> 00:09:37,84
but never 90 years to get up there
were i had big sisters been offended.

119
00:09:38,52 --> 00:09:43,26
Did live near her apartment which was
there any other relatives in australia

120
00:09:43,26 --> 00:09:46,31
or about came out to australia a lot at

121
00:09:46,31 --> 00:09:50,46
that time no light around
played around like a man

122
00:09:51,17 --> 00:09:55,64
and his brother in law came out his brother
came out too liberal for a visit to me

123
00:09:56,41 --> 00:10:00,48
and i came out to lead me to them and
i did the same. Things are time.

124
00:10:00,66 --> 00:10:01,17
James in the know

125
00:10:01,17 --> 00:10:07,58
and carried on the side of it he did he
have many of the family left in italy.

126
00:10:09,04 --> 00:10:14,77
As he has a sister two sisters and brother
one of his sisters in the twin sister

127
00:10:14,77 --> 00:10:19,20
and she the one cheating on as well. Yes.

128
00:10:21,12 --> 00:10:25,02
And actually she's come to be to
business driving a car and she.

129
00:10:26,81 --> 00:10:32,67
But that's about all the general these
people have to say you know after the war.

130
00:10:32,69 --> 00:10:36,56
Things changed in italy. And.

131
00:10:36,58 --> 00:10:40,74
Not exactly trying to write because a
lot of migrants came out just like the

132
00:10:41,97 --> 00:10:46,76
italians but even 10 to 15 years
things changed for the better.

133
00:10:47,87 --> 00:10:50,46
And when we went back in 78.

134
00:10:50,75 --> 00:10:53,74
Everyone was really living well and
his brother had a lovely home.

135
00:10:54,33 --> 00:11:01,22
Nima thinks possibly with all these people
leaving the gap ability answer the ones

136
00:11:01,22 --> 00:11:02,67
that were left to make it a little.

137
00:11:04,06 --> 00:11:08,00
So living at anything that one
standard time you went back.

138
00:11:09,75 --> 00:11:12,63
And he was terrified that you can label.

139
00:11:13,21 --> 00:11:16,93
Drop me in any street in my little
home town and i know where i am

140
00:11:16,93 --> 00:11:21,06
and i kept telling him it's changing
it's changed he said i'm not where i am

141
00:11:21,06 --> 00:11:24,32
and you're right i mean women
just couldn't believe it.

142
00:11:25,15 --> 00:11:27,94
Big factories and sprang
up and there was nothing.

143
00:11:29,29 --> 00:11:34,95
There was only one real place the good
still there and we went to visit them.

144
00:11:34,98 --> 00:11:36,56
It was a mix of surviving.

145
00:11:38,08 --> 00:11:39,94
Which wasn't very far from where i lived

146
00:11:39,94 --> 00:11:44,72
and i still have our big kitchen where they
used to have a sealed room in the film

147
00:11:44,72 --> 00:11:49,98
room and by have the stables and
i saw that because backside

148
00:11:49,98 --> 00:11:53,53
or not i never seen my life in
that time we wouldn't believe

149
00:11:53,53 --> 00:11:59,65
that she was it not been
a very emotional trip.

150
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,72
When you know whether it was for him

151
00:12:02,72 --> 00:12:07,59
but it wasn't for me because i
didn't remember it but you know.

152
00:12:07,61 --> 00:12:13,62
I didn't remember anything but it
was very bad news. Uncle. So yeah.

153
00:12:13,63 --> 00:12:17,89
It would have been for him and also
strangely enough one of the things

154
00:12:17,89 --> 00:12:24,72
that hit him most was that a lot of his age
had died really through. During a boy.

155
00:12:26,30 --> 00:12:31,91
Like not a lot actually. During the
war years but later. You know 60 65.

156
00:12:31,93 --> 00:12:33,47
My dad he's right.

157
00:12:33,60 --> 00:12:38,28
He had very few make left when there
are younger you know and i don't know.

158
00:12:39,66 --> 00:12:44,53
But it was a fact and they're
thinking it also changed kerry

159
00:12:44,53 --> 00:12:47,78
and i couldn't really
relate to them at all.

160
00:12:47,93 --> 00:12:51,08
Must be a driving me mad because

161
00:12:51,08 --> 00:12:55,64
when you know every nationality
has their own mentality.

162
00:12:56,12 --> 00:13:00,73
Mine was really i think the
big news was too and by

163
00:13:00,73 --> 00:13:02,85
that time i guess we had a change.

164
00:13:03,11 --> 00:13:04,65
It was it was where we were born

165
00:13:04,65 --> 00:13:09,94
and you always have a certain sympathy for
a place where you know it wasn't home.

166
00:13:10,16 --> 00:13:14,14
You know i know we had you know
which were very much a return.

167
00:13:14,16 --> 00:13:16,36
Was not to be it really beautiful.

168
00:13:16,39 --> 00:13:19,61
So if you have a good chance
you mean it is beautiful

169
00:13:20,59 --> 00:13:26,17
and could you speak the dialect of
these families to spiteful dialect you

170
00:13:26,17 --> 00:13:29,30
understand that you. And control you

171
00:13:29,30 --> 00:13:31,94
and the way they are could
speak enough to get by.

172
00:13:32,88 --> 00:13:38,45
You know living like the same dialect
very close in a few words very close.

173
00:13:39,96 --> 00:13:41,82
Yes and cans weren't very far apart.

174
00:13:42,24 --> 00:13:43,86
When you first met

175
00:13:43,86 --> 00:13:47,79
and in the early days of you marriage
what did you speak may need hammering

176
00:13:47,79 --> 00:13:50,85
that it was behind me tell you
and tell the children came

177
00:13:50,85 --> 00:13:56,60
and really want to learn to
speak english so that then.

178
00:13:56,62 --> 00:13:59,73
When you were speaking english
to them they were answering me.

179
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:00,07
Yes

180
00:14:00,07 --> 00:14:05,32
but i suppose we tap into the current lie
ranging in english far better than years

181
00:14:05,32 --> 00:14:10,38
went by by actually doing very little now
i must have to they can speak italian.

182
00:14:10,79 --> 00:14:14,65
If i have to tell you i can't
but if i have too many real.

183
00:14:14,74 --> 00:14:20,60
Yeah but i can understand it all i can
remember media here at home talking to ron.

184
00:14:20,62 --> 00:14:21,63
In english.

185
00:14:21,70 --> 00:14:25,38
You know trying to explain something to
them and he couldn't get the right word

186
00:14:25,38 --> 00:14:29,41
but not quite in the tongue and.

187
00:14:29,43 --> 00:14:34,78
And ron could understand it perfectly.

188
00:14:36,20 --> 00:14:43,01
Yeah yeah. After the. The the landslide.

189
00:14:43,07 --> 00:14:44,97
You have on that piece of mind

190
00:14:44,97 --> 00:14:49,53
that you know originally wanted to be in
the house i read it in any yes we were

191
00:14:49,53 --> 00:14:54,11
made for a good few years came and went
to school and we brought a little horse

192
00:14:55,43 --> 00:15:00,57
and she used to ride to school
each horse being like grownups.

193
00:15:02,17 --> 00:15:06,51
And when my brother in law came out
from a plane he thought i can ride

194
00:15:06,51 --> 00:15:09,93
but horse of any little pony you know
we said look at all but we were off

195
00:15:09,93 --> 00:15:11,96
and he said you gotta be kidding you know.

196
00:15:12,46 --> 00:15:15,51
It's a lot but i don't get there
anything on the ships right off of him.

197
00:15:15,69 --> 00:15:19,75
John ballard. So he got on
an after but five seconds

198
00:15:20,60 --> 00:15:22,75
but they only went on these hope not that

199
00:15:22,75 --> 00:15:25,39
that any evidence could
do anything with it.

200
00:15:25,45 --> 00:15:30,74
She was a very good little ride and
we stayed there for a few years

201
00:15:30,74 --> 00:15:35,20
but the bananas weren't very good position
which we are not in the beginning

202
00:15:35,20 --> 00:15:38,93
that we couldn't get anything
else but we decided to try

203
00:15:38,93 --> 00:15:42,94
and buy some land of our own because
it was still very hard to rent

204
00:15:42,94 --> 00:15:48,94
and we boarded i found it with
100 like a fan. Trying it.

205
00:15:48,94 --> 00:15:50,47
Craig between trying you
click on the channel.

206
00:15:51,84 --> 00:15:57,60
And my husband and my brother
most to get there first and

207
00:15:57,60 --> 00:15:59,87
that this time we didn't have
to shift the house goes.

208
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,64
It had a very large have been a very solid
team i had about would have been about

209
00:16:06,81 --> 00:16:13,63
40 feet long and the boards were
right with us. And joining them.

210
00:16:14,77 --> 00:16:15,92
It was a very very solid

211
00:16:15,92 --> 00:16:21,88
and it had verandas all around which the
rain had the parish to be had to have a

212
00:16:21,88 --> 00:16:23,99
very solid.

213
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:29,69
So we made that there and we
stole the original little house

214
00:16:29,69 --> 00:16:36,13
and i think actually i think it got
shifted once again no and but it remained

215
00:16:36,14 --> 00:16:40,68
and they are sentimental about that
and rely for the poor little thing

216
00:16:40,68 --> 00:16:44,46
and been through much of the bible

217
00:16:45,22 --> 00:16:50,01
but i did so with plan and some
bananas there was a few planted

218
00:16:50,01 --> 00:16:51,16
when we bought the place

219
00:16:51,16 --> 00:16:57,50
and we planted mormon on it being the two
we had to have a bigger a creature in the

220
00:16:57,50 --> 00:17:01,42
nana's one sometimes that would cry
sometimes. And so we had planned.

221
00:17:01,73 --> 00:17:07,81
Like i think it was quite literally
a good between us and that meant

222
00:17:07,81 --> 00:17:14,72
that we had to plan. Was very rocky and.

223
00:17:16,81 --> 00:17:20,01
On this path that we had eventually but.

224
00:17:20,03 --> 00:17:24,93
My brother and my brother my brother in
law immediate fans and i had half each

225
00:17:25,70 --> 00:17:29,48
and we planned it again on
this rocky part of the time.

226
00:17:31,14 --> 00:17:32,97
And it does not really
a very good bananas.

227
00:17:33,26 --> 00:17:37,85
To cover so rocky that we had to my
groom to plan for the nannies or

228
00:17:37,85 --> 00:17:43,40
when the suckers came up and just an
ordinary cold i wasn't strong enough.

229
00:17:43,42 --> 00:17:45,89
So libya had to use the actual drink.

230
00:17:47,05 --> 00:17:49,25
And it come home and evander be a king and

231
00:17:49,25 --> 00:17:53,56
that is to say i think i've got
cancer in me arms and if so that.

232
00:17:53,58 --> 00:17:59,22
The spring cart accelerator case was on
our ride so it was very hard it was very

233
00:17:59,22 --> 00:17:59,70
rocky.

234
00:18:02,36 --> 00:18:06,71
When we used to have a horse a tiger
understand with a horse the slab first

235
00:18:06,71 --> 00:18:12,85
but then we got a bit of money so we bought
a little caterpillar tractor which is

236
00:18:12,85 --> 00:18:17,96
really a lie like the cracks like a
little caterpillar hannibal very small

237
00:18:19,03 --> 00:18:22,25
and it was my job to drive
it to take the bananas in

238
00:18:23,01 --> 00:18:29,41
and also help libya clear the land he would
have these big bushes of lantana he'd

239
00:18:29,41 --> 00:18:34,68
crawl under and put a chain under it and
i drove it up so we cleared all this up

240
00:18:34,68 --> 00:18:38,28
and paper all up. You know like.

241
00:18:38,30 --> 00:18:40,02
Grass lane for the cattle

242
00:18:41,26 --> 00:18:45,17
and one particular day i remember
i don't know what we were doing.

243
00:18:45,19 --> 00:18:51,44
Probably pulling the antenna and i was
driving as usual and for some reason.

244
00:18:52,50 --> 00:18:57,26
The cracks on the caterpillar
tractor pulled a stone out

245
00:18:58,37 --> 00:19:02,82
and head on top of another stone with
children that was killed at the tractor

246
00:19:04,25 --> 00:19:08,89
and it was on the side of a hill and
i could just see the trap and going.

247
00:19:08,91 --> 00:19:15,60
And i heard they jump and of course i
jumped across the narrow can jump up hill.

248
00:19:15,62 --> 00:19:22,28
So i jumped down hill. I jumped off but
thankfully. Thank god to check the storm.

249
00:19:22,29 --> 00:19:24,46
Otherwise it would have
rolled on it couldn't miss

250
00:19:26,85 --> 00:19:32,98
and not got any right you could open very
close then we had the pushing back by the

251
00:19:32,98 --> 00:19:38,25
iron bar and got it off. It was very very
closely as though he thought he saw me.

252
00:19:38,27 --> 00:19:43,17
Especially when he said jump and
i went down here well it wasn't.

253
00:19:45,29 --> 00:19:46,37
But only right. Went on

254
00:19:46,37 --> 00:19:49,81
and we kept on clearing i don't know probably
didn't die because of the got scared.

255
00:19:50,02 --> 00:19:56,68
But anyway. Kept going and then
after we decided that we'd try

256
00:19:56,68 --> 00:19:59,27
and get a dairy farm down there it.

257
00:20:00,93 --> 00:20:03,44
Because the banana's are still too small

258
00:20:03,44 --> 00:20:07,32
and we thought the pairing it
would be at an income strata rise

259
00:20:07,32 --> 00:20:12,41
and i'm given a list take to come to a
month is back from a new plan to the tune

260
00:20:12,41 --> 00:20:13,31
the 18 months

261
00:20:13,31 --> 00:20:18,34
that the first budget the never very
big is a book so we would have planned

262
00:20:18,34 --> 00:20:22,92
and beans in between with
that said gradually will be

263
00:20:22,92 --> 00:20:24,63
that built up to hurt anyone

264
00:20:26,47 --> 00:20:31,79
and we milked for about seven
right years and then at

265
00:20:31,80 --> 00:20:33,93
that time we were still
with my brother in law

266
00:20:33,93 --> 00:20:37,65
and my brother in law got an irate
loan them ripping down my hand to know

267
00:20:37,65 --> 00:20:41,21
that we had a little bit machines which
you know yes we have a little bit machine

268
00:20:41,21 --> 00:20:45,95
how many towns. We would have
making 70 or 80 some times.

269
00:20:46,04 --> 00:20:52,26
What time is in mourning which is dialogue
that i think we do. We've got a bit.

270
00:20:52,28 --> 00:20:56,11
I don't think we've got up in the
dark very much was usually dialogue.

271
00:20:57,33 --> 00:21:00,69
And of course it was the sister in
law and i did the milking then not

272
00:21:00,69 --> 00:21:04,25
and you know they were at the farm but
in between we still worked on the farm.

273
00:21:05,43 --> 00:21:11,06
We had to chip in and get out the
house and chip on the grass comey

274
00:21:11,07 --> 00:21:12,11
that chipping the grass

275
00:21:12,11 --> 00:21:18,27
and the world who were in the spray at
all in those days of red have to chip.

276
00:21:18,35 --> 00:21:22,75
But with a had a chip on the manana in
between the nana's with the high road which

277
00:21:22,75 --> 00:21:26,22
looking back now. At the
wrong thing to do all

278
00:21:26,22 --> 00:21:30,39
that we didn't have to scratch much in the
beginning because when you move that.

279
00:21:30,76 --> 00:21:32,78
Topsoil next round. It
could get washed away.

280
00:21:34,31 --> 00:21:37,01
Whereas if you spray the soil
would be wouldn't be useless.

281
00:21:38,61 --> 00:21:42,92
So a lot of the topsoil would have been
washed right especially on the hill.

282
00:21:42,93 --> 00:21:46,22
But of course we didn't know
that the time we didn't think

283
00:21:48,59 --> 00:21:50,97
that within the milking and
i remember one morning.

284
00:21:52,13 --> 00:21:54,25
To be looking machines had been playing up

285
00:21:56,22 --> 00:21:59,68
and it broke the suction wouldn't.

286
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,23
Ok so they actually machines would
fall off if you put them on the couch

287
00:22:04,23 --> 00:22:05,58
and it was a little plug.

288
00:22:05,95 --> 00:22:09,06
Under a tube that way that would
have to be put in by hand.

289
00:22:10,68 --> 00:22:13,30
And so this time it happened
and i thought i'll take that.

290
00:22:15,20 --> 00:22:18,46
I have a twitch the machines are
and then when i get it right.

291
00:22:18,71 --> 00:22:20,96
He tricked it on the glide.

292
00:22:20,98 --> 00:22:25,32
But you never leave it but i
had put my arm fell away and

293
00:22:25,33 --> 00:22:31,52
when it turned up on the real ramp forcibly
my arm was strong enough to stop the

294
00:22:31,52 --> 00:22:32,58
real from spinning.

295
00:22:32,90 --> 00:22:37,72
Otherwise it would have just thrown
my hand a bit in and i chatted up.

296
00:22:38,34 --> 00:22:43,16
In the thought of coming to see me he did
shut it down just automatically so i

297
00:22:43,16 --> 00:22:47,77
broke my arm and i had
but you broke your arm.

298
00:22:48,20 --> 00:22:54,12
You have a broken both me and but it
only by one band you know on the side

299
00:22:54,13 --> 00:22:58,01
but i have to have an
entire amount of course

300
00:22:58,01 --> 00:23:03,10
that many difficulties of going to
because at the same time i have loved

301
00:23:03,11 --> 00:23:10,00
and suffered from back like it is by the
way my brother in law who was there at the

302
00:23:10,00 --> 00:23:11,13
time got shingles.

303
00:23:11,26 --> 00:23:17,04
So he couldn't hear them talking
with my hand me my last one here

304
00:23:17,04 --> 00:23:20,68
and i managed to i managed
to learn i was quite good.

305
00:23:20,87 --> 00:23:24,84
Compare it with the one hand you
know and my sister and i carried on.

306
00:23:26,41 --> 00:23:27,68
There were no children at this time.

307
00:23:27,79 --> 00:23:31,44
Yes i tell you if i had
two children just didn't

308
00:23:31,44 --> 00:23:36,73
but i had to guess who was born at
that at this stage but they had both

309
00:23:36,73 --> 00:23:39,72
and i've got a children wrong.

310
00:23:39,74 --> 00:23:46,71
But george you can get anyone in the
still no water and ron was born writer.

311
00:23:47,51 --> 00:23:51,77
How many children altogether
i mean to and having to you.

312
00:23:52,66 --> 00:23:54,90
I always wanted for you know i said.

313
00:23:54,92 --> 00:23:59,88
But i don't think i could have coped not
right chad had a table ready to have it.

314
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,18
Probably lazy. To have never had times
when times and yes they were hard times.

315
00:24:06,98 --> 00:24:10,76
Lots of outside work to do and i
mean if you didn't make a living.

316
00:24:10,78 --> 00:24:12,81
You couldn't go on social
service like you do now.

317
00:24:12,84 --> 00:24:16,00
You know you just carried
on like god no god

318
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:20,54
and i brought the children go to school

319
00:24:21,34 --> 00:24:26,76
but i haven't started it but you go on and

320
00:24:26,76 --> 00:24:31,87
and then she went on to george you
got to not george you've got to try

321
00:24:31,87 --> 00:24:34,22
and you create him run went
to train your pre-school.

322
00:24:34,28 --> 00:24:35,10
Yes

323
00:24:35,10 --> 00:24:41,14
and then on the high school in the snow he
made money which me about yeah which me

324
00:24:41,14 --> 00:24:44,20
really really the only high
school around in hard times.

325
00:24:44,59 --> 00:24:47,22
Yeah about where they are but i got there.

326
00:24:48,54 --> 00:24:51,36
Well i think that limit was
called believing in the ground.

327
00:24:51,43 --> 00:24:54,46
It was called a high school
certificate in the correct meaning.

328
00:24:54,64 --> 00:24:57,36
Yes the talk about how many years between

329
00:24:58,26 --> 00:25:02,33
and nearly seven years right on the big
there's a big here i have a little problem

330
00:25:02,33 --> 00:25:05,00
in between me.

331
00:25:06,30 --> 00:25:10,85
But at night writing running because
that was a really little monetary.

332
00:25:10,86 --> 00:25:14,58
Yes you know she was really really
good with him which helped me.

333
00:25:15,31 --> 00:25:18,15
And where did i leave now challenging god.

334
00:25:18,59 --> 00:25:22,03
The main down there for you
know the schoolteacher

335
00:25:22,03 --> 00:25:28,10
that used to be trying to create
change married him and run. Right.

336
00:25:28,10 --> 00:25:33,20
Rather we're very lucky with one is here
with us now because this energy left

337
00:25:33,20 --> 00:25:37,99
school he went to sydney for four
years and when he was down there.

338
00:25:38,38 --> 00:25:41,67
He got married when he was
down there and i got it went.

339
00:25:41,70 --> 00:25:44,57
When danny wife went down
with him for about six

340
00:25:44,57 --> 00:25:46,80
or eight months then i got a chance

341
00:25:47,80 --> 00:25:50,11
but the boys he was working
for bought a shop in town

342
00:25:50,11 --> 00:25:55,38
and said could they come back they could
come to work if they wanted to world you

343
00:25:55,38 --> 00:25:56,42
couldn't keep a brick.

344
00:25:56,50 --> 00:25:59,82
She rang a mother she rang everybody they
were coming back to leave my weekly.

345
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:02,69
Like please know that's why he came back.

346
00:26:03,23 --> 00:26:09,69
Much of the class a rep sydney
pinkham team would like straight

347
00:26:09,69 --> 00:26:16,14
kind of a shop as it was obvious
machine me going. Yeah that's what.

348
00:26:16,64 --> 00:26:17,92
We come. He came back.

349
00:26:18,04 --> 00:26:23,58
Otherwise we wouldn't have been paid because
now we've got the granddaughters you

350
00:26:23,58 --> 00:26:26,85
know which is great for coming to handle
it. How many grandchildren all together.

351
00:26:29,79 --> 00:26:34,33
And the same three girls you
never know and not have the boys

352
00:26:35,70 --> 00:26:40,48
and ever anything else. And yes that
will be well now you have been told

353
00:26:40,48 --> 00:26:43,27
and yes i have an intelligence
you know training.

354
00:26:44,26 --> 00:26:47,33
She trained when we are going
to school just to teach

355
00:26:47,33 --> 00:26:53,59
and i think i think it's good. I
don't know in the 20 big school.

356
00:26:53,64 --> 00:26:57,10
I'm not sure i forget
names came in i think

357
00:26:57,10 --> 00:27:01,50
and i teach at the school i went
to you know you go girl. I mean.

358
00:27:02,85 --> 00:27:07,02
And you know i think everyone these coachable
school kids will be the big school

359
00:27:07,02 --> 00:27:10,52
would have been at the school even then
it's a catholic school they work with

360
00:27:10,52 --> 00:27:13,87
really the catholic school but then
i would say that more right hatred.

361
00:27:14,67 --> 00:27:16,66
There was no way than now. You know.

362
00:27:17,11 --> 00:27:23,71
Here and around them and even
understanding they say they you know.

363
00:27:24,97 --> 00:27:25,70
Bring a hammer.

364
00:27:25,85 --> 00:27:32,56
You know to rainier creek for about
17 years by then a children at school

365
00:27:37,08 --> 00:27:43,08
where we decided to move into
town. The year was 1970.

366
00:27:44,80 --> 00:27:46,93
But mikel coming in 100 started.

367
00:27:47,25 --> 00:27:51,07
I really didn't like farm work i never
liked grammar but much actually.

368
00:27:51,24 --> 00:27:52,00
But i try

369
00:27:52,00 --> 00:27:57,38
and get a job in town which i did have
a balance factory which was then any i

370
00:27:58,12 --> 00:27:59,77
but i think give them a call to.

371
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,83
The apparel so many i used
to work on means trousers.

372
00:28:04,90 --> 00:28:11,40
I stayed there for about eight years which
helped us a lot because even though the

373
00:28:11,40 --> 00:28:15,92
rain is wasn't very much
terrorist or money coming in

374
00:28:17,87 --> 00:28:22,09
and returning after about three
months after we moved in libya

375
00:28:22,09 --> 00:28:29,09
but really played up on him and he had to
have an operation on the discriminant.

376
00:28:29,11 --> 00:28:31,86
And he couldn't for over a year.

377
00:28:33,03 --> 00:28:36,66
So here i was with the bananas
to work a job at the factory.

378
00:28:36,76 --> 00:28:42,66
I didn't really give me back the job
because we needed the money so i would be

379
00:28:42,66 --> 00:28:47,17
working the bananas that
weekend we had more than jay

380
00:28:47,17 --> 00:28:48,52
but if you had bought in shape.

381
00:28:48,80 --> 00:28:51,34
So why don't they run gary
out from friday night

382
00:28:52,61 --> 00:28:55,17
and cut the man on the
sideline pat them on the sun

383
00:28:55,17 --> 00:29:00,50
and take the mean then leave
them here till the tuesday

384
00:29:00,50 --> 00:29:02,38
when they would go right on the train

385
00:29:03,22 --> 00:29:08,26
but i used to be a shame to drive the bananas
in the jeep with the banana kaiser i

386
00:29:08,26 --> 00:29:13,91
thought public. Park at a fair right from
the factory many my lunch right over

387
00:29:13,91 --> 00:29:20,43
and take them bananas and i like
them and then come home so i did

388
00:29:20,43 --> 00:29:24,51
that for a long. Then
eventually my brother in law.

389
00:29:26,50 --> 00:29:30,55
There's one day i remember
particularly well it was pouring rain.

390
00:29:32,06 --> 00:29:34,89
And maybe had told me not to put logan 21

391
00:29:34,89 --> 00:29:39,58
or 20 10 cases on the trial behind the
crawler tractor because it had missed it was

392
00:29:39,58 --> 00:29:42,97
still heavy and i had about 30 cases.

393
00:29:42,99 --> 00:29:48,70
It was trikes on the heart so i didn't want
to make a trip. So i loaded the moron.

394
00:29:49,13 --> 00:29:52,21
And as i'm going down the hill.

395
00:29:52,23 --> 00:29:56,75
Tractor slipped a little bit and one of
the tracks went out by using the garage

396
00:29:56,75 --> 00:29:59,59
and it's done and done it before
then you get with a crowbar.

397
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:02,65
Just go backwards and
forwards until i went back in

398
00:30:03,37 --> 00:30:07,44
but there i am on a fairly steep hill
30 cases of bananas on the trailer

399
00:30:08,88 --> 00:30:14,20
and i think i said. God help
me. And i backed the tractor.

400
00:30:14,22 --> 00:30:16,76
And it went in by itself
which you'd never.

401
00:30:16,96 --> 00:30:19,32
I mean i had to do it
with a line behind it.

402
00:30:19,39 --> 00:30:23,58
So i took the man who lives in the mine
not have to allow them onto the gate then

403
00:30:23,58 --> 00:30:27,97
from me in coming to town
which went on for a would be.

404
00:30:29,48 --> 00:30:32,63
The media heavy heavy.
Operation after that.

405
00:30:32,77 --> 00:30:37,89
And i can remember i used to come
in every night to visit him.

406
00:30:37,91 --> 00:30:39,85
Give me he was clean.

407
00:30:40,03 --> 00:30:45,49
Could you come in the game saturday
night and i could have cried.

408
00:30:45,50 --> 00:30:48,30
Because other side time
and i'd never been lower.

409
00:30:48,35 --> 00:30:51,66
And i had a club that i don't need to
see sometimes have his team is good.

410
00:30:52,49 --> 00:30:53,72
Sorry within parramatta.

411
00:30:55,34 --> 00:31:00,36
And one day they have tractions on him
to try and give him but they don't

412
00:31:00,36 --> 00:31:04,58
and they just couldn't do it
so i saw the doctor that time

413
00:31:04,58 --> 00:31:07,61
and i think a lot could be david he
said be anything is an operation.

414
00:31:08,54 --> 00:31:13,77
So we have the operation which did
read him but like much better after

415
00:31:13,77 --> 00:31:19,42
that he couldn't bend over
for long but he could work.

416
00:31:19,54 --> 00:31:24,51
He was just about all the time you ended
up getting a job in his machinery which he

417
00:31:24,51 --> 00:31:29,72
wouldn't be a problem for
it over ten years and

418
00:31:30,55 --> 00:31:34,87
that sort of we went on from may
have been an eventual i didn't work.

419
00:31:36,81 --> 00:31:42,59
I actually wrote the year we decided to get
weebly to go back to italy can then we

420
00:31:42,59 --> 00:31:48,66
went to bat then we both maybe would
write and we had a sound of time

421
00:31:48,66 --> 00:31:55,57
when we came to with the time
wasn't sound for a bad father six

422
00:31:55,57 --> 00:32:02,16
years i think when we sell the farm
and bought him an exact duplicate it.
