1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:08,51
Well our next speaker is Professor John Hirst John Hirst is a historian and scholar of America's tripe University.

2
00:00:08,77 --> 00:00:12,89
He was founded convener of the astray and Republican movement in Victoria

3
00:00:12,89 --> 00:00:20,63
and a member of the prime minister Keating's Republic advisory committee not in ninety three for the Howard Government

4
00:00:20,63 --> 00:00:27,23
he was chair of the civics education group which oversaw the preparation of materials for the discovering democracy

5
00:00:27,23 --> 00:00:33,37
program in schools. He has written books on convicts the origins of democracy a New South Wales.

6
00:00:33,4 --> 00:00:42,06
Albert Facey Federation and the Republic. He was CO What it coeditor of The Oxford Companion to a strange history.

7
00:00:42,21 --> 00:00:47,63
His most recent books a sense and not since in a strange history two thousand and six.

8
00:00:47,85 --> 00:00:49,97
The Australians insiders

9
00:00:49,97 --> 00:00:54,73
and outsiders on the national character since seventeen seventy which appeared in two thousand

10
00:00:54,73 --> 00:00:58,09
and seven the shortest history of Europe two thousand

11
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:04,24
and nine which has been translated into I clanged which is at the strength history and seven questions.

12
00:01:04,43 --> 00:01:09,68
Twenty four tane. He's going to be talking to us to die.

13
00:01:09,7 --> 00:01:21,63
On the subject of British rights and liberties in Australia and I'd like you to welcome John Hirst thank you.

14
00:01:22,34 --> 00:01:27,89
Thank you. British rights and liberties in a strike.

15
00:01:27,9 --> 00:01:37,31
In nineteen fifty Robert Menzies angle of file excellence planned an attack on British rights and liberties.

16
00:01:37,33 --> 00:01:44,46
To counter the threat of communism. He proposed that communists could be declared such by executive act.

17
00:01:45,15 --> 00:01:53,92
The onus of proof was to be reversed. So that the clay and person had to prove they were not communists.

18
00:01:53,94 --> 00:01:58,48
And the decision on whether they were Communists was not to be made by a jury.

19
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:07,7
The Libre position that under suspicion because of its connections to communists in the trade union movement had an

20
00:02:07,7 --> 00:02:14,45
easy task in opposing Menzies they denounced the UN British of his measures

21
00:02:15,28 --> 00:02:21,3
and trumpeted the principles of British justice. Dr Evatt SHADOW ATTORNEY GENERAL.

22
00:02:21,41 --> 00:02:28,84
Declared that a bill of this character would never get a moment's consideration in the matter of parliaments at

23
00:02:28,84 --> 00:02:31,59
Westminster. The Bill.

24
00:02:31,64 --> 00:02:32,86
Nevertheless passed

25
00:02:33,63 --> 00:02:42,2
but the measure was declared unconstitutional by the High Court Menzies then Hill a constitutional referendum to give

26
00:02:42,2 --> 00:02:46,37
the Commonwealth the path to ban the Communist Party.

27
00:02:46,39 --> 00:02:54,62
If it led the movement for the no vote in the literature prepared for the referendum campaign in the light the party

28
00:02:54,62 --> 00:03:00,96
proclaimed that it stood for British justice and as the protector of Magna Carta and the rule of law.

29
00:03:03,37 --> 00:03:07,52
Whatever Magna Carta is real position in a strike in law was at that time

30
00:03:07,52 --> 00:03:09,88
and we're going to hear more about that later today.

31
00:03:10,83 --> 00:03:14,03
It was still a potent symbol of British rights

32
00:03:14,03 --> 00:03:22,58
and liberties it played a bit part in undoing of Menzies attempt to ban the Communist Party.

33
00:03:23,79 --> 00:03:24,07
If it's

34
00:03:24,07 --> 00:03:33,93
when in the no case was the high point of his career even though he had other claims to find as an historian jurist.

35
00:03:34,29 --> 00:03:38,06
And as a founder of the United Nations as one of the founders

36
00:03:39,82 --> 00:03:45,01
when he was a judge of the high court in the nine hundred thirty S. He published his most influential book.

37
00:03:45,41 --> 00:03:55,81
The ram rebellion an account of the overthrow of govern apply in eighteen a light previously Blyde being regarded as a

38
00:03:55,81 --> 00:03:59,56
tyrant. If it wanted to overturn that few.

39
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:07,24
And persuade his readers that the governor was using his powers properly to stamp out the monopoly of the military

40
00:04:07,24 --> 00:04:09,53
offices in the trade in RUM

41
00:04:10,71 --> 00:04:17,69
and so support the small farmers who were the victims of the offices stranglehold on the colony.

42
00:04:19,13 --> 00:04:25,42
The introduction to the book began with the words used by John MacArthur the leader of the rebellion in writing to his

43
00:04:25,42 --> 00:04:29,24
wife after the rebellion was excessively accomplished.

44
00:04:31,25 --> 00:04:37,01
I have been deeply engaged all this day contending for the liberties of this unhappy colony

45
00:04:37,9 --> 00:04:46,86
and I am happy to say I have succeeded beyond what I expected the tyrant is now no doubt gnashing his teeth with

46
00:04:46,86 --> 00:04:52,24
vexation at his overthrow the purpose of ever spoke.

47
00:04:52,71 --> 00:05:02,77
Was to show how folks in so those words were the introduction proceeded to castigate all the historians who had been

48
00:05:02,77 --> 00:05:08,87
gulled by McCarthy if it was particularly separate on Roderick Flanagan.

49
00:05:09,48 --> 00:05:16,44
Who had published his history of New South Wales in one thousand nine hundred sixty two Flanagan concluded that this

50
00:05:16,44 --> 00:05:24,85
rebellion against Bligh. Had some similarity to the rebellion that gave in England Magna Carta or all of ends.

51
00:05:25,07 --> 00:05:31,57
If Blodgett knock it did not occupy a position similar to that of King John MacArthur the officers

52
00:05:31,57 --> 00:05:39,81
and their adherence occupied a situation similar to that of the barons on that interpretation.

53
00:05:39,85 --> 00:05:43,76
If it heat or scorn at his command.

54
00:05:45,48 --> 00:05:46,46
The battle between Bligh

55
00:05:46,46 --> 00:05:54,82
and his opponents was fought out in the courts with the officers composed the juries if it used his legal skills to

56
00:05:54,82 --> 00:05:59,69
support his thesis that vested economic interests success.

57
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:07,41
He defied the governor's Bly end his predecessors because they had the monopoly not only of wealth and violence

58
00:06:07,41 --> 00:06:18,81
but also of justice the American scholar hotly gratin in his forward to the book drew out the full implication of

59
00:06:18,81 --> 00:06:25,25
evidence arguments in Marxist tunes the officers women AAPL us

60
00:06:26,16 --> 00:06:34,46
and die with the dominant class the law is a superstructure of society raised on economic foundations which inevitably

61
00:06:34,46 --> 00:06:41,05
precipitate social struggles in the 1940's fifty's and sixty's

62
00:06:41,94 --> 00:06:45,81
when Marxists interpretations were very strong in the academy.

63
00:06:46,38 --> 00:06:50,84
Everts book was hugely influential Angus

64
00:06:50,85 --> 00:07:00,48
and Robertson reprinted it six times I was introduced to it at the University of Adelaide in one hundred sixty two the

65
00:07:00,49 --> 00:07:08,93
other thesis has since been demolished first by Roger Hines Worth who showed that the offices monopoly had long since

66
00:07:08,93 --> 00:07:12,07
passed with the arrival of a Mensa posts

67
00:07:12,07 --> 00:07:20,69
and free immigrants into the commercial world then by all of that concern who showed that there was why does my among

68
00:07:20,69 --> 00:07:25,5
the townsfolk of Sydney at Bligh's determination to knock down houses

69
00:07:26,61 --> 00:07:35,09
and make Sydney conform to govern the Philips plans for that guy the leaders of the rebellion a popular following a

70
00:07:35,09 --> 00:07:41,38
genuine one. Finally that talented pay at Richard Waterhouse and Grice caskets.

71
00:07:41,82 --> 00:07:45,47
Have depicted Bligh's setting himself against all the freedoms

72
00:07:45,47 --> 00:07:51,64
and securities the opportunities in enterprise of a thriving commercial colony

73
00:07:52,46 --> 00:07:57,99
and wanting it to take it back to the self-sufficient peasantry of the original plan.

74
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,65
If it does deal with blah's plans for Sydney he sees virtue in Bly conforming to Philip's plans

75
00:08:06,65 --> 00:08:09,26
and nothing wrong in removing houses

76
00:08:09,26 --> 00:08:16,68
when there was no good title to them it is true that townsfolk occupied their sites informally

77
00:08:17,48 --> 00:08:25,3
or on a lease held at the will of a government but they might still have thought that they are home was their castle.

78
00:08:26,84 --> 00:08:28,83
This does not occur if it.

79
00:08:30,18 --> 00:08:37,67
He does not see that a governor declaring a house must be destroyed would seem as arbitrary as the astroid in

80
00:08:37,67 --> 00:08:45,27
government declaring a person to be a communist some account as opposed to his wife.

81
00:08:45,29 --> 00:08:55,45
That he preserve the liberties of the colony no longer seems as self-serving to us as it did to have it undoubtedly the

82
00:08:55,45 --> 00:08:57,59
colonists convict's included.

83
00:08:57,97 --> 00:09:01,03
Thought of themselves as possessing rights

84
00:09:01,03 --> 00:09:07,66
and liberties which had nothing to do with the current form that the government of the colony took.

85
00:09:09,2 --> 00:09:14,37
Just because there was a very powerful governor and just because there was no parliament

86
00:09:14,37 --> 00:09:22,49
or a representative assembly that did not take everything else away the rule of law more

87
00:09:22,49 --> 00:09:29,99
or less operated in New South Wales everyone charged before a court was innocent until proved guilty

88
00:09:31,41 --> 00:09:37,99
and in the higher courts convictions coming from juries albeit compose for the moment of the offices.

89
00:09:39,88 --> 00:09:43,84
Sadly this was not known to the designers of the monument to Magna Carta.

90
00:09:44,42 --> 00:09:52,43
That was unveiled in Canberra in two thousand and one. One of the panels on the monument says this.

91
00:09:53,97 --> 00:09:59,88
The early colonial settlements founded mostly by convict labor. Imposed this.

92
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:07,43
System of justice at odds with the rights and liberties expressed in Magna Carta.

93
00:10:07,45 --> 00:10:13,38
This for a society where convicts could own property where they could defend it at law

94
00:10:14,54 --> 00:10:22,36
and way they could not be punished further except by a rule of court by an order of a court.

95
00:10:22,38 --> 00:10:27,73
The government was civil not military there was a time in the planning

96
00:10:27,73 --> 00:10:33,76
when it was conceived as a military settlement with military law

97
00:10:35,02 --> 00:10:38,68
but in the further development of the plan for New South Wales.

98
00:10:39,59 --> 00:10:46,77
They moved the British government moved to a civil government for the colony the historians who have taken us through

99
00:10:46,77 --> 00:10:57,36
that process and who have given us a new view of the colony at Botany by Alan frost and that concern. Andrew Tink.

100
00:10:57,38 --> 00:11:06,37
From lighted to die. You of all labored inviting those words on the monument Cambra still stand.

101
00:11:07,27 --> 00:11:21,82
And it would be a good thing if this anniversary led them to rethink and to remove them..

102
00:11:16,48 --> 00:11:21,82
Geoffrey Blainey who first made his mark on the academic scene in the nine hundred sixty S.

103
00:11:22,3 --> 00:11:31,29
Was an economic historian but by no means a Marxist he was not interested in the play of economic interests for years.

104
00:11:31,4 --> 00:11:40,23
Strangely uninterested in politics and the state his interest is in the creation and effects of economic processes.

105
00:11:41,34 --> 00:11:43,37
He is particularly interested in Vientiane

106
00:11:43,37 --> 00:11:51,32
and technology in his first big book the rush that never ended published in nineteen sixty three he offered a new

107
00:11:51,32 --> 00:11:58,18
interpretation of a style his other a billion that of the diggers at Ballarat in fifty four.

108
00:12:01,04 --> 00:12:07,92
Blaney says that by eight hundred fifty four mining at Ballarat meant deep sinking not shallow holes

109
00:12:07,92 --> 00:12:10,76
but shops of over one hundred feet deep

110
00:12:11,46 --> 00:12:20,57
or as Blaney says with his homely hopeful comparisons as deep as in one thousand storey lift Well those shops took over

111
00:12:20,57 --> 00:12:23,53
five months sometimes nine months to dig.

112
00:12:23,96 --> 00:12:33,52
And still gold might not be found this deep sinking he believed was the key to understanding the armed rebellion of the

113
00:12:33,52 --> 00:12:40,7
diggers at Ballarat in one hundred fifty four. Everywhere the collecting of license fees was an annoyance.

114
00:12:41,24 --> 00:12:47,95
But it was infuriating on the deeply men had to come up from the depths to show their licenses

115
00:12:48,76 --> 00:12:56,62
and licenses had to be paid for longer. Before it could be term and determined that the digging was worthwhile.

116
00:12:58,32 --> 00:12:59,66
It was an attractive thesis

117
00:13:00,7 --> 00:13:08,58
and it seemed to bring more depth to the account of the rebellion fifteen years later Western by published his history

118
00:13:08,58 --> 00:13:15,95
of Ballarat which is called Lucky city his chapter on Eureka which I think is still the best thing on that subject

119
00:13:16,85 --> 00:13:24,14
begins with the refutation of Blighty deep sinking since it began at Ballarat in one thousand fifty two had been

120
00:13:24,14 --> 00:13:28,07
associated with peace and not with strife.

121
00:13:28,08 --> 00:13:34,06
The largest protest against the license fee was at Bendigo in one hundred fifty three with the sinking.

122
00:13:34,2 --> 00:13:44,02
We shall Ballarat stayed quiet while the Bendigo protest forced the government into a reduction in the amount of the

123
00:13:44,02 --> 00:13:54,13
license fee bites account of Eureka invokes the traditional stories of license hunts the corruption of officials the

124
00:13:54,13 --> 00:14:00,26
arrogance of the goldfield commissioners and the particular episodes that inflamed feelings about. Right.

125
00:14:00,46 --> 00:14:09,14
Allowing Bentley the hotel proprietor to escape punishment for the murder of a minor called Skokie the harassing by the

126
00:14:09,14 --> 00:14:13,26
police of the servant to the Catholic priest.

127
00:14:13,28 --> 00:14:21,57
But this account is extended by highlighting how an English the administration of the goldfields was the heavy handed

128
00:14:21,57 --> 00:14:27,27
collection of tax the magistrates not being independent gentleman J P's.

129
00:14:28,44 --> 00:14:36,44
But the official commission is themselves who were hearing cases on their own licensing system.

130
00:14:36,46 --> 00:14:43,84
By the way the licensing system which gave such a faints in Victoria began here in New South Wales

131
00:14:43,84 --> 00:14:50,05
but here the fields were smaller and the commissioners more attuned to colonial ways

132
00:14:51,13 --> 00:14:55,59
and not as in Victoria heiress to crack. Puppies. Fresh off the boat.

133
00:14:58,04 --> 00:15:04,41
Bites account draws on and gives new credibility to the contemporary reports by the travellers William Howard

134
00:15:04,41 --> 00:15:12,49
and William Calley who publish books on their experiences in a study in the icing fifty's with how what we hear the

135
00:15:12,49 --> 00:15:20,13
diggers voices here is their response to the police dragging off a respectable storekeeper because they suspected his

136
00:15:20,13 --> 00:15:30,06
horse was stone is this a Christian country. Asked one tick. Is this an English colony asked another no set of food.

137
00:15:30,2 --> 00:15:30,96
It's Russia.

138
00:15:32,75 --> 00:15:37,31
That's the comparison that how it drew himself not an English government

139
00:15:38,1 --> 00:15:49,26
but a Russian despotism which a high spirited free born people could not accept the diggers protest sometimes broaden

140
00:15:49,26 --> 00:15:52,59
into demands for the vote or for access to the land.

141
00:15:52,99 --> 00:15:59,91
But what fueled the whole movement was the feeling that the goldfields administration in Thailand a denial of truth.

142
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:00,71
In all rights

143
00:16:00,71 --> 00:16:07,59
and liberties during the Bendigo protest in one thousand nine hundred fifty three the tense of the diggers refusing to

144
00:16:07,59 --> 00:16:17,42
pay the license carried the plaque I had no chimes for free Englishman a reference to the police China up offenders

145
00:16:17,42 --> 00:16:20,51
and to look Court made.

146
00:16:20,53 --> 00:16:27,43
Shades of the British government in the late eighteenth century deciding that they could not work convicts on China on

147
00:16:27,43 --> 00:16:30,95
the roads because the public would not stand for.

148
00:16:32,28 --> 00:16:40,65
So they had to go on looking for alternative places overseas which to send the condoms the accounts of the goldfields

149
00:16:40,65 --> 00:16:41,25
by William Howard

150
00:16:41,25 --> 00:16:48,93
and William Kelly were drawn on by Henry Handel Richardson for the opening section of her novel The fortunes of Richard

151
00:16:48,93 --> 00:16:57,81
Manning like Howard himself Manny the well educated fastidious doctor is disgusted at Germans

152
00:16:57,81 --> 00:17:02,47
and Americans thrusting themselves forward to lead the diggers protests

153
00:17:02,47 --> 00:17:07,04
and wanting to give them an empty English Republican direction.

154
00:17:08,34 --> 00:17:14,49
Manny takes the platform at a protest meeting but files to evoke enthusiasm for Britain's flag

155
00:17:14,49 --> 00:17:20,96
and its generosity to foreigners. He's a gentleman. Telling the diggers what they should think.

156
00:17:22,11 --> 00:17:28,39
But then his young friend. Purdie takes to the platform still with the mud clinging to his clothes.

157
00:17:29,61 --> 00:17:34,19
Mommy now realizes why he didn't wash and challenge before coming to the meeting.

158
00:17:35,15 --> 00:17:44,22
This is pretty speech which is an elaboration of one William Calley records in outline Richardson follows Kelly exactly

159
00:17:44,22 --> 00:17:53,88
in the opening words brother diggers brother diggers. We are not made here to throw mud at our dear old country's flag.

160
00:17:54,48 --> 00:17:59,62
Nor we have a word said against her most gracious majesty the queen not us.

161
00:18:01,00 --> 00:18:08,06
We have we had men first and diggers afterwards we would not have a word said against her.

162
00:18:08,19 --> 00:18:10,38
Against this gallant little woman.

163
00:18:11,74 --> 00:18:17,9
Are you with me boys very well and now we didn't come here tonight to contact about getting votes

164
00:18:17,9 --> 00:18:23,91
or having a hand in public affairs much as we want them both and mean to have them when the time comes.

165
00:18:24,24 --> 00:18:27,01
No Tonight there's only one thing that matters to us

166
00:18:27,01 --> 00:18:36,14
and that's the repeal of the a curse at Tex He has such an attempt at such a tempest of applause broke out that he was

167
00:18:36,14 --> 00:18:40,61
unable to proceed. Yes I say it again. He went on when they would let him speak.

168
00:18:40,82 --> 00:18:42,38
The instant repeal

169
00:18:42,38 --> 00:18:49,9
when that's been done this cursed taken office then it will be time enough to parley voo about the color of the flag we

170
00:18:49,9 --> 00:18:55,54
mean to have and about going shares in the government. But let me make one thing clear to you.

171
00:18:55,7 --> 00:18:59,16
We're neither traitors to the Crown nor common rebels.

172
00:18:59,5 --> 00:19:08,45
We're true blue Britons who have been goaded to rebellion by one of the violence pieces of tyranny that ever saw the

173
00:19:08,45 --> 00:19:10,33
light.

174
00:19:10,35 --> 00:19:18,95
Fighting against tyranny is part of our usual story about the God proved true blue Britons fighting against tyranny.

175
00:19:20,23 --> 00:19:29,07
That's the element that's often forgotten. There is a strained attempt in popular history in schools and on T.V.

176
00:19:29,07 --> 00:19:33,52
To link the diggers protest at Eureka to the coming of democracy

177
00:19:34,82 --> 00:19:42,4
but no sustained democratic movement emerged from the diggings Victoria would have adopted manhood suffrage without you.

178
00:19:42,41 --> 00:19:51,73
Rica just a South aside a New South Wales did Western by helps us to understand the lack of a sustained democratic

179
00:19:51,73 --> 00:19:59,81
movement. Once the license and the gold through commissioners were swept away the basic loyalty and were.

180
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,97
Centeredness of the goldfields community reasserted itself. It was British again.

181
00:20:07,95 --> 00:20:14,64
Ballarat did not become a hotbed of radicalism for tourism purposes now it might fly the rebel flag

182
00:20:15,42 --> 00:20:18,53
but in the nineteenth century it was the most loyal of cities

183
00:20:19,58 --> 00:20:26,22
when it finally arrested a memorial to the diggers who died at Eureka eating included the nym's of the dead soldiers as

184
00:20:26,22 --> 00:20:34,01
well in the last couple of decades the historical profession has not been much interested in the gold fields

185
00:20:34,01 --> 00:20:41,86
and democracy. It is the gold fields and racism that has come to center stage the N.T.

186
00:20:41,86 --> 00:20:50,17
Chinese movement that began on the goldfields forms part of a study as sorry record as a rice nation which culminated

187
00:20:50,17 --> 00:21:02,02
in the adoption of a Rice's national identity white astride racism is an evil but it is not a fixed and certain entity.

188
00:21:03,04 --> 00:21:07,31
This is commonly not recognize commonly you are racist or you are not.

189
00:21:08,51 --> 00:21:12,86
And once you are uncovered as a racist then your racism is as virulent

190
00:21:12,86 --> 00:21:20,81
and we could as everyone else is the historian of rice ism cannot proceed in this way rises and grows

191
00:21:20,81 --> 00:21:26,29
and declines that it might not disappear its strength faeries it take different.

192
00:21:26,51 --> 00:21:29,98
It takes different forms and targets different objects.

193
00:21:30,9 --> 00:21:35,62
It is subject to a variety of constraints personal and institution.

194
00:21:37,52 --> 00:21:40,73
There are commentators who declare a Strider is still or ISIS nation.

195
00:21:40,93 --> 00:21:46,08
There are undoubtedly still some racists and some racism here.

196
00:21:46,1 --> 00:21:50,43
But a strike in racism cannot now be as strong as it was in ninety nine one

197
00:21:51,24 --> 00:21:55,54
when immigration was totally prohibited astride

198
00:21:55,55 --> 00:21:59,82
and racism cannot now be as strong as Germany's where into recently you.

199
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:02,45
To possess German blood to become a citizen

200
00:22:03,36 --> 00:22:12,97
or strong as Japan's where its no immigration principle is only now being questioned comparisons are hopeful in taking

201
00:22:12,97 --> 00:22:20,61
the measure of racism in nineteen seventy nine when the uncovering of racism in a strike this past.

202
00:22:20,74 --> 00:22:28,01
Was just beginning and remarked has published a book comparing the treatment of the Chinese in California

203
00:22:28,01 --> 00:22:29,59
and the struggle in the nineteenth century.

204
00:22:31,63 --> 00:22:39,75
Marcus reports American dull gold diggers were accustomed to a racial hierarchy before they arrived in California they

205
00:22:39,75 --> 00:22:44,6
knew whites were superior to negroes. So from the jump.

206
00:22:44,66 --> 00:22:54,4
They treated the non white Chinese as inferior as to in Australia at first there was little hostility to the Chinese.

207
00:22:54,42 --> 00:23:00,2
They were regarded as a civilised people. And there was a deal of curiosity about their customs.

208
00:23:02,39 --> 00:23:05,68
But hadn't racism already got a firm hold in the Strider.

209
00:23:05,92 --> 00:23:12,32
Because of the destruction of the Aborigines Marcus found that no one thought of Aborigines

210
00:23:12,32 --> 00:23:18,18
and Chinese together as belonging to inferior races by nine hundred

211
00:23:19,15 --> 00:23:22,79
when racism had got much stronger that link was mine

212
00:23:23,58 --> 00:23:30,97
but not in the aging fifty's the hostility to the Chinese grew in the particular circumstances of the goldfields.

213
00:23:31,42 --> 00:23:33,71
With the Chinese keeping themselves apart

214
00:23:34,78 --> 00:23:44,93
and gold becoming harder to get in a struggle as distinct from California the rule of law extended to the Chinese they

215
00:23:44,94 --> 00:23:51,86
were allowed to give evidence in court taking the oath in their own way in magistrates courts.

216
00:23:52,01 --> 00:23:59,2
They were treated fairly in jury trials not so I worked on occasions not very often.

217
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:09,28
The European diggers drove the Chinese off the gold fields colonial officials in these cases worked to reinstate them

218
00:24:10,62 --> 00:24:13,01
here the goldfield Commission has played

219
00:24:13,01 --> 00:24:18,99
and heroic packed a temper Rouer the commissioner confronted an anti Chinese mob

220
00:24:18,99 --> 00:24:24,71
and declared I would stand to be shot before I allow a Chinaman to be touched.

221
00:24:27,5 --> 00:24:34,29
As a result of the digger's hostility the Chinese to the Chinese colonial government severely restricted the flow of

222
00:24:34,29 --> 00:24:35,41
Chinese immigrants.

223
00:24:36,93 --> 00:24:45,11
Once the borders were secure concerted moves against the Chinese on the Gulf fields ceased they lived on

224
00:24:45,81 --> 00:24:47,2
and in the climbing numbers.

225
00:24:48,23 --> 00:24:52,44
Most of them were going back to China at Bendigo they held

226
00:24:52,44 --> 00:24:58,09
and on a place for they put on a parade with dragons every step as they still do.

227
00:25:00,01 --> 00:25:08,37
Bendigo Ians neverless came with everyone else to believe in the water started a possum in a recent Ph D. Thesis.

228
00:25:08,86 --> 00:25:13,78
Amanda rest mass and puzzles over the relationship between local

229
00:25:13,78 --> 00:25:21,67
and national attitudes to the Chinese in Bendigo she tells of a certain councillor Caroline

230
00:25:21,67 --> 00:25:25,34
and a striking born progressive reformer on the council.

231
00:25:25,76 --> 00:25:27,19
Who wanted to clean up

232
00:25:27,19 --> 00:25:36,83
and dignified Bendigo he called for the houses in the Chinese camps to be destroyed one group of these was not tucked

233
00:25:36,83 --> 00:25:44,8
away. But at the end of the mine street. It looked like on occasions he might get is why.

234
00:25:45,43 --> 00:25:52,33
But he never did the council stall. It asked for reports from police and health officials.

235
00:25:52,35 --> 00:25:59,89
They found some unhealthy buildings but not too much worse than some low class European buildings. The smell.

236
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:07,96
Well so much complained of at the town camp came not from the Chinese the council itself turned out was responsible.

237
00:26:08,25 --> 00:26:21,11
Behind the Chinese came it had located its horsemen you were Depor destroying houses is a serious step one of Carolyn's

238
00:26:21,11 --> 00:26:28,55
opponents on the council to claim that the king himself had no power to interfere with the freehold

239
00:26:28,55 --> 00:26:35,65
or resident titles hill by the Chinese side I remarked on this matter

240
00:26:35,65 --> 00:26:38,98
and in other aspects of Bendigo his life rest mass

241
00:26:38,98 --> 00:26:47,34
and finds that Europeans thought that the Chinese should have failed ply they were more likely to believe that because

242
00:26:47,34 --> 00:26:55,65
not all the Chinese lived in the camps some lived among the rest of the population in similar houses

243
00:26:56,79 --> 00:26:59,35
and were in regular work and our own businesses.

244
00:27:01,96 --> 00:27:09,89
Fair play is an English term that comes from sport the English believe that sport was a preparation for life

245
00:27:10,89 --> 00:27:19,64
and attitudes formed there should be applied to life generally English sport kind to ascribe it and with it.

246
00:27:19,79 --> 00:27:31,29
The notion of fair play fair play is the origin of the a strident farrago even one of evidence speeches against the

247
00:27:31,29 --> 00:27:43,33
Communist Party dissolution bill. He used fair ply fair go. And the principles of British justice interchangeably.

248
00:27:43,35 --> 00:27:49,9
I've been demonstrating the strength of the appeal to British rights and liberties in a struggle.

249
00:27:49,92 --> 00:27:54,5
And now I am pointing to a British origin of the a style unfair God.

250
00:27:56,12 --> 00:27:59,17
This goes against the national nationalist tendency.

251
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:10,16
To see a style in society moving away from Britain and becoming more and more distinctive. Much better.

252
00:28:10,18 --> 00:28:14,77
To see Britishness embedded within a stride.

253
00:28:14,79 --> 00:28:23,19
Much better to think of British culture being re-interpreted in a struggle which is west and by its formulation

254
00:28:24,29 --> 00:28:33,31
or better to read David Maloof wonderful essay on a style entire to. My in England but this is a message.

255
00:28:33,38 --> 00:28:41,12
I don't have to underline to people prepared together in Sydney to celebrate the anniversary of the Magna Carta.

256
00:28:41,42 --> 00:28:50,12
Thank you. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

257
00:28:52,33 --> 00:28:57,95
We don't have time for a few questions and John unfortunately is not going to be part of the panel was soft

258
00:28:57,95 --> 00:29:03,55
and he has to return to Melbourne so this is your opportunity to put any particular questions to him

259
00:29:03,55 --> 00:29:10,68
and I would ask that you keep the questions as brief of rate as possible so are there any questions or brief comments.

260
00:29:11,67 --> 00:29:29,87
Yes the front. Join me on the platform. OK. There was.

261
00:29:29,89 --> 00:29:35,53
Three years corpus cases in New South Wales about preventing Chinese people getting off their ships.

262
00:29:36,08 --> 00:29:42,52
In the third case the Chief Justice in New South Wales and so annoyed by all of us because it was a legal.

263
00:29:42,99 --> 00:29:50,28
He said that a man might even was sort of violent force to protect his liberty. So.

264
00:29:51,77 --> 00:29:56,76
This underlies John's point of course that the more protective the Chinese even though it sometimes also of course

265
00:29:56,76 --> 00:30:01,05
discriminated against. And this discriminate. It wasn't universal.

266
00:30:01,51 --> 00:30:09,24
While the problem set sail for strategy which is where I live had to deal with was the pressure from Victorians to

267
00:30:09,24 --> 00:30:11,55
impose restrictions on Chinese arrivals

268
00:30:12,26 --> 00:30:18,54
and of course the long wonderful story quickly has been Chinese realise if they got off a boat from Victoria they had

269
00:30:18,54 --> 00:30:25,18
to pay a tax. But they look at the map of Savile Strider said if we go to write and walk across the border.

270
00:30:25,21 --> 00:30:33,95
We don't pay the tax. That was also a form of complying with the law. Thank you.

271
00:30:33,97 --> 00:30:42,37
Years later on when some of the restrictions allowed Chinese who were British citizens. Still to come to a strike here.

272
00:30:43,86 --> 00:30:51,83
The number of Chinese who claimed they came from Hong Kong. Went through the roof.

273
00:30:51,85 --> 00:30:59,38
I think citing Japan as being moving away from Ras ism has a certain cultural Hakan many to.

274
00:31:00,82 --> 00:31:10,92
In the sense that we practice very much a global concept of of the free flow of individuals the free flow of cultures.

275
00:31:10,94 --> 00:31:18,59
I think Britain has been the recipient for a long period of Italian culture of Italian personnel of the movement

276
00:31:18,59 --> 00:31:28,39
between continent and Island. To cite Japan as an example of a country moving away from prejudice and.

277
00:31:29,43 --> 00:31:37,62
I think is incorrect. Categorically I think that Japan was isolated for a very long period in terms of moving people.

278
00:31:39,94 --> 00:31:47,01
From Continental Shelf. Even though it had profound influences in terms of the history like Narron and period.

279
00:31:48,7 --> 00:31:54,17
Their ideas are very much based on keeping cultural integrity.

280
00:31:54,73 --> 00:31:59,9
And because of a profound love of the culture and a fear of it being eroded. I'd.

281
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:06,00
I don't regard this as complying with movements for global eyes ation

282
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:11,89
but I don't think a movement as such as you cited. Precious.

283
00:32:12,23 --> 00:32:19,72
I think that if we go against the global movement it doesn't mean we're prejudiced I think that judgment.

284
00:32:19,74 --> 00:32:24,46
Yet I have some sympathy for that viewpoint I think.

285
00:32:24,48 --> 00:32:32,84
Racism is brought out now as a label for all sorts of things which strictly on rice isn't

286
00:32:33,63 --> 00:32:40,32
and what you're suggesting is that. The word that's gone out of all the term that's gone out of use.

287
00:32:40,41 --> 00:32:46,08
Now ethnocentrism might be a more accurate description.

288
00:32:47,56 --> 00:32:57,51
But given the tendency to rises in which I think is you know almost universal. It's no centrism can move very easily.

289
00:32:58,98 --> 00:33:07,13
Into Rice's And I'm not an expert on Japan. You seem to be so I'm out of unfairly libeled.

290
00:33:07,75 --> 00:33:15,39
The Japanese It's interesting that the reason why there. There's some movement.

291
00:33:15,4 --> 00:33:21,65
To reduce the hostility to immigration is because their population is declining.

292
00:33:23,23 --> 00:33:31,36
I think astride a has a wonderful record in transforming itself from I want to strike the country to one of the most

293
00:33:31,36 --> 00:33:35,97
open in the world. I mean the other reason for not thinking of a strike.

294
00:33:36,07 --> 00:33:43,36
So as highly Reisa stories in a phobic is that of all nations on earth we have the highest proportion of people born

295
00:33:43,36 --> 00:33:51,19
outside our country which promise I see seems to indicate that xenophobia and racism.

296
00:33:51,21 --> 00:33:57,89
Can't be very strong but how do we make this transition. And the reason is you know because a start.

297
00:33:57,91 --> 00:33:59,15
Is what particularly virtuous.

298
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:11,24
Well particularly racist the fright that the Japanese gave us in World War two was the argument that cole world used to

299
00:34:11,24 --> 00:34:20,27
persuade astride ins that not that I would accept not what's But they would accept people who weren't British into a

300
00:34:20,27 --> 00:34:27,62
struggle. So sometimes people. This was my point about things that constrain rices and.

301
00:34:28,28 --> 00:34:32,78
You might have Rice's prejudice but they might be other reasons.

302
00:34:33,66 --> 00:34:42,53
Like an aside this case of self defense which leads you to swallow down your prejudices a bit. And.

303
00:34:42,54 --> 00:34:48,53
Be more open in the people you're willing to accept. Thank you. One more question.

304
00:34:51,33 --> 00:34:59,13
And thank you very much for the talks this morning on this question period. As you indicated the principles.

305
00:35:00,59 --> 00:35:04,28
Brought to us tires part of the English or British law.

306
00:35:04,83 --> 00:35:12,07
However was the possibility that some of the principles that made account might be reflected in this community as an

307
00:35:12,07 --> 00:35:14,08
astronomer prior to European settlement.

308
00:35:14,49 --> 00:35:23,39
And if so much does principles be thought of as more universal as Mr Khouri suggested a basic human right.

309
00:35:23,4 --> 00:35:34,64
I'm not an expert on that my first response would be to say no I don't think so because Aboriginal society in.

310
00:35:35,61 --> 00:35:42,86
All aspects is closely involved in kin and obligation to kin.

311
00:35:43,13 --> 00:35:48,95
So the notion of a universe Salah to that we are all citizens

312
00:35:48,95 --> 00:35:58,21
or we are all subjects of the keen this is not going to such notions aren't going to operate in a hunter gatherer

313
00:35:59,48 --> 00:36:07,83
society. Where your obligations are always specifically defined as being to particular persons.

314
00:36:08,13 --> 00:36:14,65
So I don't think these general concepts of rights. Could emerge in Aboriginal society.
