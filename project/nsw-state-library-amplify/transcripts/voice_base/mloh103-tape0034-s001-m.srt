1
00:00:10,11 --> 00:00:18,59
I thought you know fast me.

2
00:00:18,61 --> 00:00:25,41
You know. I was a gig.

3
00:00:25,42 --> 00:00:29,02
You know. Do you.

4
00:00:30,69 --> 00:00:32,71
And judge joan oliver

00:00:34,73 --> 00:00:40,36
and i charge.

6
00:00:41,43 --> 00:00:45,96
I have one cell of a gate
and i fit into the scene.

7
00:00:45,98 --> 00:00:49,16
I was born a year

8
00:00:49,16 --> 00:00:52,79
or so about a year after my parents genova

9
00:00:52,79 --> 00:00:57,71
and john gave me up to nimbin from sydney.

10
00:00:57,73 --> 00:00:59,10
I was their first child

11
00:01:00,06 --> 00:01:05,88
and i lived on paradise valley
which is coming just at an in

12
00:01:07,22 --> 00:01:10,19
until i was about full time
until i was about eight.

13
00:01:10,30 --> 00:01:13,96
I think and my dad me into lismore

14
00:01:14,89 --> 00:01:21,81
and i decided to live with him and visit
mum or have you want to put. Peas.

15
00:01:22,26 --> 00:01:24,21
Gave it a shot as i.

16
00:01:24,90 --> 00:01:27,71
On weekends and that's about it

17
00:01:27,71 --> 00:01:34,49
and turn it like i feel basically i
was one of the first home births in

18
00:01:34,49 --> 00:01:38,80
then when i was a few years later
on two years after my sister.

19
00:01:39,75 --> 00:01:46,71
I was no number 7 baby born
on the community. First. Yes.

20
00:01:46,81 --> 00:01:52,54
First baby home birth on the community
basically lived there till i was about eight.

21
00:01:54,19 --> 00:01:59,65
We our whole my mother. Knew
father that stage move down.

22
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,34
Here tomorrow by just nearby

23
00:02:03,23 --> 00:02:10,51
and i have i basically was full time
at peavey till about the age of eight.

24
00:02:12,16 --> 00:02:15,37
Early hours memories of nimbin.

25
00:02:15,39 --> 00:02:21,99
Would have on the community with
a wide range of friends just as

26
00:02:21,99 --> 00:02:24,46
my memory is this is a
one big happy family.

27
00:02:24,99 --> 00:02:29,80
Basically there was no major
mother figure major father figure.

28
00:02:29,90 --> 00:02:33,60
Everyone could turn to anyone
for any help anything.

29
00:02:33,77 --> 00:02:35,30
You know was a big happy family.

30
00:02:38,40 --> 00:02:39,71
Well i have a lot of memories

31
00:02:39,71 --> 00:02:43,40
and i actually i've been thinking about
it because lots of people say oh my first

32
00:02:43,40 --> 00:02:46,13
memory is of my mum doing
this also and i that.

33
00:02:46,15 --> 00:02:51,32
I don't really know exactly what order
all my memories fit in. I know that.

34
00:02:52,57 --> 00:02:53,90
Tonka toys.

35
00:02:54,99 --> 00:02:58,91
I don't actually let's really talk about
these big family thing i don't really

36
00:02:58,91 --> 00:03:01,96
remember a lot of the parents
my parents are always there.

37
00:03:02,06 --> 00:03:04,92
Whenever you need them but they
weren't a big part of my life.

38
00:03:05,04 --> 00:03:08,80
I mean they probably were that honest
that members i mean basically i member.

39
00:03:09,46 --> 00:03:14,39
Always this group of friends like there was
jamie entirely in all these people who

40
00:03:14,39 --> 00:03:16,10
are older than me and then
there was a group of friends

41
00:03:16,10 --> 00:03:17,99
or my then there was those
who are younger than us.

42
00:03:19,04 --> 00:03:20,73
Members if one particular place.

43
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:24,67
Were used up all the older the
older guys had tonka toys

44
00:03:24,67 --> 00:03:26,44
and we'd make tonka toys cities

45
00:03:26,44 --> 00:03:32,64
and remember mud really just i mean just
having so much fun in the outdoors like i

46
00:03:32,64 --> 00:03:35,68
you know if i ever had a lot
of toys but i just know that.

47
00:03:37,29 --> 00:03:41,77
I didn't have to have something material
in my hands i mean you could go outside

48
00:03:41,77 --> 00:03:45,31
and we'd make mud pies
and bring them into mum

49
00:03:45,31 --> 00:03:47,98
and she'd go big thing then cook them
in the oven and then we'd get side

50
00:03:47,98 --> 00:03:48,24
and eat them.

51
00:03:48,35 --> 00:03:53,88
So i'd have to say the earliest memories
are just of having a whole lot of fun just

52
00:03:53,88 --> 00:03:59,96
with this group of friends like
children and. I mean there were adult.

53
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,48
Influences but basically just the kids
having so much fun would have to the.

54
00:04:05,99 --> 00:04:11,85
Yeah. Bush experience.

55
00:04:13,87 --> 00:04:20,60
A lot of exploring. Was a two i
think two hundred ten acre farm.

56
00:04:21,98 --> 00:04:27,63
Anyway. Quite a large farm for small
kids to explore and so you know there's.

57
00:04:28,23 --> 00:04:32,68
There's a great waterfall there with a
big swimming hole which basically the

58
00:04:32,68 --> 00:04:34,51
community lived around in the summer.

59
00:04:35,34 --> 00:04:40,98
You know just swim every day and there was
some without lots of kids our age old

60
00:04:40,98 --> 00:04:45,72
and young as sally mentions these to be a
lot of trek stuff into the bush just by

61
00:04:45,72 --> 00:04:48,20
ourselves. You know like
that we had the freedom to

62
00:04:48,20 --> 00:04:50,59
that didn't have to be supervised

63
00:04:50,59 --> 00:04:54,73
or you know we didn't have supervision
else just people join in might have been

64
00:04:54,73 --> 00:04:57,54
older but you know we'd
head off into the bush and.

65
00:04:58,13 --> 00:05:02,20
Those are lots of experience
with the bush and nature.

66
00:05:02,56 --> 00:05:04,66
You know a lot of animals on the farm.

67
00:05:06,07 --> 00:05:09,92
A lot of fun with that.

68
00:05:09,94 --> 00:05:14,65
Now i've lived in so called suburbia i
guess is what most people want to hear

69
00:05:14,65 --> 00:05:19,83
when i say the bush experiences
things like yes we.

70
00:05:19,85 --> 00:05:25,22
At one stage we did have i mean we always
had sam i've never except for living with

71
00:05:25,22 --> 00:05:30,96
dad every house. Mum been in is sam
i've built houses sort of things but.

72
00:05:30,97 --> 00:05:34,92
Because i know this is to
another because like my parents

73
00:05:34,92 --> 00:05:38,56
and the people who set up the community
came straight from the city.

74
00:05:38,58 --> 00:05:41,79
I always remember there was always a
bathroom and there was always a kitchen.

75
00:05:41,83 --> 00:05:44,11
I mean. So it wasn't like we are.

76
00:05:44,16 --> 00:05:48,83
I mean we still had to use a gas lamps
every you know but that the main.

77
00:05:49,23 --> 00:05:53,18
The bottom house which was what was the
first regional buildings always had

78
00:05:53,18 --> 00:05:53,62
electricity

79
00:05:54,44 --> 00:05:58,81
and always had all the latest mod cons
basically i mean that's the way i saw it

80
00:05:58,81 --> 00:05:59,47
but.

81
00:06:00,20 --> 00:06:05,86
The bush experience for me would have just
been as janice said we were just given

82
00:06:05,86 --> 00:06:08,03
the freedom and the trust i think that's.

83
00:06:08,73 --> 00:06:12,16
I mean i wasn't a conscious
thing then but reflecting back.

84
00:06:12,42 --> 00:06:16,86
I mean you know my friends i know you
know my mum wouldn't let me do this.

85
00:06:16,92 --> 00:06:17,78
My want to let me do that

86
00:06:17,78 --> 00:06:24,46
and i mean yeah the creek was a
major source we just go for a day

87
00:06:24,46 --> 00:06:27,34
explorations up the creek and we.

88
00:06:28,12 --> 00:06:33,16
I know i wouldn't exactly said i would know
how to build my own house although i'm

89
00:06:33,16 --> 00:06:36,01
sure my mum would disagree here that.

90
00:06:36,09 --> 00:06:42,35
Oh you know a self-sufficient you know
because i think as kids we we were really

91
00:06:42,35 --> 00:06:48,04
not asked to do a lot. I mean.
You know we didn't have tools.

92
00:06:48,45 --> 00:06:52,26
So as such we were just given
the freedom to explore

93
00:06:52,26 --> 00:06:58,33
and i mean i think the so-called
bush experiences has just given me.

94
00:06:59,22 --> 00:07:04,35
I know you just you know i haven't meant
so much technical things of how to set up

95
00:07:04,35 --> 00:07:06,89
this or do this that my city folk think

96
00:07:06,89 --> 00:07:08,99
that that's what the bush
experience is all about.

97
00:07:09,13 --> 00:07:13,87
But it's it's kind of you know a way of
life the way of looking at things sort of

98
00:07:13,87 --> 00:07:17,47
like i think you've got a tall waterfall
and you want to get to the top.

99
00:07:17,56 --> 00:07:21,99
You know how do you do it so i think he's
like i know that answer the question

100
00:07:21,99 --> 00:07:24,24
or not. Really.

101
00:07:30,62 --> 00:07:34,03
I remember. My biological
father and mother.

102
00:07:34,33 --> 00:07:38,07
Through the school basically he
started up the community school

103
00:07:38,07 --> 00:07:40,56
that i went to play a big part in my life.

104
00:07:42,78 --> 00:07:44,45
So i was quite interesting relating them.

105
00:07:44,90 --> 00:07:48,39
Relating to them as parents
as well as my teachers

106
00:07:48,39 --> 00:07:52,27
and it was a very interesting
way to relate to them.

107
00:07:52,44 --> 00:07:55,40
You know wasn't a father
figure. A mother figure.

108
00:07:55,67 --> 00:07:59,92
You know for someone there to had all
this knowledge that we get out of them.

109
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,19
Stuff that in a fun way that.
I remember a lot of a lot of.

110
00:08:07,50 --> 00:08:14,08
Good times laughing times with them
they always seem to be busy happy.

111
00:08:15,15 --> 00:08:21,09
And i always like how ready to share share
the parenting like it wasn't like they

112
00:08:21,09 --> 00:08:26,17
were like mum was like clucky hanover is
you know she's happy to lotus off find

113
00:08:26,17 --> 00:08:29,30
other people and because you
know go spend time with us. So.

114
00:08:30,79 --> 00:08:32,21
It was an interesting experience with

115
00:08:37,44 --> 00:08:43,06
communities who well. So
i guess for them. Yeah.

116
00:08:44,88 --> 00:08:47,07
The key really the school. I guess i need.

117
00:08:47,24 --> 00:08:49,80
I don't know how many years i went there.

118
00:08:50,68 --> 00:08:53,64
The main thing that the community
school i remember is kids circus.

119
00:08:54,08 --> 00:09:00,12
And the school was in two
buildings there was.

120
00:09:00,14 --> 00:09:03,78
The community school which has been
old commonwealth bank i think and

121
00:09:03,78 --> 00:09:09,79
that was the main school
and it had. I know i mean.

122
00:09:09,81 --> 00:09:13,76
It wasn't like a school because there
was rooms but there was a kitchen and

123
00:09:14,49 --> 00:09:18,80
and because it was like it was like
a house really more than a bank

124
00:09:18,80 --> 00:09:23,54
and so you know we do cooking as
in-home science but it would be.

125
00:09:24,91 --> 00:09:29,62
I mean that's been in the way everyone
taught in the community school was it wasn't

126
00:09:29,62 --> 00:09:31,65
like you were going to
learn how to make this.

127
00:09:31,74 --> 00:09:35,60
It's oh yeah well if you managed
to make it at the end that's fine

128
00:09:35,60 --> 00:09:38,55
but all the lessons along
the way is more important.

129
00:09:38,56 --> 00:09:41,68
I still had this one memory
of we were making toffee.

130
00:09:41,86 --> 00:09:46,99
I think it was and as
it was one stove and.

131
00:09:47,01 --> 00:09:49,89
10 people making coffee you
know two people person.

132
00:09:49,89 --> 00:09:50,88
What we're staring wagon

133
00:09:50,88 --> 00:09:53,95
and the by the time the last
person had cooked their toffee

134
00:09:53,95 --> 00:09:57,52
and ready to go to the next day
to first person toffee was hard.

135
00:09:57,60 --> 00:09:59,36
So there was our first lesson and.

136
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,40
Then there was the lesson of if we use
a metal spoon we're going to get hot

137
00:10:03,40 --> 00:10:07,68
but if we use a wooden spoon it's going to
burn in a freezer plastic spoon is going

138
00:10:07,68 --> 00:10:11,37
to melt so which option is the best i
mean i have all these crazy memories

139
00:10:12,08 --> 00:10:13,95
but i mean it's just great.

140
00:10:14,25 --> 00:10:18,39
I mean basically i have
lots of just stories

141
00:10:18,39 --> 00:10:20,10
and memories from the community school.

142
00:10:20,62 --> 00:10:23,73
The other part of the community
schools the t s or the tomato sauce

143
00:10:24,88 --> 00:10:27,91
and the to my source i
remember as a kid circa space

144
00:10:27,91 --> 00:10:32,14
and would woodworks face down the like and

145
00:10:33,21 --> 00:10:37,28
and pottery pottery was we had a
little wheel and things like that

146
00:10:37,28 --> 00:10:43,24
and i have to tell you this
story. I was really on and.

147
00:10:43,25 --> 00:10:48,80
We had we were going out to mom had decided
we're going to start doing some digs

148
00:10:48,80 --> 00:10:49,20
or ing

149
00:10:49,20 --> 00:10:54,27
and so she said right we're going to get
the jig saw you thought out this is great.

150
00:10:54,43 --> 00:10:58,30
I want to get to show all my
friends my new camera the frog

151
00:10:58,30 --> 00:11:01,59
and miss piggy did so puzzle that
i had just got the other day.

152
00:11:01,78 --> 00:11:04,19
So we were up you know we had a bus.

153
00:11:04,22 --> 00:11:06,09
I think it was we drove back to peavy

154
00:11:06,09 --> 00:11:12,10
and mum got out he would take would work
jigsaw that cuts would and so i was going.

155
00:11:12,11 --> 00:11:14,54
That doesn't look like
my teeth of hope so.

156
00:11:14,60 --> 00:11:19,57
I mean that's the way you kind of learn
things it was like i mean the reason

157
00:11:19,57 --> 00:11:23,80
that i had great fun
and i mean i remember.

158
00:11:23,82 --> 00:11:25,99
I have to i'm i've got all these guys

159
00:11:25,99 --> 00:11:28,34
and i currently terrible because
they are just a waste of time

160
00:11:28,34 --> 00:11:35,42
but not answering the question what did
you really do school i'm members being.

161
00:11:35,44 --> 00:11:40,47
On them when i first went
to a so-called proper.

162
00:11:40,49 --> 00:11:44,46
I don't know what you want to
call public school really worried

163
00:11:44,46 --> 00:11:50,87
that i wouldn't be up to scratch
but i now realise that.

164
00:11:50,89 --> 00:11:54,40
I say maybe there wasn't you know.

165
00:11:54,42 --> 00:11:59,17
The heaviest emphasis on let's getting
academic work but i learnt so.

166
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,23
So many other things so many
important things about life.

167
00:12:03,42 --> 00:12:07,92
I mean not you know great life stories
i think you know nothing like that

168
00:12:07,92 --> 00:12:13,56
but just so many things that have
changed and made me the way i am that.

169
00:12:14,10 --> 00:12:19,11
You really wouldn't have got
in an ordinary school because.

170
00:12:19,13 --> 00:12:21,67
I mean just and you know
just the way it was taught.

171
00:12:21,70 --> 00:12:23,35
I mean as a start with

172
00:12:23,35 --> 00:12:29,15
and i mean i member this kid circus i mean
i can talk about the kids echoes i have

173
00:12:29,15 --> 00:12:33,14
to say. When the community school
first we had a day a week.

174
00:12:33,36 --> 00:12:39,10
I think it was i'm not quite sure i
was so young. I just remember and.

175
00:12:39,12 --> 00:12:44,61
It was just a major influence on my life
i was a clown later on i got nine baggy

176
00:12:44,61 --> 00:12:49,64
pants but even when i first started i don't
think i had a name i was just a clown.

177
00:12:49,66 --> 00:12:53,52
And i remember we did this you know got
our whole performance together and.

178
00:12:55,21 --> 00:12:56,65
And we toured and it seemed to me

179
00:12:56,65 --> 00:12:59,97
that we may as well have gone
to sydney it turned out now

180
00:12:59,97 --> 00:13:03,87
that we only went to ballina but the
travel and the excitement and things like

181
00:13:03,87 --> 00:13:09,59
that and i think i mean now there's no
way i can get up on stage and do all

182
00:13:09,59 --> 00:13:12,07
that sort of stuff that
i used to like i could

183
00:13:12,07 --> 00:13:16,92
but i'd go home on oscar you know i'll
get all embarrassed with that just.

184
00:13:16,94 --> 00:13:20,33
It was good that it didn't
give you the confidence that.

185
00:13:20,46 --> 00:13:22,77
Oh i'm so wonderful and
all this sort of stuff

186
00:13:22,77 --> 00:13:26,12
but it gave me confidence in
yourself you didn't think

187
00:13:26,12 --> 00:13:30,11
that you are better than anyone else just
because you were on stage you didn't

188
00:13:30,11 --> 00:13:33,20
think that. Oh i don't know.

189
00:13:33,22 --> 00:13:37,06
You know you just thought you
felt really confident in yourself

190
00:13:37,06 --> 00:13:41,57
and you saw this is great and i
just remember having so much fun.

191
00:13:41,75 --> 00:13:45,96
I mean you can really skills
a raid. It was like i mean.

192
00:13:45,98 --> 00:13:51,69
I can i mean i can remember specifically
lessons i can you know one specific lesson

193
00:13:51,69 --> 00:13:54,21
of learning about the parts were frog

194
00:13:54,21 --> 00:13:58,53
and i mean you like i don't remember any
of this sort of stuff from you know public

195
00:13:58,53 --> 00:14:01,93
schools. It's all just i yeah were. Had
to spell out who he went to right.

196
00:14:02,05 --> 00:14:06,31
But just i don't know if it was
because it was that stage of my life

197
00:14:06,31 --> 00:14:10,04
but i remember specific
incidents and things like that

198
00:14:10,04 --> 00:14:13,08
that just really stand out and.

199
00:14:13,10 --> 00:14:15,77
Go and help me get to
my boy economics period

200
00:14:15,77 --> 00:14:21,63
that i mean my friends
still they still go.

201
00:14:21,65 --> 00:14:24,03
Yeah i know you're just joking aren't you.

202
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:28,97
Really in a circus and
i tell my stories and.

203
00:14:28,99 --> 00:14:34,88
Yeah you know community schools just.
As i said taught you a lot of stuff.

204
00:14:35,03 --> 00:14:41,72
Not necessarily strict
academic stuff but. Damn fine.

205
00:14:41,89 --> 00:14:46,54
Yeah i'd go along with that. Just
the style in which they taught it.

206
00:14:47,56 --> 00:14:50,54
I my i have lots of memories
of the community school

207
00:14:50,54 --> 00:14:57,54
but not one is actually learning like
being sat down and saying learn this.

208
00:14:57,59 --> 00:14:58,83
You have to know if a test.

209
00:14:58,84 --> 00:15:00,22
No tests and that nothing like

210
00:15:00,22 --> 00:15:04,00
that basically is the sharing of
knowledge to the younger kids.

211
00:15:04,24 --> 00:15:09,74
I mean i remember going to actual public
school for a short period of time

212
00:15:09,74 --> 00:15:11,11
and being there.

213
00:15:11,11 --> 00:15:15,51
You know no you know there's going to be
like proper academic questions with maths

214
00:15:15,51 --> 00:15:20,58
and thing i sat down in a class of kids
my age not actually think you have i ever

215
00:15:20,58 --> 00:15:23,20
done mass sat down with questions

216
00:15:23,20 --> 00:15:28,58
and i breezed through them i was at the
top of the class by big majority right

217
00:15:28,58 --> 00:15:33,72
when he was always like my teacher so here
i mean i had i had a rat's tail my hair

218
00:15:33,72 --> 00:15:34,85
was shave i was a rat.

219
00:15:34,87 --> 00:15:38,67
You know i didn't have a uniform i was just
you know i just a little hippy kid with

220
00:15:38,67 --> 00:15:41,42
you know kind of shocked everyone

221
00:15:41,42 --> 00:15:46,98
and here i was way ahead of everyone
else in my schooling academia side

222
00:15:46,98 --> 00:15:51,64
and i was a kid i think the community
school was just wonderful. It really was.

223
00:15:51,67 --> 00:15:56,17
I mean sour mention the surface hours
incredible that really was. But.

224
00:15:58,73 --> 00:16:03,62
I mean i think. Biggest thing i still
have is the memory where i was a dog.

225
00:16:03,98 --> 00:16:07,40
And i had to go out and do a
certain saying but i came in early

226
00:16:08,30 --> 00:16:09,87
but of course the people watching.

227
00:16:10,04 --> 00:16:10,56
They didn't know

228
00:16:10,56 --> 00:16:14,07
but to me it was a big thing you
know i'd come in early on my act

229
00:16:14,07 --> 00:16:18,59
and i know what should i do you know
the things that's cause a little kid

230
00:16:18,59 --> 00:16:19,54
that was important to me

231
00:16:19,54 --> 00:16:24,67
but i remember several scenes in like
performing in front of like a scene like

232
00:16:24,67 --> 00:16:26,59
everyone in name would come out to see.

233
00:16:26,89 --> 00:16:30,64
I remember performing in the the
butter factory the big concert.

234
00:16:30,65 --> 00:16:34,97
No hall thing and we did a performance
there and it seemed like everyone.

235
00:16:35,53 --> 00:16:38,76
In my whole world of nimbin was
there watching us on stage

236
00:16:38,76 --> 00:16:43,36
and i was a real buzz that was really good
things like that are incredible. But.

237
00:16:43,74 --> 00:16:46,03
I mean like doing the aboriginal studies.

238
00:16:46,36 --> 00:16:50,41
You know i mean this day in age i mean you
know i need high school just about to go

239
00:16:50,41 --> 00:16:54,78
into year 10. And like you
know you learn about australia

240
00:16:54,79 --> 00:16:58,21
and sure you do aboriginals
they were natives today dada.

241
00:16:58,56 --> 00:17:01,07
But you don't learn a really about them.

242
00:17:01,25 --> 00:17:05,23
We had a man who just
knew so much about them.

243
00:17:05,29 --> 00:17:10,93
We took camping trips up in rivers and
we joe and we basically live like them

244
00:17:10,93 --> 00:17:13,12
and learnt about them and hunt like them

245
00:17:13,12 --> 00:17:17,16
and it was just incredible like
you know here we were only young

246
00:17:17,16 --> 00:17:19,82
but learning just incredible
skills and knowledge

247
00:17:19,82 --> 00:17:23,09
that there's so many people
out there just won't know.

248
00:17:23,59 --> 00:17:26,79
The whole lifetime and here we
were through the community school.

249
00:17:27,38 --> 00:17:31,31
You know learning about such things
as that this incredible really was.

250
00:17:33,23 --> 00:17:39,09
You know that that was just a point. Anna
said was amazing was. We learnt so much.

251
00:17:39,57 --> 00:17:41,87
It was i mean.

252
00:17:41,89 --> 00:17:45,87
Mainly because it wasn't categorized
into this is what you know and this year

253
00:17:45,87 --> 00:17:47,14
and this is what you can only next year.

254
00:17:47,30 --> 00:17:52,95
I have to say that although it was
different. The amount that i've learnt.

255
00:17:53,01 --> 00:17:57,37
Well i can't say it was the time standard
if the sat in an island in the time span

256
00:17:57,37 --> 00:17:59,76
of any man and the same time. Span.

257
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,82
Outside there was just although
i learnt a lot of other things.

258
00:18:04,34 --> 00:18:09,62
It was just as i said all my memories are
from nimbin all my childhood memories.

259
00:18:09,75 --> 00:18:12,22
Every memory that i always go back

260
00:18:12,22 --> 00:18:16,17
and chuckle on is formed before i
left which was when i was eight.

261
00:18:16,24 --> 00:18:20,04
So i have i have to say we
just learnt so much. It was.

262
00:18:21,05 --> 00:18:23,71
I mean basically it just
provided a whole base.

263
00:18:24,09 --> 00:18:28,07
I mean as mum was saying earlier
having all these different influences

264
00:18:28,07 --> 00:18:33,75
and not having the teacher student
relationship not having that so you know

265
00:18:33,75 --> 00:18:35,20
that so-called relationship.

266
00:18:35,80 --> 00:18:39,55
It was good because you wouldn't just say
ah there just one teacher sort of thing

267
00:18:39,55 --> 00:18:39,71
you think.

268
00:18:39,86 --> 00:18:44,39
Well i respect this person so i actually
going to want to learn about what they

269
00:18:44,39 --> 00:18:50,05
have to share and i think having such a
number of adults and a really broad base.

270
00:18:50,07 --> 00:18:56,06
Means that we were able to
really say well i think

271
00:18:56,06 --> 00:18:58,19
that idea is right and i
think that idea is wrong

272
00:18:58,19 --> 00:19:00,78
and just a community school
the whole atmosphere

273
00:19:00,78 --> 00:19:07,34
and environment really let us
learn just. So much really.

274
00:19:07,44 --> 00:19:07,68
S

275
00:19:07,68 --> 00:19:11,73
that i think is really important to base
your character for the rest of your life of

276
00:19:11,73 --> 00:19:13,96
the afghan actual learning of it.

277
00:19:14,76 --> 00:19:20,21
Like i said for wasn't in a teaching way
as such as we're used to in this you know

278
00:19:20,93 --> 00:19:24,69
schooling system as well we
wouldn't sit down in class

279
00:19:24,69 --> 00:19:29,05
and say we're going to learn this as
such and learn it. You have to know it.

280
00:19:29,86 --> 00:19:36,45
It was i can't remember being taught
as such something direct we just

281
00:19:36,45 --> 00:19:38,70
learnt it didn't they do it in practice.

282
00:19:39,09 --> 00:19:42,31
Basically they want to teach us
something we'd go out and do it.

283
00:19:42,31 --> 00:19:45,06
So we'd learn from it so out
of a textbook. You know.

284
00:19:45,67 --> 00:19:48,55
We want to learn about the oceans and
how it worked. Would go to the ocean.

285
00:19:48,83 --> 00:19:50,73
We'd spend a week camping on it

286
00:19:50,73 --> 00:19:53,46
and we'd learn about it much more
than learn reading over textbooks.

287
00:19:53,69 --> 00:19:56,27
You know it's just incredible
the way they taught it to us.

288
00:19:56,31 --> 00:19:59,50
I think was the main thing
that made us learn so much.

289
00:20:04,74 --> 00:20:10,10
This. Oh yeah.

290
00:20:10,19 --> 00:20:12,55
And there was.

291
00:20:12,57 --> 00:20:16,04
Yeah there was the public school
which was just down the road

292
00:20:16,97 --> 00:20:19,23
and so there's a community
school in the public school

293
00:20:20,43 --> 00:20:26,56
but i think the whole of nimbin
really just learnt to integrate

294
00:20:26,57 --> 00:20:27,74
and you know.

295
00:20:27,99 --> 00:20:32,56
One there wasn't wasn't segregation
like you know rednecks

296
00:20:32,56 --> 00:20:35,58
and hillbillies things like an
american nothing like that at all.

297
00:20:35,91 --> 00:20:40,49
Basically that i can recall
you know. I think there.

298
00:20:40,60 --> 00:20:42,54
I have to just to do to gave you.

299
00:20:42,60 --> 00:20:46,01
That's just different memories
and it wasn't there was.

300
00:20:47,13 --> 00:20:50,35
I wouldn't even say separation
that's too strong a word there was.

301
00:20:51,63 --> 00:20:54,42
There's the words a difference
and separation too strong.

302
00:20:54,43 --> 00:20:57,68
There were the people who went
to the name and community school

303
00:20:57,68 --> 00:21:00,72
and there were the people
who went to nimbin sensual

304
00:21:00,72 --> 00:21:05,96
and every line times i used to track up
by their lunch and some job at the state.

305
00:21:06,02 --> 00:21:09,13
We used to have the good old oh yes
and they used their house or us

306
00:21:09,13 --> 00:21:10,03
and we used to hassle them

307
00:21:10,03 --> 00:21:15,59
but going home on the bus together were
all friends so it was like it was there

308
00:21:17,21 --> 00:21:21,73
but i never really think it got to be in
there was you know integrity stick i don't

309
00:21:21,73 --> 00:21:24,94
know if that's right word. I'm not
really big on english but it was just.

310
00:21:26,55 --> 00:21:32,66
It was there because i think we i
don't know if we had it was that

311
00:21:32,66 --> 00:21:35,74
that was our you know
that society these groups

312
00:21:35,74 --> 00:21:41,27
or if we were just having fun because
hey why not because i don't have

313
00:21:41,27 --> 00:21:42,43
that he even nature or not

314
00:21:42,43 --> 00:21:48,58
but it never in my experience never was
anything more than a friendly joke.

315
00:21:48,84 --> 00:21:51,29
I mean i mean it might have
been for the older kids

316
00:21:51,29 --> 00:21:55,29
but i mean as i said going on
the bus that wasn't a problem.

317
00:21:55,58 --> 00:21:59,93
You know there was no two sitting next to
her anything like that because. I think.

318
00:22:00,99 --> 00:22:05,85
I know. It was just there was two
different schools and you know.

319
00:22:06,48 --> 00:22:09,97
We all we all still had you
know we're all still human.

320
00:22:10,14 --> 00:22:12,45
So it wasn't really a problem.
I think that was good.

321
00:22:12,69 --> 00:22:16,94
Having being i don't know that was
because of my age i was still in

322
00:22:16,94 --> 00:22:20,65
that kind of naïve group where
everybody is my friend and

323
00:22:21,53 --> 00:22:25,14
that you know i think
that's just another thing

324
00:22:25,14 --> 00:22:30,06
and as we got out of nimbin it was like
well it doesn't matter you know i mean it

325
00:22:30,06 --> 00:22:30,59
doesn't matter if

326
00:22:30,59 --> 00:22:35,32
that person's driving a you know my side
is in this person's driving a bombed up

327
00:22:35,32 --> 00:22:38,74
cars their friends their friends
or thing and i think that was.

328
00:22:39,32 --> 00:22:40,17
Yeah

329
00:22:40,17 --> 00:22:49,54
that was really you know the
positives really dinner table

330
00:22:50,31 --> 00:22:50,94
one memory.

331
00:22:50,98 --> 00:22:57,01
If you could call the memories of not having
any memory of ever getting in trouble.

332
00:22:58,17 --> 00:23:01,37
Very as friends and i say my first
memory is when my mom hit me

333
00:23:01,37 --> 00:23:05,24
or something like that which
is. And i mean i remember.

334
00:23:05,25 --> 00:23:08,46
Without going into specific detail.

335
00:23:08,48 --> 00:23:09,95
A few myself

336
00:23:09,95 --> 00:23:16,40
and a few friends demolished
a certain space of a person.

337
00:23:17,16 --> 00:23:20,16
I don't know that we even really
had a reason we did to begin with

338
00:23:20,16 --> 00:23:24,56
but then i think we've got carried away
with demolishing this space basically

339
00:23:24,56 --> 00:23:27,16
and all of its contents and member.

340
00:23:27,50 --> 00:23:32,34
As soon as we'd finished were absolutely
horrified at ourselves. I mean.

341
00:23:32,93 --> 00:23:34,53
We we were crying

342
00:23:34,53 --> 00:23:39,37
and shaking just at the thought of because
we know we knew well he had done was

343
00:23:39,37 --> 00:23:41,85
just so wrong it was just so out of line.

344
00:23:41,94 --> 00:23:45,31
He was just i mean basically we knew
we'd been totally irresponsible and

345
00:23:46,19 --> 00:23:47,93
and i guess also because we knew

346
00:23:47,93 --> 00:23:53,18
that we deserved to you
know not have lost trust

347
00:23:53,18 --> 00:23:59,42
but i mean we knew that we'd
broken trust and. And remember.

348
00:24:01,49 --> 00:24:02,93
We we're just absolutely terrified

349
00:24:02,93 --> 00:24:07,13
but we said right we we've got a dog
ourselves in we've done these horrific acts

350
00:24:07,13 --> 00:24:13,46
you know we've got to do this so we went
and i don't even remember an angry voice.

351
00:24:14,05 --> 00:24:18,87
I don't remember a person saying oh.
Tut tut. I mean i really don't.

352
00:24:18,95 --> 00:24:23,45
All i remember was having to stick
newspaper between pages of wet books

353
00:24:23,45 --> 00:24:25,92
that had been left out of night and.

354
00:24:27,35 --> 00:24:28,20
But i don't think

355
00:24:28,20 --> 00:24:34,17
that it was a situation where it
wasn't like we could get away with it

356
00:24:34,17 --> 00:24:35,78
but it wasn't like we got in trouble.

357
00:24:36,03 --> 00:24:42,73
Somehow we we we knew we learnt
from the whole process and learnt

358
00:24:42,73 --> 00:24:45,68
that what we'd done was wrong
and you know went on from

359
00:24:45,68 --> 00:24:51,37
that without having to be yelled at. I
mean basically i i was never yelled at.

360
00:24:51,53 --> 00:24:51,74
I mean.

361
00:24:51,86 --> 00:24:56,07
Oh that's not too well yes it is actually
i don't i mean i don't know if it's this

362
00:24:56,07 --> 00:24:59,58
good of that block out the bad memories
but i mean we all had our disagreements

363
00:24:59,58 --> 00:25:04,87
and i remember john and i used
to fight like tooth and nail.

364
00:25:05,44 --> 00:25:09,88
But. Even even this is classic
memory even when we were fighting.

365
00:25:10,02 --> 00:25:13,91
He still used to call me sal and
i still used to call him bines

366
00:25:13,91 --> 00:25:17,84
but we became so do that and then usually
you know in some get them you know.

367
00:25:18,07 --> 00:25:20,89
So we all come down
here sort of thing and.

368
00:25:22,25 --> 00:25:26,19
Yeah i mean i remember joe
and i used to not get on

369
00:25:26,19 --> 00:25:31,72
but we used to get on sort of being
that now i never really disciplined.

370
00:25:32,13 --> 00:25:35,68
Yet we didn't turn out to be. Raucous.

371
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:41,74
Like rockets very we didn't turn out
to be i don't know rebels to society

372
00:25:41,74 --> 00:25:45,77
or anything like that it was just i
think it was respect to smear surest.

373
00:25:46,17 --> 00:25:52,78
Basically. Sally said like there was
never i mean i remember one case.

374
00:25:52,80 --> 00:25:57,23
There was a very clear there was
a nothing on the side of female

375
00:25:57,24 --> 00:25:59,90
and male didn't matter of thing all out.

376
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:04,08
Friends just a group of kids didn't matter
if they were girls didn't matter boys

377
00:26:04,08 --> 00:26:09,43
you know been naked didn't mean a thing you
know we surround the farm with no close

378
00:26:09,43 --> 00:26:11,90
on around it didn't you
know didn't matter.

379
00:26:11,95 --> 00:26:17,20
But i mean i remember for some reason
this girl lucy came up said hi.

380
00:26:17,22 --> 00:26:22,34
Jonah and i hit her. I mean as a first time
i've ever hit somebody my life i think.

381
00:26:22,77 --> 00:26:28,32
I i stood there i didn't know why he does.
And she is today and you know why he.

382
00:26:28,51 --> 00:26:29,80
I you know i hit her.

383
00:26:31,63 --> 00:26:33,68
At this and she started crying on

384
00:26:33,68 --> 00:26:38,21
and i went to bed which is just
another mother figure to said oh no.

385
00:26:38,31 --> 00:26:42,17
Lucy came in crying said what happened
was i joana hit me for she counted

386
00:26:42,17 --> 00:26:46,48
and everything and then becomes at the
meeting as oh why did you hit a joe

387
00:26:46,48 --> 00:26:48,91
and i said. And i said.

388
00:26:49,24 --> 00:26:54,83
Because she said hello and i think i'll
write a whole sitting here shaking.

389
00:26:55,19 --> 00:26:58,25
No reason to be shaking so i
knew i'd never be hitter any

390
00:26:58,25 --> 00:27:02,54
but still the factor does something wrong.
You know and she goes oh that's right.

391
00:27:02,89 --> 00:27:05,11
They take no shit from
nobody. If they say hello.

392
00:27:06,79 --> 00:27:10,04
So the way of the way in
like disciplining people.

393
00:27:10,30 --> 00:27:13,72
Was it a lighthearted funny
way i mean she could see

394
00:27:13,72 --> 00:27:17,06
that i mean it knows no i'm
going to continue to do it

395
00:27:17,06 --> 00:27:22,27
but i just you know just cases like that.
I think i think it's just incredible.

396
00:27:22,30 --> 00:27:25,59
They were brought up. I mean it's
really benefitted i think me.

397
00:27:26,00 --> 00:27:31,40
I think it's also an hour later life down
high school still way we relate to life

398
00:27:31,40 --> 00:27:36,22
and everything is totally different
because of our childhood upbringing in.

399
00:27:36,24 --> 00:27:39,77
I think also just the
way we were up made us.

400
00:27:40,17 --> 00:27:43,58
I mean just reflecting just
now on what jonah said

401
00:27:43,58 --> 00:27:47,03
and what i think we both knew
that we'd done something wrong

402
00:27:47,73 --> 00:27:52,83
and i mean before we'd even so-called
confessed our fins whatever we knew that

403
00:27:52,83 --> 00:27:57,04
that was just totally out of order and
it was like i think that another.

404
00:27:57,34 --> 00:27:59,94
That we've got out of our. You know it.

405
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:02,19
How we've been up brought up is

406
00:28:02,19 --> 00:28:07,42
that the reason i mean maybe the reason
there wasn't such discipline in discipline

407
00:28:07,42 --> 00:28:09,21
measures was there wasn't a need for it.

408
00:28:09,24 --> 00:28:12,72
I mean i don't know if
that was just i mean

409
00:28:12,72 --> 00:28:16,19
that was the way we brought up we knew
that that was right and that was wrong.

410
00:28:16,28 --> 00:28:20,66
I mean. I mean yeah i mean
we still had disagreements.

411
00:28:21,09 --> 00:28:24,61
I mean i remember there was a big
disagreement as my vegetable eating habits

412
00:28:24,61 --> 00:28:25,18
and stuff like

413
00:28:25,18 --> 00:28:30,23
that this this very table here was
the one we used to cram 20 people on

414
00:28:30,23 --> 00:28:34,49
and i used to hate vegetables so i
used to pass them over out my head

415
00:28:34,49 --> 00:28:41,25
and under the table and he gave a
broccoli i think hit my line in the leg

416
00:28:41,25 --> 00:28:44,92
and she looked and there was
the diet contents of my plate.

417
00:28:45,10 --> 00:28:50,32
And a will and i think that.
I mean that was amazing.

418
00:28:50,73 --> 00:28:56,18
Issue but finally a guy tavy
freeman who's he was old

419
00:28:56,18 --> 00:28:59,49
and he kind of i would consider him a
little brother just said because they were

420
00:28:59,49 --> 00:29:02,58
hassling me that he said just
leave a line to surviving.

421
00:29:02,69 --> 00:29:03,95
I think or something like that

422
00:29:03,95 --> 00:29:08,39
and they did i mean i'm still not they
canned vegetables but i'm not dying

423
00:29:08,39 --> 00:29:13,54
and yeah it was it was there
was another thing that.

424
00:29:13,56 --> 00:29:19,48
The parents the adults had respect for
the kids. It wasn't like yes nice day.

425
00:29:19,50 --> 00:29:22,89
Whatever you say just go
away and play and so i think

426
00:29:22,89 --> 00:29:28,52
that because we were given respect we
could give respect and trust back and so

427
00:29:29,66 --> 00:29:33,78
when we done something wrong we just say
look i've done this wrong and. But it was.

428
00:29:35,09 --> 00:29:39,46
I think i speak out what so you said
earlier about tovey bringing your older

429
00:29:39,46 --> 00:29:43,45
brother. That's one thing which
on the community and in nimbin.

430
00:29:43,83 --> 00:29:48,00
Was a big thing i would like i would
say that it was a huge family.

431
00:29:48,25 --> 00:29:52,05
I mean i see toby and jamie all these guys

432
00:29:52,05 --> 00:29:56,54
and girls on the farm as my older
brothers and sisters and younger brothers

433
00:29:56,54 --> 00:29:59,85
and sisters biologically caylee weren't.

434
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,70
What we were you know we were just as
close as they. You know like we had us.

435
00:30:04,82 --> 00:30:07,12
If not close. If we had
troubles like you know i mean

436
00:30:07,12 --> 00:30:11,58
when i was just a little jamie entirely
they still carry me around drag me around

437
00:30:11,58 --> 00:30:15,32
in a cardboard box and i see they're
tested for their belief cards

438
00:30:15,32 --> 00:30:16,93
and i mean you know.

439
00:30:16,96 --> 00:30:23,29
Just one great big happy family
basically with people parents right

440
00:30:23,29 --> 00:30:25,49
and a heap of brothers and sisters.

441
00:30:26,34 --> 00:30:30,04
It wasn't like they were that family they
were under that surname and we were here.

442
00:30:30,37 --> 00:30:34,50
Basically we're all brothers and sisters.
You know and i was just really good.

443
00:30:34,95 --> 00:30:35,85
As if to say

444
00:30:35,85 --> 00:30:42,03
that now being a teen as a
whole adolescent teenager.

445
00:30:42,05 --> 00:30:44,76
And talking with all my friends
i would just have to say

446
00:30:44,76 --> 00:30:49,83
that my childhood would have to
be probably the happiest. I mean.

447
00:30:50,52 --> 00:30:53,94
Really being if i could not
have wanted it any other way.

448
00:30:54,96 --> 00:30:58,27
It was just i mean i don't know if i'd
want to live there now because i haven't

449
00:30:58,27 --> 00:30:59,66
been there so it's hard to say

450
00:31:00,50 --> 00:31:06,53
but it was just it was just
me going through and living

451
00:31:06,53 --> 00:31:09,81
and i was i think this is pretty normal.
Doesn't everyone live like this.

452
00:31:09,93 --> 00:31:11,78
I mean i didn't really think
that but i just thought i.

453
00:31:11,80 --> 00:31:15,18
Oh this is great and haven't
heaps of fun and fantastic

454
00:31:15,19 --> 00:31:18,80
but looking back you know selecting
and all that sort of stuff.

455
00:31:18,94 --> 00:31:24,89
I just have to say that oh it was
just unbelievable. I can't i.

456
00:31:24,89 --> 00:31:28,73
Still i mean it shocks me myself i
still just sit back and go. Wow.

457
00:31:29,07 --> 00:31:32,82
I have had the best time it was just.

458
00:31:33,79 --> 00:31:34,87
Something you know

459
00:31:34,87 --> 00:31:38,69
that you can i don't know if it can ever
be reproduced which is why you know i

460
00:31:38,69 --> 00:31:42,62
think i'd be i'd really like it if
i had kids to my kids to do that

461
00:31:42,62 --> 00:31:47,61
and i just don't know if that would
ever be able to happen but that whole.

462
00:31:47,63 --> 00:31:53,55
Maybe i know the whole energy the everything
just was so even though it was new

463
00:31:53,55 --> 00:31:54,64
and even though things went wrong.

464
00:31:55,08 --> 00:31:58,32
It wasn't a problem and i think
that joe and i now carry that.
