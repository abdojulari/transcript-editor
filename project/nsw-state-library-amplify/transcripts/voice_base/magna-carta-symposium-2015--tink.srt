An expat is Andrew take after eight years as a barrister followed by nineteen years as a member of the New South Wales

and I B I should say CIA away from the award for literature in two thousand

and fifteen Andrew commits to three year appointment as president of the lottery Council the south while he's going to

14
00:01:15,23 --> 00:01:22,26
be talking to us the soft unknown on the subject of Magna Carta is round about relevance to early New South Wales

15
00:01:22,41 --> 00:01:29,3
and I'd ask you to welcome him thank.

16
00:01:32,43 --> 00:01:37,91
Thanks very much diverted look there's one thing that I need to explain and that is so I've had radiation for cancer

17
00:01:37,92 --> 00:01:44,38
and I get a very dry mouth so to drink from this bottle with on but it can Times water not alcohol.

18
00:01:48,02 --> 00:01:49,3
According to the Philosopher

19
00:01:49,31 --> 00:01:57,6
and jurist Jeremy Bentham the detention of what he called explored convicts in the colonies was a breach of Magna Carta

20
00:01:58,08 --> 00:02:01,46
which he said applauded New South while. As well as in England.

21
00:02:02,63 --> 00:02:06,72
Such was Bentham's prominence in the light and early not a centuries

22
00:02:07,12 --> 00:02:13,58
but are expected to find numerous references to Magna Carta in the early colonial records of New South whiles

23
00:02:13,88 --> 00:02:15,93
especially the early court cases.

24
00:02:17,26 --> 00:02:20,43
Diving clock mention the waiting case of fighting twenty seven

25
00:02:20,58 --> 00:02:27,68
when the Zonda stood him it was the presiding magistrate who literally saying Magna Carta is prices not the litigant

26
00:02:28,41 --> 00:02:34,46
but apart from this I couldn't find any mention of Magna Carta you know either the cush or reports

27
00:02:34,69 --> 00:02:41,36
or Dowling select is which between them cover many of the court reports between seven billion ID ite

28
00:02:41,55 --> 00:02:49,18
and I Ding forty three given these striving in Senate swep saw I climbs that Magna Carta reason much quoted by strident

29
00:02:49,19 --> 00:02:56,02
when they're representing themselves in court cases I wondered why their ancestors didn't appear to do a lot more lies

30
00:02:56,45 --> 00:03:02,45
perhaps I was smart a litigant seen person that knows more modern litigants that die the clock referred to a little bit

31
00:03:02,46 --> 00:03:07,94
earlier that fellow in court coins land to say you had to coin something.

32
00:03:09,24 --> 00:03:12,06
At one level it can be argued that Bentham was wrong

33
00:03:12,4 --> 00:03:18,13
and that it was nothing in our the transportation act of seventy ninety four the active part of the status in New South

34
00:03:18,14 --> 00:03:24,68
Wales which prevented a convict term expired from returning to England other than the extreme distance

35
00:03:24,69 --> 00:03:26,24
and great expense involved

36
00:03:26,77 --> 00:03:32,91
but that does not necessarily explain in the absence of other references to the great shot at you know the new South

37
00:03:32,92 --> 00:03:40,77
whiles what might help to do so is the fact that from as early as July seventh I the common Lords applauded the convict

38
00:03:40,78 --> 00:03:48,25
colony head in a kiddie respect lept I hated that applaud in England so we've bought clothes thirty Nawin of Magna

39
00:03:48,26 --> 00:03:55,12
Carta as agreed to by King John in twelve fifteen there was an acknowledgement of the primacy of the common law

40
00:03:55,38 --> 00:03:59,98
and this was recognised as one of the minor ongoing legacies of the settlement.

41
00:04:00,01 --> 00:04:00,81
Between the king

42
00:04:00,82 --> 00:04:08,62
and his barons at Runnymede then in some wise from its earliest dies earliest colonial dies New South Wiles was ahead

43
00:04:08,63 --> 00:04:13,77
of England when a kind of fundamental rights had been this be so

44
00:04:13,92 --> 00:04:18,41
when an examination of rather early colonial records such as newspaper reports

45
00:04:18,42 --> 00:04:20,95
and dispatches between New South Wales officials

46
00:04:21,21 --> 00:04:26,41
and the British government reveals that there's nothing about Magna Carta or until twenty seven

47
00:04:26,79 --> 00:04:30,27
and then on the a few mentions the police are out by I think thirty one.

48
00:04:31,94 --> 00:04:33,38
In my view the

49
00:04:33,39 --> 00:04:39,96
and so last principally with Lord Sidney who was probably responsible sending the First Fleet to botany by

50
00:04:40,44 --> 00:04:45,17
and with the convict colonies first and fifth governess to Philip unlocked

51
00:04:45,18 --> 00:04:48,78
and McQuarrie large Sydney that are in Lawton Maine.

52
00:04:50,29 --> 00:04:53,84
Over the last light hundred years the importance of Magna Carta has waxed

53
00:04:53,85 --> 00:05:00,47
and wind the summit continues to be the defining recognition of ancient liberties reaching back at least the time of it

54
00:05:00,48 --> 00:05:06,42
with the confessed up for others the great shot it was never more than a tenuous place truly between King John

55
00:05:06,68 --> 00:05:08,31
and his rebellious barons

56
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:15,14
but even this more strict it view employed a direct challenge to King John's climb to rule by divine right

57
00:05:15,71 --> 00:05:22,43
and it was the Stuart Kings climbs to rule by the will of God alone in the seventeenth century which guy Magna Carta

58
00:05:22,44 --> 00:05:27,06
renewed relevance when Charles the Second asserted in the sixteen I.T.S.

59
00:05:27,35 --> 00:05:29,05
That God had put him on the throne

60
00:05:29,06 --> 00:05:37,06
and I only God could remove him it was Lord Sydney's great right Uncle Algernon Sidney with an eye who counted in

61
00:05:37,07 --> 00:05:43,77
discourses concerning government that quote the peril regionally in the people of England is delegated into the power

62
00:05:43,78 --> 00:05:46,08
of men and we might therefore Chinese

63
00:05:46,09 --> 00:05:56,16
or Tycho white kings in discourses Sydney laws specifically on Magna Carta to support his proposition that to depend on

64
00:05:56,17 --> 00:05:59,98
the will of a man is sly free Sidney said the intent.

65
00:06:00,27 --> 00:06:08,64
Variances this was without doubt to establish this among us by Magna Carta similarly to Granny's assertion that laws

66
00:06:08,65 --> 00:06:12,63
are not my boy kings because nice ones will be governed by a rule

67
00:06:12,64 --> 00:06:17,64
and not really Sidney wrote The Great shot of that recapitulates

68
00:06:17,65 --> 00:06:24,04
and acknowledges their rights in inherently bodies applaud just the king to swear that he will not have the sill to lie

69
00:06:24,05 --> 00:06:28,24
in order not justice to any man according to the laws of the land.

70
00:06:29,37 --> 00:06:31,01
For writing discourses

71
00:06:31,23 --> 00:06:36,37
and they have boy daring to challenge King Charles a second's climb to rule by divine rule out right.

72
00:06:37,5 --> 00:06:40,39
Sydney was tried for treason and found guilty

73
00:06:40,83 --> 00:06:48,17
and on the seventh of December sixth he was beheaded there are after they become a moderate hero to those who believe

74
00:06:48,18 --> 00:06:55,47
that the will of more not should be subject to the will of Polman among them Tommy Townsend a drop of the blood of

suffering setbacks during these early power Mantri career as a government hack always one of those once upon a time

77
00:07:12,14 --> 00:07:19,48
Townsend began to support radical causes among them that of John Wilkes who had been repeatedly expelled from power

78
00:07:19,49 --> 00:07:24,98
meant for defaming King George the third Good to be repeatedly reelected boy's constituents.

79
00:07:26,29 --> 00:07:31,84
To perfect the plan of securing and guiding the liberties of the freest nice in the world against the future attacks

and that election a line. Is the author of the American Declaration of Independence.

84
00:08:00,01 --> 00:08:01,94
Thomas Jefferson Leiter acknowledged.

85
00:08:03,11 --> 00:08:10,76
Algernon Sydney a billion one of these inspirations in discourses Sydney it is that nothing can be more evident than

86
00:08:10,77 --> 00:08:19,53
that of many manage being created equal mirroring this in his declaration Jefferson famously proclaimed We hold these

87
00:08:19,54 --> 00:08:27,24
truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal Alsono in Sydney is very very bright political philosopher

88
00:08:27,25 --> 00:08:33,72
indeed not understood these dice because it was impossible to really which is to cite was a great think about a bad

89
00:08:33,73 --> 00:08:36,82
writer if you want to be remembered well.

90
00:08:40,71 --> 00:08:47,97
During the American Revolutionary War Tommy Townsend remind Truda Algernon Sidney's principles bowing among just a

91
00:08:47,98 --> 00:08:55,53
handful of members of the House of Commons who strongly backed the revolted American colonists as George the third like

92
00:08:55,54 --> 00:09:02,39
to call them all wrong McLean the new British government which emerged on to the war Tommy Townsend because I'm home

93
00:09:02,4 --> 00:09:06,85
secretary responsible for negotiating a peace treaty with the Americans.

94
00:09:08,75 --> 00:09:12,48
Is if it's to provide for American loyalists the king Often him a peerage

95
00:09:12,8 --> 00:09:19,54
and that why Tommy towns in the kind lowered Sydney then off the United States refused to accept any more British

96
00:09:19,55 --> 00:09:23,1
convicts it felt Lloyd Sydney to find an alternative.

97
00:09:24,38 --> 00:09:29,14
Refusing to adopt Jeremy Bentham spree puzzle to build a jaunt penitentiary

98
00:09:29,24 --> 00:09:36,24
or pan up the can so cold because it allowed a single watchman to observe all the inmates with at the end might spring

99
00:09:36,25 --> 00:09:43,59
I will tell whether that obeying watched Sydney settled on a resumption of transportation this time to botany by.

100
00:09:45,1 --> 00:09:50,31
The stewards of the transportation act of seventy ninety four which Lord Sydney to help to sponsor the British

101
00:09:50,32 --> 00:09:58,1
Parliament convict oversea is quite could inflict such moderate punishment as might be inflicted boil on persons

102
00:09:58,11 --> 00:09:59,81
committed to a house of correction.

103
00:10:00,33 --> 00:10:05,63
So the convicts had substantial wrought sound of British law just as they arrive as cities had substantial

104
00:10:05,64 --> 00:10:12,36
responsibilities and as is now being generally accepted by a story and generous provision was might for the.

105
00:10:13,83 --> 00:10:15,52
Governor Philip kept

106
00:10:15,53 --> 00:10:21,62
and what contains sport it was left to acting Tallie from resigned judgement without the benefit of a council

107
00:10:21,71 --> 00:10:28,79
or other legal arrangements more in the spirit of Magna Carta he had been a he had been agreed to by Sydney

108
00:10:28,8 --> 00:10:34,05
and Philip to the constant sort of the legal arrangements more in the spirit of Magna Carta had been agreed to by

109
00:10:34,06 --> 00:10:34,47
Sydney

110
00:10:34,48 --> 00:10:40,99
and Philip to the consternation of the First Lord of the Admiralty among these was an instruction of the convicts would

111
00:10:41,00 --> 00:10:48,26
be subject to the ordinary criminal law and not to the hotshoe middle military law which applied to the Marines

112
00:10:48,58 --> 00:10:55,22
and pursuant to let us patent would Sydney established a court of civil jurisdiction which could hear an action upon

113
00:10:55,23 --> 00:10:57,73
complaint to be might in writing to the court

114
00:10:57,98 --> 00:11:04,98
or any personal persons against any other personal persons residing wellbeing within the said place of any cause.

115
00:11:07,76 --> 00:11:14,74
He's a story that will strike what these millions implying which. Is the first Floyd was bullying my ready.

116
00:11:16,07 --> 00:11:23,89
Convicts were handed over to the master of the convict transport boy they July John Simpson one of them six Susanna

117
00:11:23,9 --> 00:11:33,61
Holmes was accompanied by her infant son who the master of the transport refused to allow on board a pole that mother

118
00:11:33,67 --> 00:11:40,05
and child would be separated because the child of course hadn't been convicted of an offense in the didn't have any

119
00:11:40,06 --> 00:11:41,5
legal Bice's to tyke him.

120
00:11:42,66 --> 00:11:47,5
Simpson took the infant and rode up to London where he hoped to remonstrate with somebody

121
00:11:47,51 --> 00:11:55,39
and I'm office upon arrival Simpson bumped into Lloyd Sydney so the Home Office was very small just four rooms on the

122
00:11:55,4 --> 00:11:59,98
first floor of a rinky dink building in want hole and unli for him.

123
00:12:00,08 --> 00:12:02,7
Floyd by the Home Office including the secretary of state

124
00:12:02,71 --> 00:12:09,04
and the lighting I ran the British am Paul the most the internal government right Britain I got into

125
00:12:09,05 --> 00:12:11,91
when you station on the wire hand there most of the night and people running

126
00:12:11,92 --> 00:12:14,15
when you'd station something's not quite right.

127
00:12:15,92 --> 00:12:22,39
Size Simpson bumped into a load seen him silf it was quickly convinced to sign the pipe as that would allow the infant

128
00:12:22,4 --> 00:12:23,58
to accompany its mother

129
00:12:24,45 --> 00:12:30,75
and almost as an officer what he saw on pipe was allowing the by the father a convict by the name of Henry Cavill to go

130
00:12:30,86 --> 00:12:34,8
to the person got hold of his story and Kibo homes

131
00:12:34,81 --> 00:12:41,35
and they buy be quickly become celebrities so much so that the public dynamited to a trust fund to help them on a wider

132
00:12:41,36 --> 00:12:47,63
botany by in their wisdom the trustees put his clothes and books which were placed in a Haitian sack

133
00:12:47,64 --> 00:12:52,3
and loaded onto the transport Alexandra the Khyber on another vessel

134
00:12:52,99 --> 00:13:00,47
when Khyber went to collect the sack after arriving at Sydney he was told by the Alexanders Masjid Duncan Sinclair that

135
00:13:00,48 --> 00:13:01,68
the clothes that gone missing

136
00:13:01,69 --> 00:13:06,95
and I knew the books could be found Meanwhile the court of civil jurisdiction had been a step wished

137
00:13:07,34 --> 00:13:11,27
and so after typing advice Kai will sued Sinclair for damages

138
00:13:11,98 --> 00:13:18,36
and following a three day hearing in early July seventh a ninety I presided over by the judge advocate David Collins

139
00:13:18,7 --> 00:13:27,45
Kibo was awarded fifteen pounds in damages so it was that in Cairo versus single at the first civil suit brought in a

140
00:13:27,46 --> 00:13:35,21
strike a convict successfully sued the monster of a first fleet transport for lost luggage you wouldn't do as well as

141
00:13:35,22 --> 00:13:37,28
that to die if you took on course.

142
00:13:39,59 --> 00:13:44,9
As a convict on the sentence Khyber would have been and I will bring these climb for damages in England

143
00:13:45,76 --> 00:13:48,69
but in the convict colony different rules were applied

144
00:13:48,86 --> 00:13:54,84
and in this why the common law which laws at the heart of Magna Carta was more advanced in the convict call

145
00:13:54,85 --> 00:13:59,45
and even it was in the all country it's on really critically important story.

146
00:14:00,76 --> 00:14:07,67
Even in the face of general stop I shouldn't govern I know so I should say that I do agree with John who is the we've

147
00:14:07,68 --> 00:14:11,56
got to do something about the plot and in Canberra it's not wrong.

148
00:14:12,81 --> 00:14:18,09
Even in the face of general starvation Governor Philip exercised these enormous past wisely

149
00:14:18,53 --> 00:14:24,88
and this combined with these personal examples such as accepting the convict Russian help the colony to survive just as

150
00:14:24,89 --> 00:14:30,63
important was the judicious use of the PAL would see the need given him to emancipate well behaved convicts

151
00:14:30,64 --> 00:14:31,82
and grant them land

152
00:14:32,47 --> 00:14:38,7
when Phillip the part of the seven day ninety two he handed I have a temporary control of the rum colcannon DA this I

153
00:14:38,71 --> 00:14:41,22
should in years of instability as light

154
00:14:41,23 --> 00:14:46,42
and I will govern a struggle to was there a thorough by now politically entrenched coal

155
00:14:46,67 --> 00:14:51,68
and its fellow traveller is according to Jeffrey Watson down I see I see there's still a lot of

156
00:14:51,69 --> 00:14:52,83
and well some allies played.

157
00:14:53,94 --> 00:14:58,13
The simmering tensions finally climaxed on the twenty sixth of January

158
00:14:59,12 --> 00:15:05,04
when the ram coal command of my johnson arrested governable on a ship in government at a time

159
00:15:05,05 --> 00:15:10,49
when Britain was fighting for its lot of guys the French this decided the least was a risky strategy

160
00:15:11,11 --> 00:15:18,29
and so on surprisingly Johnson my no specific reference to Magna Carta The justify himself even so he's dispatched of

161
00:15:18,3 --> 00:15:20,97
account Council right had a familiar ring to it.

162
00:15:22,32 --> 00:15:29,31
Calvin a blog tried the high trust and confidence reposed in bars sovereign and acted up on a pro to term

163
00:15:29,32 --> 00:15:34,52
and plan to subvert the laws of his country to terrify and influence the courts of justice

164
00:15:34,75 --> 00:15:39,34
and the persons who had the misfortune to be of noxious to him of the fortunes the liberty

165
00:15:39,35 --> 00:15:46,7
and the laws one act of oppression was succeeded by until a general sense isin of alignment terror profile throughout

166
00:15:46,71 --> 00:15:47,46
the settlements.

167
00:15:48,81 --> 00:15:56,48
Johnson to council right if King John had not so on the Magna Kadar in twelve fifteen the barons model of drawing up

168
00:15:56,49 --> 00:15:59,98
something similar. Notwithstanding the Sion any.

169
00:16:00,01 --> 00:16:06,31
It's between the early governors in the colonies political factions many inhabitants of doing doing well in no small

170
00:16:06,32 --> 00:16:11,21
part to the Polje to the policy Lord seed needs sitting trying of emancipation and land grants

171
00:16:11,59 --> 00:16:12,66
and thanks to the in-laws

172
00:16:12,67 --> 00:16:19,87
and inside of the colonies fifth governor Laughlin McQuarrie recognized in a new policy which head on sure this is

173
00:16:19,88 --> 00:16:27,02
right had now president in England so this is another example of the colony the convict calling looping ahead of them

174
00:16:27,03 --> 00:16:27,63
of a country

175
00:16:27,64 --> 00:16:34,28
when it comes to fundamental rights on the thirtieth of by providing tain McCoury right to vote I can't council write

176
00:16:34,69 --> 00:16:42,2
off Teigen upon myself to adopt a new law of conduct conduct conceding that conceiving that emancipation

177
00:16:42,21 --> 00:16:43,67
when you nodded with rectitude

178
00:16:43,68 --> 00:16:49,33
and long Troy good conduct should lead a man back to the rank of society which it full fitted

179
00:16:49,7 --> 00:16:57,57
and do a why in his far as the case will admit already respect for my bad conduct he supposed to me to be the greatest

180
00:16:57,58 --> 00:17:02,1
inducement that could be held there towards the reformation of the manners of the inhabitants

181
00:17:02,46 --> 00:17:09,18
and I think it is consistent with the gracious fiber of this class of people Corey then explained that he allowed for

182
00:17:09,19 --> 00:17:09,37
X.

183
00:17:09,38 --> 00:17:16,14
Convicts to dawn with him the principal surgeon dasi Wentworth He's assistant William Redfern the prosperous farmer in

184
00:17:16,15 --> 00:17:18,04
the land Andrew Thomson

185
00:17:18,32 --> 00:17:25,15
and the wealthy merchant Simeon low wall Wentworth had never in fact playing convicted of anything it was widely

186
00:17:25,16 --> 00:17:28,78
believed that he was a next Harlem and not without reason on one side.

187
00:17:30,01 --> 00:17:35,25
I have long conducted themselves with the greatest propriety McCoury said No I find them at all times ready to come

188
00:17:35,26 --> 00:17:39,92
forward the most liberal man it was the systems of government to award this McCoury

189
00:17:39,93 --> 00:17:45,55
and bars to beat a point in Thompson as a magistrate in the Hawkesbury and he would soon appoint Wentworth

190
00:17:45,59 --> 00:17:53,54
and Lord as magistrate seen Sydney had Jeremy Bentham span up the can being built it's difficult to imagine that would

191
00:17:53,58 --> 00:17:59,98
ever of to live it fully reform convicts on the skyll now contemplated by government quarry nor would.

192
00:18:00,97 --> 00:18:08,17
Led to see it as magistrates in England I'm sure I'm writing sign in this why the administration of lore in the colony

193
00:18:08,18 --> 00:18:10,09
had a lip that England

194
00:18:10,47 --> 00:18:18,51
but the prospect of being judged boy offended many of the cycle exclusive for a setlist I'm not sure that if I go hold

195
00:18:18,52 --> 00:18:25,3
up before a magistrate in Paramount of all I would be very happy if I knew the irony that a name like.

196
00:18:29,7 --> 00:18:34,05
That I never catch their objections these are the exclusive for the set was playing just boy.

197
00:18:35,2 --> 00:18:43,57
They never cast their objections in terms of Magna Carta close thirty nine of the twelfth edition we would have allowed

198
00:18:43,58 --> 00:18:49,83
them to do so and I for a man should be persuaded against it says except for the lawful judgment of these pieces.

199
00:18:51,01 --> 00:18:56,55
Nevertheless the exclusives objected to London the batiks convict magistrates in there and why

200
00:18:57,08 --> 00:19:01,75
and as a result Commissioner John Big was appointed to inquire into the McCoury administration

201
00:19:02,16 --> 00:19:05,04
but the governor didn't help him so when he to forward the commission

202
00:19:05,48 --> 00:19:08,68
and appointed another ex-con William Redfern to the bench.

203
00:19:10,07 --> 00:19:16,75
It was Das he went with son William Charles Wentworth who made the first comprehensive piece for constitutional reform

204
00:19:16,76 --> 00:19:17,85
of the convict colony.

205
00:19:18,98 --> 00:19:25,37
In a statistical historical and political description of the colony of New South whiles a book written

206
00:19:25,38 --> 00:19:32,07
and published in England a night a night went with proposed the introduction of Troll Boy jury a free press

207
00:19:32,25 --> 00:19:36,07
and elected legislature and an independent supreme court

208
00:19:36,96 --> 00:19:43,71
but nowhere in this book of almost five hundred pages is there a reference to Magna Carta rather resolve humans for

209
00:19:43,72 --> 00:19:51,14
putting more general terms it's a fundamental maxim of the British constitution went with right that no taxes should be

210
00:19:51,15 --> 00:19:58,76
levied on the subject without his consent expressed voice Representatives even to this maxim the rod is in directly

211
00:19:58,77 --> 00:20:04,56
from clause twelve of a. Right shot of that's the one of a story twelfth which begins.

212
00:20:05,84 --> 00:20:12,93
That society was in a military tax nice good age no rights will be imposed on at Kingdom unless part Common Council of

213
00:20:12,94 --> 00:20:17,82
that kingdom which is a no taxation without representation. And.

214
00:20:20,02 --> 00:20:27,8
Argument according to some following on from Commission a big reports uniting twenty two an independent Supreme Court

215
00:20:27,81 --> 00:20:31,32
was established limited Troll Boy jury was implemented

216
00:20:31,6 --> 00:20:38,58
and appointed Legislative Council was established to Cory successor Thomas Brisbane also introduce what he called the

217
00:20:38,59 --> 00:20:41,17
experiment of the four letter to the freedom of the press

218
00:20:41,72 --> 00:20:48,15
and she supplied English concessions in the second edition of each book went with the written in the Mind on its

219
00:20:48,16 --> 00:20:54,47
probable with all these privileges which the author has contended for will be considered accepting perhaps full trial

220
00:20:54,48 --> 00:20:57,76
by jury and the establishment of a house of assembly

221
00:20:58,17 --> 00:21:04,36
and if these privileges withheld little longer it will only be from the conviction of the colony hasn't yet Iran

222
00:21:04,49 --> 00:21:08,84
sufficient degree but you're ready for the reception an exercise of them.

223
00:21:11,18 --> 00:21:17,75
The granting of these further constitutional concessions was ultimately an issue for the British government and pollen.

224
00:21:18,98 --> 00:21:25,51
And having been taught a lesson by the revolt of American colonists less than half a century earlier it was a matter of

225
00:21:25,52 --> 00:21:26,7
when not if.

226
00:21:28,99 --> 00:21:29,44
Jury

227
00:21:29,45 --> 00:21:37,14
and elected legislature would be introduced However while a man supposed legal for these Chinese assoon as possible some

228
00:21:37,15 --> 00:21:44,62
exclusives for the vigorous regard the lying action motivated especially by the prospect of being judged by juries of

229
00:21:44,63 --> 00:21:44,82
X.

230
00:21:44,83 --> 00:21:53,23
Convex another complication was Gov Brisbane successor Ralph dolling a prickly military mot net who broadly that any

231
00:21:53,24 --> 00:21:59,98
criticism of his administration of the colonies now often pointed newspaper editorials indeed it was the convict.

232
00:22:00,19 --> 00:22:01,51
Conflict between dolling

233
00:22:01,52 --> 00:22:08,42
and those pushing for reform which triggered the only direct official reference I could find on Magna Carta up to white

234
00:22:08,43 --> 00:22:13,4
in forty four to petition the king in both houses of parliament full trial by jury

235
00:22:13,41 --> 00:22:20,86
and elected legislature a public meeting was held at Sydney's courthouse on the twenty sixth general twenty seven there

236
00:22:20,87 --> 00:22:27,58
are a large crowd was addressed by William Charles Wentworth these Constitutional Rights belong as much to the people

237
00:22:27,82 --> 00:22:32,59
as the crown belong to the king he said I was a birthright of the people and nothing

238
00:22:32,6 --> 00:22:40,13
but the strongest necessity could justify withholding them an instant So the petition itself set out to show why there

239
00:22:40,14 --> 00:22:47,27
was not just this no such necessity withhold them any further in relation to jury trials the petitions were careful to

240
00:22:47,28 --> 00:22:55,00
point out that the competency for trial by jury has been proved boy upwards of two years' experience in that mode of

241
00:22:55,01 --> 00:23:02,8
trial in the colonies courts of Quarter Sessions therefore the inference was that to extend it to all jury trials

242
00:23:02,81 --> 00:23:09,59
carried very little risk it would be any incremental China which it was in relation to the call for an elected

243
00:23:09,6 --> 00:23:16,41
legislature of the petition involved to grant China referring to the colonies annual revenue of sixty thousand pounds

244
00:23:16,73 --> 00:23:23,16
the petition is quite this enormous sum this isn't here the two billion levied on your Majesty's humble petition is

245
00:23:23,17 --> 00:23:28,24
both already of power meant that other was without their consent contra to Magna Carta

246
00:23:28,53 --> 00:23:31,19
and that ended the dispatches back to.

247
00:23:32,45 --> 00:23:38,5
England as an excuse to the governor as official dispatches to the well by then colonial secretary

248
00:23:38,91 --> 00:23:40,69
and that's how it was in the official record.

249
00:23:42,02 --> 00:23:46,95
While the editor of Sydney's monitor news Piper described as contrary to an expressed quote was in Magna.

250
00:23:48,78 --> 00:23:53,83
My view is that it isn't based on a bleak reference to close twelve which I mentioned earlier.

251
00:23:54,85 --> 00:23:59,68
Whatever the case the petition then addressed itself to the practical matter of whether they are enough people.

252
00:24:00,06 --> 00:24:03,55
The call only qualified to stand for election their idea.

253
00:24:04,78 --> 00:24:07,5
Of the magistrate magistracies the petition argued

254
00:24:07,74 --> 00:24:11,13
and three times as many gentlemen who will take will be fitted by their will

255
00:24:11,17 --> 00:24:17,96
and talents to act as members of alleged to the assembly such a Govern a darling unimpressed

256
00:24:18,16 --> 00:24:23,41
and he's covering dispatch which accompanied the petition of the Colonial Secretary Lord Bathurst presentation to the

257
00:24:23,42 --> 00:24:30,97
king darling said it started of in infancy at present reigned in New South Wales unfit for those institutions which in

258
00:24:30,98 --> 00:24:33,47
England as a result of its advancement

259
00:24:33,48 --> 00:24:40,25
and maturity now then anticipating this went with a swing to what the copies of the petition would be taken to London

260
00:24:40,26 --> 00:24:41,43
by Gregory Blaxland

261
00:24:41,7 --> 00:24:48,95
and they are presented to sympathizers in bypass of Palma as the editor of the city morning monitor put it Lord

262
00:24:48,96 --> 00:24:51,67
Bathurst is not as cold he will towards the house of the same.

263
00:24:52,94 --> 00:24:56,91
We're glad therefore the parliament is Billion petitioned as well as the king.

264
00:24:59,09 --> 00:25:02,94
Live this campaign for constitutional reform had some years left to run.

265
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:08,18
I could only find to read lighter references to Magna Carta up to white in forty three

266
00:25:08,54 --> 00:25:15,63
but which time trial by jury in a posh elected legislature introduced into New South whiles the first reference was in

267
00:25:15,64 --> 00:25:21,87
a letter to the Sidney is it published in the thirteenth of August twenty nine quoting the letter

268
00:25:21,88 --> 00:25:25,16
and version of Magna Carta schools thirty nine of the.

269
00:25:26,18 --> 00:25:33,18
Twelve edition there are derived that the free born children of a man's a man suppose should have the benefits of

270
00:25:33,19 --> 00:25:34,66
unlimited trial by jury.

271
00:25:35,81 --> 00:25:41,98
And the second reference appeared in an article in the stride in the thirtieth of July thirty climbing that upon the

272
00:25:41,99 --> 00:25:48,76
principle of Magna Carter a verdict of twelve main is to be a verdict of law the piper criticized

273
00:25:48,77 --> 00:25:55,00
and identified court judgment on the BY says that a positive jury verdict for the defendant had been replaced by a

274
00:25:55,01 --> 00:25:59,98
special verdict of the judge this was in fact a reference to the items.

275
00:26:00,8 --> 00:26:08,96
Of pine number two according to the official court report the attorney general had a lab the case to go to the jury

276
00:26:08,97 --> 00:26:14,46
and I found a verdict for the defendant against the direction of the judges who ruled that upon the playthings the

277
00:26:14,47 --> 00:26:19,87
crown was in top of the judgment the defendants barristers Wardell and Wentworth that's W.

278
00:26:19,88 --> 00:26:26,52
So he went with admitted on appeal that in strictness of law the defendant not might add any total against the Crown

279
00:26:26,8 --> 00:26:33,54
but instead that iniquity the verdict stood as the colonies to foreigners barristers Richard Wardo

280
00:26:33,58 --> 00:26:40,32
and William Charles Wentworth must have known that their argument would not succeed so perhaps it's no coincidence that

281
00:26:40,33 --> 00:26:46,29
the appeal to Magna Carta appeared without attribution in a news pipe which Wardell

282
00:26:46,33 --> 00:26:49,2
and went with had founded back in twenty four.

283
00:26:50,84 --> 00:26:56,52
All are specific to references to Magna Carta during the convict colonies first dies a few

284
00:26:56,53 --> 00:27:05,54
and far between the nine of the last man to be executed for invoking it has been celebrated since the twenty second of

285
00:27:05,55 --> 00:27:07,57
January seventeenth night

286
00:27:07,84 --> 00:27:15,44
when Governor Philip nine Sydney after the home secretary Lord Sidney half so well thought of you

287
00:27:15,9 --> 00:27:22,00
when he'd been offered a peerage for his role in securing a peace treaty with the revolt of American colonists the home

288
00:27:22,01 --> 00:27:29,5
secretary then still known as Tommy Townsend charged the nine Sydney for the top will in on are of these revealed

289
00:27:29,51 --> 00:27:34,12
and Algernon Sidney Algernon Sidney with and on.

290
00:27:35,93 --> 00:27:40,1
So why is there a difference in the spelling between Sydney's we now with the law

291
00:27:40,11 --> 00:27:46,2
and Sydney with the on in fact first proposed Sydney with a no i did George the third

292
00:27:46,81 --> 00:27:53,34
but then he discovered what he called the elder branches of his family might have a climb on it so he rode to the king

293
00:27:53,35 --> 00:27:59,98
a stall lies the consideration of the toilets occupies my thoughts no farther than to avoid taking.

294
00:28:00,15 --> 00:28:07,91
Anyone which might clash with the pretensions of any other family if your Majesty will allow me to Chinese the toilets

295
00:28:07,92 --> 00:28:13,45
of Sydney with a wife sitting with a wall of chisel Hirst neither of which a climb boy anybody

296
00:28:13,95 --> 00:28:16,74
and to which on the law I'd bar the Sydney's in the V.

297
00:28:16,75 --> 00:28:24,72
Is one hundred more relatives will be satisfied in that all offend nobody else in this roundabout why then the I'm a

298
00:28:24,73 --> 00:28:32,94
BAD RIGHT city celebrates Algernon Sidney the last man to be modded for invoking Magna Carta against an absolute as

299
00:28:32,95 --> 00:28:40,44
British King thank you. Thank you.
