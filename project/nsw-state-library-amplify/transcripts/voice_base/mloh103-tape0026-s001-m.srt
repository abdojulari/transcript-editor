1
00:00:14,07 --> 00:00:20,19
Like a just. So yes. Whoever's i have to
say i have to say that again. All right.

2
00:00:20,32 --> 00:00:26,11
Well so we had a an old man a mr.
smith who was about to retire

3
00:00:26,11 --> 00:00:30,27
and he decided he'd buy the smallest
post-office he could find and retire.

4
00:00:30,41 --> 00:00:34,20
So of course he bought the neiman post-office
and ended up up here in the heyday.

5
00:00:34,32 --> 00:00:36,55
When the town was starting to boom

6
00:00:36,55 --> 00:00:40,78
and he would get the most ridiculous
letters addressed to people like rainbow

7
00:00:40,78 --> 00:00:44,87
and the treehouse tangible
falls and he by the end of it.

8
00:00:44,90 --> 00:00:48,87
He was quite spare he could do high blood
pressure he was really quite that easy.

9
00:00:48,96 --> 00:00:51,62
And yet one morning i remember
walking into the post office

10
00:00:51,62 --> 00:00:52,83
and he was throwing a tantrum

11
00:00:53,74 --> 00:00:56,52
and he had hauled someone across
the counter by their shirt collar

12
00:00:56,52 --> 00:01:00,86
and was you know screaming abuse at them
and he had another man at work for him.

13
00:01:00,91 --> 00:01:06,21
Named nole who was no he was
so mild mannered and then

14
00:01:06,21 --> 00:01:09,37
when just chucked the wobblies and
knowledge kind of look stone faced

15
00:01:09,37 --> 00:01:12,35
that you're not i said to
know how you deal with it.

16
00:01:12,36 --> 00:01:15,37
You know i couldn't stand and he said
i'll wait until it's no it around.

17
00:01:15,56 --> 00:01:18,55
I go out onto the back step
and i piss myself laughing

18
00:01:21,31 --> 00:01:25,61
and you know you know you died a
couple years ago it was very sad.

19
00:01:25,63 --> 00:01:27,49
He was there you know
going to the post office

20
00:01:27,49 --> 00:01:32,30
and make love with no you cross
the cancer with darling.

21
00:01:32,32 --> 00:01:38,74
He's not do them but who is really going
through this food but mr smith retired

22
00:01:38,74 --> 00:01:42,97
and sold it to another for poor unfortunate
man who now gets abused i think in many

23
00:01:42,97 --> 00:01:46,81
other day when been abused by some
very out of it looking character.

24
00:01:47,42 --> 00:01:48,15
You know

25
00:01:48,15 --> 00:01:55,00
and just to think what the wild
west can be at times can't

26
00:01:55,00 --> 00:01:59,69
can be very and it seems to be cyclic to
you know devices it's just gorgeous and.

27
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,33
Couldn't have ever imagined
live anywhere else

28
00:02:03,20 --> 00:02:07,77
and other days you think i have to seriously
consider the direction of my life

29
00:02:09,91 --> 00:02:16,59
where i come from the money.

30
00:02:17,52 --> 00:02:19,58
So you and your friends
go overseas interests

31
00:02:19,58 --> 00:02:25,78
and i think i'm so bored.

32
00:02:28,33 --> 00:02:34,40
So that you know but. I
consider it like people.

33
00:02:34,60 --> 00:02:35,56
Oh yes.

34
00:02:35,86 --> 00:02:42,45
When we first started the rainbow cafe it
wasn't as it appears to this day it had

35
00:02:42,45 --> 00:02:46,42
little rooms that was still you know
had their partitions and things

36
00:02:47,29 --> 00:02:51,31
and every saturday we would have to vacate
one of these little rooms at the back

37
00:02:52,20 --> 00:02:53,36
and this can come in.

38
00:02:53,51 --> 00:02:56,31
Plugged his phone in and
the way he'd go and

39
00:02:56,31 --> 00:03:00,01
when we realized what he was drinkers
used to try and keep us locked down

40
00:03:00,01 --> 00:03:01,64
but we would just tease him.

41
00:03:02,16 --> 00:03:05,19
Open the door and pretend to
put on be so to the police

42
00:03:05,19 --> 00:03:09,36
but there are no fears
me i won't get changed

43
00:03:09,36 --> 00:03:14,11
and things like this because we saw so have
to back at bath out on another part of

44
00:03:14,11 --> 00:03:19,62
the back verandah there because by using
facilities were fairly scarce it was very

45
00:03:19,62 --> 00:03:26,45
good for local baker he was the local
baker who became very very wealthy from

46
00:03:26,45 --> 00:03:28,80
having it up a lot of the land around here

47
00:03:28,80 --> 00:03:31,83
and he knew after he was a
bakery sell the baker bakery

48
00:03:31,83 --> 00:03:34,91
and they became a real estate agent
and cleaned up and then moved.

49
00:03:34,96 --> 00:03:41,14
Thank you very much it killing.

50
00:03:41,15 --> 00:03:44,94
Oh yeah yeah well we don't you
know we don't know we don't know

51
00:03:44,94 --> 00:03:51,43
that really i think is making it

52
00:03:52,24 --> 00:03:55,19
any time for the bakery or he
owned by people and we live here

53
00:03:55,19 --> 00:03:57,65
and so during the best of all
the people from the feed.

54
00:03:57,70 --> 00:03:59,67
Well family gave him a recipe for.

55
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,21
Loaf which became the aquarius
known and he baked that

56
00:04:03,21 --> 00:04:06,59
and sold it all around the area and
each time the bakery had been sold

57
00:04:06,59 --> 00:04:09,66
that recipe is part of the deal.

58
00:04:09,68 --> 00:04:11,72
I think they change it
every time a changed hands

59
00:04:11,72 --> 00:04:15,76
that doesn't really resemble
anything like what i used to know.

60
00:04:15,78 --> 00:04:18,20
But it was all made with organic grain

61
00:04:18,20 --> 00:04:23,19
and it was very tasty.

62
00:04:23,21 --> 00:04:25,59
Rolls with.

63
00:04:28,55 --> 00:04:33,56
Job. You know the difficult life.

64
00:04:34,99 --> 00:04:40,01
Yeah was pretty primitive language and
yes very primitive as lugging water

65
00:04:40,01 --> 00:04:42,19
and.

66
00:04:42,20 --> 00:04:46,79
Hosing down nappies learned then doing the
best you could do as far as shelter guys.

67
00:04:46,95 --> 00:04:49,76
Yeah i lived in a cow bales that had.

68
00:04:49,78 --> 00:04:55,66
No wall on one side the front of it
was just a garden and we had a hose

69
00:04:55,66 --> 00:04:59,00
and a baby's back a big
cuss don't have. Outside.

70
00:04:59,39 --> 00:05:03,13
No water in the actual
house and the woodstove

71
00:05:03,13 --> 00:05:07,76
that was totally unenclosed so at night
time in the winter was very cold and

72
00:05:08,85 --> 00:05:10,50
that was where my second child was born

73
00:05:10,50 --> 00:05:13,77
and we lived there for another couple of
years before we moved to another community

74
00:05:14,60 --> 00:05:20,86
and i was not impressed as a banshee i
think barely have to scription chuck

75
00:05:20,86 --> 00:05:23,57
wobblies regularly hurl
the plates to them.

76
00:05:23,57 --> 00:05:27,26
I didn't believe like this is not
what i was cut out for at all.

77
00:05:28,67 --> 00:05:33,28
How do children it wasn't as difficult
for me and i quite enjoyed that.

78
00:05:33,34 --> 00:05:38,35
I mean it was like just continuing the
playhouse best specter of my childhood

79
00:05:38,35 --> 00:05:45,01
and and being in north queensland
too are very different climate and.

80
00:05:46,30 --> 00:05:49,70
We still make these amazing
to call them plastic palaces.

81
00:05:50,32 --> 00:05:53,26
With a staple gun builders
plastic in the month.

82
00:05:53,77 --> 00:05:56,47
Trees along water's edge queensland.

83
00:05:56,58 --> 00:06:00,46
So it was different but when
we were here during. Festival.

84
00:06:00,64 --> 00:06:04,78
It was often very cold and the only
place you could bathe was in the creek

85
00:06:04,78 --> 00:06:11,13
and hence the bucket bands at the back
of the rainbow and things like that.

86
00:06:12,30 --> 00:06:15,03
Well tropical authors were a problem.

87
00:06:15,05 --> 00:06:18,83
A lot of people used to get really really
bad for the good old and basically

88
00:06:18,83 --> 00:06:21,90
that was because hygiene was
difficult and change of diet

89
00:06:22,66 --> 00:06:26,06
and change of lifestyle tends to bring
more of those things there and also

90
00:06:26,06 --> 00:06:28,92
that aspell and when it's seeds.

91
00:06:29,72 --> 00:06:30,26
I don't know why

92
00:06:30,26 --> 00:06:33,47
but you have to stick sister i think
you definitely get stuck to your skin

93
00:06:33,47 --> 00:06:34,81
and often if there was a little cut

94
00:06:34,81 --> 00:06:38,30
or grace there you'd end up with a
tropical ulcer and you would see

95
00:06:38,30 --> 00:06:40,99
and i think partly it was
diet as well. People may be.

96
00:06:41,44 --> 00:06:44,79
Going from being meted purely vegetarian

97
00:06:44,79 --> 00:06:47,52
and not getting the right
protein balance and you know

98
00:06:47,52 --> 00:06:50,78
and often not enough food
too little and good food.

99
00:06:52,08 --> 00:06:54,61
We didn't.

100
00:06:55,48 --> 00:07:02,30
Why one of my dear friends was pregnant at
the time and. We still sweet on her she.

101
00:07:02,36 --> 00:07:06,62
I think it was six weeks before the birth
just to get $25 a fortnight and so.

102
00:07:06,98 --> 00:07:09,50
And i was a smoker and
quite a heavy smoker

103
00:07:09,50 --> 00:07:12,90
and she used to buy me a
packet of drama out of

104
00:07:12,90 --> 00:07:17,52
that money every week every fortnight
if she could it wasn't every fortnight

105
00:07:17,52 --> 00:07:21,63
actually and we would
go to lismore to the u.

106
00:07:21,78 --> 00:07:24,82
P r u a the u.

107
00:07:24,82 --> 00:07:29,14
P a room which was like country
women's association food

108
00:07:29,94 --> 00:07:34,37
and we'd have corned beef and you know
with white sauce and boiled vegan

109
00:07:34,37 --> 00:07:37,15
and pudding and.

110
00:07:37,17 --> 00:07:42,44
If you have a real feel of raisin and
dissidents how will you know with a cloth

111
00:07:42,44 --> 00:07:49,34
and i always ask you did you know i
think that's a big treat. Yeah yeah.

112
00:07:49,36 --> 00:07:52,34
The single women around here that
was pensions were very popular

113
00:07:53,21 --> 00:07:57,22
and they would be a whole household centred
around this woman on a single pension.

114
00:07:57,49 --> 00:07:59,85
Yeah i feel we tell stories of that.

115
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,38
Now that thunderball right you
know they did use them because

116
00:08:03,38 --> 00:08:04,55
that you couldn't get social security

117
00:08:04,55 --> 00:08:09,04
but there was no you know the
single mothers would get it.

118
00:08:10,60 --> 00:08:13,33
Is.

119
00:08:15,30 --> 00:08:20,29
Broad was the only vd on
one queensland story.

120
00:08:20,63 --> 00:08:24,42
I think it was the force
community that i lived on.

121
00:08:24,44 --> 00:08:28,16
Living on a community well there's so
many different ways that it can be done.

122
00:08:28,33 --> 00:08:33,18
Roberts i would say one of the more
successful ones because the land was already

123
00:08:33,18 --> 00:08:38,68
owned by someone there was no necessity to
just take any comer to who had money to

124
00:08:38,68 --> 00:08:39,19
buy a share.

125
00:08:39,41 --> 00:08:45,19
So we managed to establish a very slowly
with extended family often brothers

126
00:08:45,19 --> 00:08:49,80
and sisters brothers and brothers mothers
and brothers children so incense

127
00:08:49,80 --> 00:08:55,81
and friends. Yeah you had to sort of you
have to be in really and it works because.

128
00:08:55,83 --> 00:08:56,37
We all

129
00:08:56,37 --> 00:09:01,80
but real strong heart communication between
the reporting it is rather like a big

130
00:09:01,80 --> 00:09:08,82
extended family you know which means.

131
00:09:08,83 --> 00:09:13,50
The non entrepreneurial
and the entrepreneurial.

132
00:09:13,52 --> 00:09:16,23
I mean places like which
is people that live it.

133
00:09:16,25 --> 00:09:18,67
Town of along my imagine
has its ups and downs.

134
00:09:18,77 --> 00:09:20,89
Because you don't get to
choose your neighbors

135
00:09:20,89 --> 00:09:22,66
but once again tangible very established

136
00:09:22,66 --> 00:09:25,53
and a lot of those people have known each
other for a really really long time.

137
00:09:25,87 --> 00:09:28,79
So there's a very strong
contingent of old friends.

138
00:09:30,01 --> 00:09:31,88
That i would say counterbalances.

139
00:09:32,57 --> 00:09:34,79
The adverse things that happen

140
00:09:34,79 --> 00:09:36,60
when you don't have any choice
about who you live with

141
00:09:36,60 --> 00:09:38,59
and i don't think westerns
are very good at that

142
00:09:38,59 --> 00:09:41,76
and i think we're very basic i think
we're commune all animals we're very

143
00:09:41,76 --> 00:09:42,21
territorial

144
00:09:43,02 --> 00:09:47,98
and so i don't really really feel though i
think feel economically communities work

145
00:09:47,98 --> 00:09:52,49
i don't think in the real sense.
People tend to isolate themselves and.

146
00:09:53,02 --> 00:09:59,84
A portion of this is mine and you know if
you stop on my vegie patch of. Bangla.

147
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,32
Those skills. Yeah but it's no natural
one for we know my son and i know

148
00:10:04,32 --> 00:10:06,73
that sort of training really if you think.

149
00:10:07,64 --> 00:10:10,07
And going you know your
occasionally is really good

150
00:10:11,84 --> 00:10:14,63
and communicate it come home
anything come but you switch

151
00:10:15,81 --> 00:10:18,11
and indians do it so much better yet.

152
00:10:18,28 --> 00:10:24,17
So much better human amount living
in close proximity with one another.

153
00:10:24,93 --> 00:10:28,29
Condition very much.

154
00:10:28,31 --> 00:10:33,55
Because a lot of the communities these days
are run in the sense of an equal share

155
00:10:33,55 --> 00:10:36,42
like i mean people even these
days have their own title

156
00:10:36,42 --> 00:10:40,29
and they have a portion of land that
is theirs that they can defend you

157
00:10:40,29 --> 00:10:45,09
and if they want to do so really they're
not all communities some of them are

158
00:10:45,09 --> 00:10:48,40
glorified subdivisions
though they're low cost.

159
00:10:48,86 --> 00:10:52,75
Rural accommodation for people
so in one sense they're vital.

160
00:10:52,92 --> 00:10:57,08
I mean i don't put them down at all though
i wouldn't choose to live like that.

161
00:10:58,32 --> 00:11:04,25
So for the foreseeable.

162
00:11:04,27 --> 00:11:07,97
It's come full circle out of
people's needs to be able to resell.

163
00:11:07,99 --> 00:11:12,90
You know can honestly come full circle
because it is difficult on our community we

164
00:11:12,90 --> 00:11:19,18
cannot sell our share and
we don't own a house

165
00:11:19,18 --> 00:11:25,73
and you know you know constitution.
It's the company that owns everything.

166
00:11:26,18 --> 00:11:29,18
And so we have that's us
too. So you know i mean.

167
00:11:29,28 --> 00:11:30,64
So we have to be sure

168
00:11:30,64 --> 00:11:33,13
that our relationships are very
good if you want to go somewhere.

169
00:11:33,49 --> 00:11:38,23
You don't go believing in a screaming
heap you actually leave fairly a legally

170
00:11:38,23 --> 00:11:40,73
and you have other things
that you have to do so.

171
00:11:42,26 --> 00:11:45,51
You do community organizers who
they want to live in your house and

172
00:11:45,51 --> 00:11:48,83
that person reimburses you but your
shares are totally non-refundable

173
00:11:48,83 --> 00:11:51,00
and that's the deal where
all of us agree to

174
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:53,87
that because their shares are
incredibly reasonably priced

175
00:11:53,87 --> 00:12:00,62
and there's only a small number
of them. Trust her. Much indeed.

176
00:12:00,79 --> 00:12:01,39
Yeah yeah

177
00:12:01,39 --> 00:12:05,74
but we built on trust because we didn't
have any tenure at all in the beginning

178
00:12:05,74 --> 00:12:07,86
when we built there and the woman

179
00:12:07,86 --> 00:12:11,12
that owned the land as one very
extraordinary human being.

180
00:12:11,39 --> 00:12:14,77
So we trusted her and she trusted
us and it's worked really well.

181
00:12:15,73 --> 00:12:18,07
But that's just like you
really do you feel like

182
00:12:18,07 --> 00:12:23,00
that.

183
00:12:24,56 --> 00:12:27,59
You. Do your my god.

184
00:12:29,59 --> 00:12:35,69
Mind got him you know. About
this one chasing other.

185
00:12:35,71 --> 00:12:38,84
We don't really need to discuss
the drug problem. Everybody else.

186
00:12:38,89 --> 00:12:41,65
You know about animals and we and that

187
00:12:41,65 --> 00:12:47,92
and it's sad changes the town is like
we've noticed in the last two years

188
00:12:47,92 --> 00:12:53,25
particularly that things are
going on here that is expanding.

189
00:12:53,38 --> 00:12:57,63
I mean to the point where we don't
have parking anymore in the street.

190
00:12:57,67 --> 00:13:01,49
It's a battle to even you know been.

191
00:13:02,26 --> 00:13:04,11
There's lots of new
businesses that have opened

192
00:13:04,11 --> 00:13:10,12
and they seem to be sustaining themselves.

193
00:13:10,14 --> 00:13:14,68
What. Well.

194
00:13:15,28 --> 00:13:19,48
We are accused of having become
more straight. I think and.

195
00:13:20,06 --> 00:13:22,21
Whatever that means i think

196
00:13:22,21 --> 00:13:28,40
that there are many more people
who were original accrues people

197
00:13:28,40 --> 00:13:30,04
that have decided to make a livelihood.

198
00:13:30,27 --> 00:13:31,51
But most of those people

199
00:13:31,51 --> 00:13:35,51
that i know make it out of something
they really enjoy doing so i don't know

200
00:13:35,51 --> 00:13:39,83
that i can see that as i said and also i
think their value system they've kept it.

201
00:13:39,88 --> 00:13:41,05
Yeah way back there.

202
00:13:41,13 --> 00:13:46,78
We did 10 throw a few
babies that we had to go

203
00:13:46,78 --> 00:13:50,73
and sort of start to shortly bring them
back and say sorry you were right.

204
00:13:50,79 --> 00:13:56,25
Mum and dad society sorry
we were a bit hazy

205
00:13:57,04 --> 00:13:59,26
but in the long term. No we did throw.

206
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,44
A lot of bathwater and it was
really good to get rid of.

207
00:14:03,33 --> 00:14:07,86
But we do have to survive you know we do
have to leave and we have to face that

208
00:14:07,86 --> 00:14:11,35
and you know. Look at society you think.

209
00:14:11,42 --> 00:14:13,02
Yes okay we'll try and feed him

210
00:14:13,02 --> 00:14:20,92
and as much on our terms
as possible for you know.

211
00:14:21,78 --> 00:14:26,71
Mom was a bit possibly the aquarian idea
so the beginning of the green movement.

212
00:14:27,14 --> 00:14:30,17
I think we need talked about the
necessity i don't really think yet for a

213
00:14:30,17 --> 00:14:34,88
revolution i truly believe that the
ecological movement is the revolution.

214
00:14:34,93 --> 00:14:37,78
I mean there was no way the society
was just going to collapse.

215
00:14:38,09 --> 00:14:43,35
But the an extraordinary amount of
waste that we produce as a race.

216
00:14:44,36 --> 00:14:46,81
If we didn't have the green movement
where the heck would we be.

217
00:14:47,02 --> 00:14:50,75
I mean they're like the watch it on even
though they taken 20 years for it to get

218
00:14:50,75 --> 00:14:53,44
gain any momentum at all for any training

219
00:14:53,44 --> 00:14:58,88
and years ago we were sitting down crying
about it then and and totally impotent

220
00:14:58,88 --> 00:15:01,35
and didn't know what
to do but could see it

221
00:15:01,35 --> 00:15:04,98
and people were talking about
it in real terms back then.

222
00:15:05,21 --> 00:15:10,32
If you had the years to hear it and nothing
was done and 20 years down the track.

223
00:15:10,87 --> 00:15:14,63
I mean that's why i sometimes catch
myself thinking it's too late and praying

224
00:15:14,63 --> 00:15:17,28
that it is and.

225
00:15:17,30 --> 00:15:22,58
I think it's really difficult but it
does seem to have a bit of a hold. Now.

226
00:15:23,01 --> 00:15:24,85
And it's moving ahead.

227
00:15:24,87 --> 00:15:29,34
And people are becoming conscious
of it and we've done it again.

228
00:15:29,69 --> 00:15:30,07
We've done

229
00:15:30,07 --> 00:15:33,89
that in the real funny way i've got a
friend who dresses up as an old lady

230
00:15:33,89 --> 00:15:38,08
and goes to supermarkets with born
to shop bags and badges you know.

231
00:15:38,40 --> 00:15:42,76
And she just advises everyone in the
supermarket what's best things via has a great

232
00:15:42,76 --> 00:15:47,90
time doing it goes off to all
the markets and i'm celeste.

233
00:15:47,92 --> 00:15:53,27
Less feel shop best but i think also

234
00:15:53,27 --> 00:15:57,42
that forest protesters protests that we
had around him an area where they were

235
00:15:57,42 --> 00:15:59,38
that all markets and for a lot of.

236
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,09
A subsequent movements

237
00:16:02,09 --> 00:16:07,75
and at the time there was the biggest uproar
about the hippies telling the loggers

238
00:16:07,75 --> 00:16:10,26
what to do. I mean we
worked the confrontations

239
00:16:10,26 --> 00:16:14,07
that some of those the terrain in one
in particular i remember was horrible.

240
00:16:14,10 --> 00:16:18,45
I mean you know people being
hauled off trees and it was not

241
00:16:18,46 --> 00:16:20,47
that really broke new
ground and really dead

242
00:16:20,47 --> 00:16:24,30
and it has made a very big it's made people
more courageous about speaking up for

243
00:16:24,30 --> 00:16:26,75
what they believe in and chaining
themselves to trees if they feel

244
00:16:26,75 --> 00:16:31,70
that that's necessary. So i do believe that
the aquarius movement yes there chris.

245
00:16:31,78 --> 00:16:33,47
Estival but that whole period in time.

246
00:16:35,34 --> 00:16:36,06
Was the beginning of

247
00:16:36,06 --> 00:16:43,56
that of any real change as far as they go.

248
00:16:45,39 --> 00:16:52,22
But if you go to. You know i'm a little
bit. I think a result of a funny one.

249
00:16:52,38 --> 00:16:58,53
Okay i'll tell you about being in
jail like being in jail part of

250
00:16:59,51 --> 00:17:05,55
it but it was it was fun.
I shouldn't say you know.

251
00:17:06,35 --> 00:17:08,54
We had this old car.

252
00:17:08,87 --> 00:17:14,35
Carter going to have to tell all these
awful things we have this old car an old

253
00:17:14,35 --> 00:17:18,55
holden called louis good
australian name that jim

254
00:17:18,55 --> 00:17:22,44
and i had bought from a friend of ours
called robbie in sydney was supposed to pay

255
00:17:22,44 --> 00:17:24,57
my hundred dollars. We paid him 20.

256
00:17:25,33 --> 00:17:28,66
Neither of us had a licence and
we left sydney at about 2 a.m.

257
00:17:28,66 --> 00:17:33,12
So we wouldn't have any traffic both time
we got to hornsby is it already lost

258
00:17:33,12 --> 00:17:36,19
second gear. So we went up

259
00:17:36,19 --> 00:17:41,33
and we arrived at my parents place on
route to him and were coming to him

260
00:17:41,33 --> 00:17:44,35
and to work the festival and.

261
00:17:44,36 --> 00:17:48,68
Evaded all the questions about the
legalities of this piece that we had

262
00:17:48,68 --> 00:17:52,39
and then we came up here.

263
00:17:52,41 --> 00:17:58,74
And we were at the story is about driving
down to the beach down past byron bay

264
00:17:58,74 --> 00:17:59,86
with a call for a broken.

265
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,14
Had when we went down there was a caravan
park there anyway so we parked louis.

266
00:18:04,32 --> 00:18:08,82
G there and we went down to the
beach and the tide came in.

267
00:18:09,01 --> 00:18:13,63
So we were able to swim around a couple
of beaches away from the caravan park

268
00:18:14,42 --> 00:18:17,81
and as we come out of north queensland
we've been running naked for a couple of

269
00:18:17,81 --> 00:18:21,10
years already. Off went the clothes
and then we went for a good swim.

270
00:18:21,36 --> 00:18:22,62
And i must tell you.

271
00:18:22,73 --> 00:18:27,10
Jill was nearly nine months pregnant with
tinking at this point in time so she was

272
00:18:27,96 --> 00:18:33,01
very big and round and round things you
know breasts is renowned for its teeth

273
00:18:33,75 --> 00:18:39,98
and to blue eyes in case this guy
goes to defocus for that pub.

274
00:18:39,98 --> 00:18:44,22
Beautiful blue but i feel it anyway.

275
00:18:44,23 --> 00:18:47,13
So we'd have a swim in july and
i was sitting on the beach

276
00:18:47,13 --> 00:18:49,42
and we could see a guy i
don't know he was stupid.

277
00:18:49,64 --> 00:18:53,51
I mean something to remember or fishing
and and he waved as he went past

278
00:18:53,51 --> 00:18:56,52
and he climbed up was like
go trail over the mountain

279
00:18:56,52 --> 00:19:00,71
and back around the caravan park
and there was nobody you know

280
00:19:00,71 --> 00:19:05,17
and until we looked up and
here are two policemen.

281
00:19:05,49 --> 00:19:08,56
Well two men police and
coming down over the hill.

282
00:19:09,29 --> 00:19:13,11
So we sort of had a little discussion
about what to do so i will just stay put.

283
00:19:13,39 --> 00:19:17,54
It's okay you know i mean surely they could
handle we're sitting down you know it's

284
00:19:17,54 --> 00:19:22,26
not much to see and and jules
we've seen how you swim and.

285
00:19:22,76 --> 00:19:24,63
These men walk right up to us

286
00:19:24,63 --> 00:19:29,07
and we sort of that's really insensitive
you know now what. And they said.

287
00:19:30,42 --> 00:19:33,49
Where police get your
clothes on girlie you know.

288
00:19:33,50 --> 00:19:38,59
And they were saying to jules come out
of the water come out of the water

289
00:19:38,59 --> 00:19:43,98
and she's saying you know
what was going on. You know.

290
00:19:44,11 --> 00:19:48,61
Anyway so jill stood up
to sort of get a close on

291
00:19:48,61 --> 00:19:53,00
and they just looked at the figure you
know until then they were just looking at

292
00:19:53,00 --> 00:19:54,32
these don't come on girlie you know.

293
00:19:54,37 --> 00:19:57,75
Get your clothes and you see the
uk pregnant and she said you.

294
00:20:01,30 --> 00:20:05,16
How do you think watermelon will
be really cheeky to them you know

295
00:20:05,16 --> 00:20:09,07
but it was just seemed the most ludicrous
thing which was of course i mean

296
00:20:09,07 --> 00:20:12,29
apparently the fisherman had
told the guy at the caravan park

297
00:20:12,29 --> 00:20:16,28
and the guy at the caravan park hated
hippies so he rang the police thinking this

298
00:20:16,28 --> 00:20:18,38
is a good. You know this is a good one.

299
00:20:18,48 --> 00:20:22,31
And so they had to walk
like i know kilometre

300
00:20:22,31 --> 00:20:24,49
or something over this
track to get to us anyway.

301
00:20:26,11 --> 00:20:29,22
So anyway by this time jules's
realised that something's going on.

302
00:20:29,47 --> 00:20:32,76
So i called and said come
and get you close on.

303
00:20:34,02 --> 00:20:36,40
So we did you know sort of a fashion

304
00:20:36,40 --> 00:20:41,05
and we had to follow them one walked in
front and walked behind and off we went

305
00:20:42,27 --> 00:20:47,08
and. Trying to communicate with
each other because we didn't want.

306
00:20:47,31 --> 00:20:48,98
I didn't want to knowledge

307
00:20:48,98 --> 00:20:53,31
that we had this bloody car because
none of us had that's right

308
00:20:53,31 --> 00:20:57,80
and there's a little bit of something or
other in the glove box plus all our names.

309
00:20:57,88 --> 00:20:58,94
You know letters

310
00:20:58,94 --> 00:21:03,20
and you know just all our stuff our
whole life was in bloody leading pussy.

311
00:21:04,18 --> 00:21:05,08
So i wasn't drunk.

312
00:21:06,20 --> 00:21:10,37
A car you know so as we went past we just
go over my little wave and we went on

313
00:21:10,37 --> 00:21:13,51
and so they put us in the
police can't talk association

314
00:21:13,51 --> 00:21:18,84
and they actually had to ring up to find
out what to charge us with so they went

315
00:21:18,84 --> 00:21:24,00
for the criminal charge which was offensive
behaviour and will fingerprinted

316
00:21:24,71 --> 00:21:30,21
and searched and they had to
search our belongings and.

317
00:21:30,23 --> 00:21:33,69
I had a certain belonging that
really they didn't like looking at

318
00:21:33,69 --> 00:21:40,37
and i told them i wouldn't they had no
woman there so you know one of the police

319
00:21:40,37 --> 00:21:42,38
and had to go the toilet.
I mean it was just crazy.

320
00:21:42,71 --> 00:21:45,99
They could have just said you know you
know we're not going to answer this call.

321
00:21:46,16 --> 00:21:49,41
But they obviously wanted to make
a stand and it was something

322
00:21:49,41 --> 00:21:56,03
that people were being offended by at
that point in time with the people with

323
00:21:56,03 --> 00:21:59,89
that close on no matter how far away.
You went from everybody. It was just.

324
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,68
An issue. So we got locked up but.

325
00:22:03,70 --> 00:22:08,92
We told them that jill would be very
upset if she was locked in a cell

326
00:22:08,92 --> 00:22:10,36
and might bring on her birth.

327
00:22:10,46 --> 00:22:15,16
So i didn't even dare and they locked
us up to date in the exercise yard.

328
00:22:15,18 --> 00:22:18,55
So when glazier singing
not gone like forms of.

329
00:22:18,91 --> 00:22:22,74
Honey you know it was that was
really you know learn that song

330
00:22:22,74 --> 00:22:25,82
and they brought us some fish and
chips because we were vegetarians

331
00:22:26,73 --> 00:22:33,31
and wholemeal bread and huge mustard.
And by then we rang gray and.

332
00:22:34,03 --> 00:22:37,90
You clarice foundation by
water so they let us out.

333
00:22:38,10 --> 00:22:41,84
And meanwhile i can't still around the
beach and still didn't have a baby.

334
00:22:41,99 --> 00:22:43,83
Thank god.

335

That we had to go to court

336
00:22:46,53 --> 00:22:51,73
and the whole of nimbin turned up at the
court which of course didn't do any good

337
00:22:51,73 --> 00:22:55,83

00:23:03,75 --> 00:23:07,86

on the footpath under a rock sign.

It was a funny time. Very interesting.

345
00:23:31,23 --> 00:23:34,06
He said oh yes we were guilty

346
00:23:36,70 --> 00:23:40,39
but oh yes.

347
00:23:45,09 --> 00:23:49,73
Yes we were all fined $50 or 10 days
and nobody was going to do 10 days.

348
00:23:49,93 --> 00:23:56,67
So we were promised we would
give them 50 dollars. A.
