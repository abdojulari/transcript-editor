00:01:12,19 --> 00:01:18,62
engineers on the bridge and there were
various other ones. There's a mr.

18
00:01:18,62 --> 00:01:21,28
Ferguson he was in charge
of the crimes crane

19
00:01:21,28 --> 00:01:25,06
a wreck should anybody think. Do you remember
them. Do you remember anything about

20
00:01:25,06 --> 00:01:30,29
them especially. Well. Two
of them. Mr. Muir and mr.

21
00:01:30,29 --> 00:01:35,90
Ferguson the scotchman and. The other
chap was an englishman and that they had

22
00:01:35,90 --> 00:01:41,21
a lot of english and scotch on the job
there. They predominated really the

23
00:01:41,21 --> 00:01:47,59
engineers engineers and workmen as well.
What did you do next after being an office

24
00:01:47,59 --> 00:01:54,07
boy. Well i was there till about
nineteen started nineteen twenty eight.

25
00:01:54,19 --> 00:01:58,41
And then i left there and
served my apprenticeship as

26
00:01:58,42 --> 00:02:05,14
a plumber in the city and things got very
bad in 1931 about this middle of 1931 and

27
00:02:05,14 --> 00:02:10,86
my father who was still the working there.
Got me back on the bridge and they were

28
00:02:10,86 --> 00:02:15,40
putting their hand rails across then
the pipe handrails and he got me in

29
00:02:15,40 --> 00:02:19,70
a gang of plumbers there. There were ten
of us working there and we worked on the

30
00:02:19,70 --> 00:02:26,14
pipe railings or the top arch and the
lower arch and i was there till about

31
00:02:27,19 --> 00:02:33,68
. After the opening and after that i worked.
Cleaning down the power long and we

32
00:02:33,68 --> 00:02:38,36
had to clean them down scrape them down and
with air hoses and water wash them down

33
00:02:38,36 --> 00:02:42,13
. We did that with the stagings the you
know for the riggers put the stagings up.

34
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:46,89
Do you remember when you were doing the
plumbing handrails up the top with

35
00:02:46,89 --> 00:02:53,37
a curved. Not as far as i know
they went from dawn to staunton

36
00:02:53,37 --> 00:02:57,99
and they were just three quarter black pipe
they were i think they were steam pipe

37
00:02:57,99 --> 00:03:02,31
and they were just greed and weep and they
weren't actually curvy just went from

38
00:03:02,31 --> 00:03:05,09
staunch into two stores is there

39
00:03:05,09 --> 00:03:08,07
a number of people who told me that
everything on the bridge was straight and i

40
00:03:08,07 --> 00:03:11,74
just want to wear that we've got something
that was curved. They weren't there only

41
00:03:12,57 --> 00:03:14,96
about every i think every
ten feet there was

42
00:03:14,96 --> 00:03:19,69
a staunch and so they with the great curvature
of the arch they didn't really need

43
00:03:19,69 --> 00:03:26,15
that for the pipes you know the handrails.
Was it hard work was fairly hard work.

44
00:03:26,19 --> 00:03:29,46
It was very windy out there and you had
to watch yourself and they unease dab

45
00:03:29,46 --> 00:03:31,14
a little rope lifelines

46
00:03:31,14 --> 00:03:35,99
a used to love me. Call them and they had
to be very careful on wet days we won't

47
00:03:35,99 --> 00:03:40,97
allow we didn't work. We came the. Because
of the slippery conditions you get paid

48
00:03:40,97 --> 00:03:45,34
for that. Yes i was very well paid. There
we got height money starting from the

49
00:03:45,34 --> 00:03:50,19
deck. Upwards i got about £8 ten a
week and then on the arch of the £10

50
00:03:51,15 --> 00:03:55,26
a week which was very good money in those
days about double wages. The only thing

51
00:03:55,26 --> 00:03:56,70
jack lalanne used to take a shilling

52
00:03:56,70 --> 00:04:01,81
a week out of it. The taxi just came in and
we thought that was terrible. With the

53
00:04:01,81 --> 00:04:07,22
unemployment tax unemployment tax yet to
pay the people it was unemployed. Yes. To

54
00:04:07,22 --> 00:04:13,23
help. That's what i when i asked you whether
you've got paid. I mean this although

55
00:04:13,23 --> 00:04:13,69
you answered

56
00:04:13,69 --> 00:04:17,91
a number of things there. Good i wanted
to know that but did you get paid for wet

57
00:04:17,91 --> 00:04:22,91
weather. No i don't think so no we didn't
get paid. You only got paid for when you

58
00:04:22,91 --> 00:04:28,91
worked. No holiday. No holiday pay or
anything like that. No super no sick pay

59
00:04:30,96 --> 00:04:34,59
. You remember the anything else about
working up on the ice the conditions up

60
00:04:34,59 --> 00:04:40,95
there. Anything stick in
your mind. Well one day i

61
00:04:40,95 --> 00:04:46,01
slipped really through the staunching and
that and i only just held on by one hand

62
00:04:46,01 --> 00:04:49,65
and i got missiles up and i often just
after that i wondered whether the job was

63
00:04:49,65 --> 00:04:53,53
worth it. You know take me alive
but that was risky you know

64
00:04:53,53 --> 00:04:57,69
a bit and that. But that was all you know.
Do you member any other accidents while

65
00:04:57,69 --> 00:05:00,47
you were there. Yes i was there was

66
00:05:00,47 --> 00:05:05,31
a chap named jimmy campbell the last man
to get killed in the bridge and just after

67
00:05:05,31 --> 00:05:09,32
we finished the handrails on the arch we
worked in the pilings on the rails and

68
00:05:09,32 --> 00:05:09,49
there's

69
00:05:09,49 --> 00:05:15,71
a plumber and i working there. One morning
and jimmy campbell of the foreman rigger

70
00:05:15,71 --> 00:05:19,73
came up he was putting the stagings deal
with these men and he came up and he

71
00:05:19,73 --> 00:05:24,01
walked up very slow and. I knew him
very well my father that he was

72
00:05:24,01 --> 00:05:28,13
a friend of my father's as well and i said
you very seem to be very tired and i'm

73
00:05:28,13 --> 00:05:34,00
a very glad when this job's over to you now
he said and he walked up and. Now half

74
00:05:34,00 --> 00:05:37,53
an hour later these men come down and said
he's gone over. He got caught. There was

75
00:05:37,53 --> 00:05:38,78
a needle there what they put up

76
00:05:38,78 --> 00:05:43,80
a wooden needle where they put the
stagings down and he got caught in and

77
00:05:43,80 --> 00:05:49,43
catapulted over onto the top and he went
down through the railway lines and i was

78
00:05:49,43 --> 00:05:53,32
talking to electrician after it working
and the lights just above. They were

79
00:05:53,32 --> 00:05:57,02
putting the lights there then and the jimmy
missed him by about two or three feet

80
00:05:57,02 --> 00:06:01,11
he said he would have gone to. But when
you look at the railway lines you want to

81
00:06:01,11 --> 00:06:04,98
how body got through but he got through it.
Anyone right at the bottom of the into

82
00:06:04,98 --> 00:06:10,51
the pile on there that was on doors side
and we had the afternoon off in respect

83
00:06:12,11 --> 00:06:16,41
to some of us do you have any amusing
things other than the the more tragic ones.

84
00:06:17,96 --> 00:06:18,94
Well i used to have

85
00:06:18,94 --> 00:06:24,93
a lot to jobs the jokes there about the
things and that the you know so many things

86
00:06:24,93 --> 00:06:28,53
used to fall into the harbour from
underneath specially rules if you're set on

87
00:06:28,53 --> 00:06:33,56
a girder the your ruler go down and i must
as thought about ten rules while i was

88
00:06:33,56 --> 00:06:38,41
there and he was peter to get it and things
used to go down underneath and some of

89
00:06:38,41 --> 00:06:41,75
the chaps reckoned that if it weren't for
another seven years they wouldn't need

90
00:06:42,63 --> 00:06:47,21
a bridge they can walk over with a bit
of concrete on the top you know scrap as

91
00:06:47,21 --> 00:06:50,41
a roadway. Lots of things. Well

92
00:06:50,41 --> 00:06:56,02
a few. Many other amusing things you can
remember. Well as another thing that died

93
00:06:56,02 --> 00:07:00,19
i know whether it was only me that used
to see it really i think sometimes it is

94
00:07:00,19 --> 00:07:04,25
just sad but when of us first
going over there to go down there

95
00:07:04,25 --> 00:07:08,57
a lot on the sats because i was always
interested me father was interested in

96
00:07:08,57 --> 00:07:14,87
showing me that and when they were
getting the steelworkers to meet. Doors.

97
00:07:15,24 --> 00:07:19,96
I think it was the curve on the and north
shore side but it used to look at depot

98
00:07:19,96 --> 00:07:25,46
like. They weren't going to meet at all
and some used to say that we'd finish up

99
00:07:25,46 --> 00:07:27,32
with two bridges you know enough to build

100
00:07:27,32 --> 00:07:30,94
a piling in and eat another piling
each side because i certainly

101
00:07:30,94 --> 00:07:37,46
a joke of course that was there when the
public works were approaches were coming

102
00:07:37,46 --> 00:07:44,35
around to meet the north shire.
So yes i think the public works

103
00:07:44,35 --> 00:07:49,36
built up to about george street north on
the sydney side and the doormen long as i

104
00:07:49,36 --> 00:07:54,71
went up to there with their work and
that. Who only you were as an office boy

105
00:07:54,71 --> 00:08:00,24
timekeeping do you remember how many people
were working there then. Well you mean

106
00:08:00,24 --> 00:08:01,82
counting down the camera you two there was

107
00:08:01,82 --> 00:08:08,71
a you know. Twenty seven twenty
and twenty eight and all that i

108
00:08:08,72 --> 00:08:11,12
don't really know but
there'd be a there was

109
00:08:11,12 --> 00:08:15,44
a fair crowd there would be about seven
or eight hundred people i should think

110
00:08:17,13 --> 00:08:22,72
about right. But the one of the number of
meru you may show they were star masons.

111
00:08:22,87 --> 00:08:24,69
Do you have any do you get out of

112
00:08:24,69 --> 00:08:29,57
a are you at all in later years i did
because my father told me where it was and

113
00:08:29,57 --> 00:08:34,29
that and that he was in charge of checking
the granite. On the wharf when it came

114
00:08:34,29 --> 00:08:38,06
to sydney that was part of his job to check
the ground the sizes and everything.

115
00:08:38,23 --> 00:08:43,81
And doors point but in later years i went
used to go down there and i'm going to to

116
00:08:43,81 --> 00:08:49,45
melbourne and adelaide and camp there
sometimes in the. The old quarry there. What

117
00:08:49,45 --> 00:08:53,80
happened to you after you got laid off
from the bridge. What did you get work or

118
00:08:53,80 --> 00:08:57,93
were you on the dole. Now actually
wasn't on the dole. But we had

119
00:08:57,93 --> 00:09:01,34
a little bit of money. My brother
and i and that and we had

120
00:09:01,34 --> 00:09:03,73
a little farm up on the
hawkesbury river at

121
00:09:03,73 --> 00:09:10,32
a place called our portland and i was
there for four years from 1932 to 1936 we

122
00:09:10,32 --> 00:09:15,41
just saw the depression out there and then
what do you do then. Well then my father

123
00:09:15,41 --> 00:09:19,19
who is a. Also a builder
and that and i was

124
00:09:19,19 --> 00:09:21,16
a plumber and the other
my other brother was

125
00:09:21,16 --> 00:09:26,22
a painter we used to build it or cottages
fibro cottages and we did that up to the

126
00:09:26,22 --> 00:09:31,90
time of the war starting. So i'd like some
of the others. You didn't ever get on

127
00:09:31,90 --> 00:09:36,81
the dole. Now i was actually on relief work
up in the hospital for two years worked

128
00:09:36,81 --> 00:09:42,47
on the road around the hawkesbury there
for two years we used to get twenty four

129
00:09:42,47 --> 00:09:45,70
shillings for about two days work and

130
00:09:45,70 --> 00:09:50,19
a. I used to have to walk ten miles every
second friday at wiseman's ferry to

131
00:09:50,19 --> 00:09:54,14
collect that money which was about twenty
four shillings i think but i would have

132
00:09:54,14 --> 00:10:00,76
was was absent all buttons were yes and
orman's was the other side of. Wisemans

133
00:10:00,76 --> 00:10:05,91
ferry but we worked on the sydney side. We
worked from lower portland till wisemans

134
00:10:05,91 --> 00:10:12,44
fairly on the road the right. Do you
remember the working conditions

135
00:10:12,44 --> 00:10:19,18
on the bridge. What they were like to rember
any union activity are used to be some

136
00:10:19,18 --> 00:10:24,42
not in our section much but they often
used to go on strike there. And the steel

137
00:10:24,42 --> 00:10:28,62
workers and that and what they used to
do sometimes they just walk off and they

138
00:10:28,62 --> 00:10:33,00
wouldn't tell the boss and the boss would
have to find out why they're gone. That

139
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:33,34
used to be

140
00:10:33,34 --> 00:10:37,72
a common thing. It was nothing like these
days but in their way they used to go on

141
00:10:37,72 --> 00:10:37,90
strike

142
00:10:37,90 --> 00:10:43,75
a bit you know for the conditions. Do you
remember anything any union activity at

143
00:10:43,75 --> 00:10:47,69
all the unions. Where you had to be

144
00:10:47,69 --> 00:10:52,95
a union member to be on there. That's the
only thing and that but i didn't have

145
00:10:52,95 --> 00:10:54,42
much to do with the union. I was just

146
00:10:54,42 --> 00:11:01,29
a union member and that was all. Well.
While you were working as an office boy

147
00:11:01,29 --> 00:11:06,49
in the early days. Is there anything
particularly stands out in your mind here sort

148
00:11:06,49 --> 00:11:11,45
of one's very vivid thing. One night
just before knocking off time about

149
00:11:11,45 --> 00:11:16,17
a quarter fire we used to knock off at
five o'clock. At the time he had gone down

150
00:11:16,17 --> 00:11:16,92
the it was

151
00:11:16,92 --> 00:11:23,100
a ship going to america i
think it's gone down down in

152
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,46
the harbor and a little while later
someone said it was a fairy and it was

153
00:11:28,46 --> 00:11:30,100
a great cliff and. I remember them

154
00:11:31,99 --> 00:11:36,07
a great activity there and the next week
was very bad because if they were looking

155
00:11:36,07 --> 00:11:41,46
at all. The. All the bodies of these poor
little schoolgirls that got to ground

156
00:11:41,46 --> 00:11:41,98
there. It was

157
00:11:41,98 --> 00:11:47,42
a very gloomy week that week. The next
week and i mean member that very vividly

158
00:11:48,79 --> 00:11:55,78
remember anything else and
that time. Oh yes. Another

159
00:11:55,78 --> 00:11:59,02
thing i remember was my father. This was

160
00:11:59,02 --> 00:12:03,36
a saturday. He took one they were demolishing
at the back of the bridge. You know

161
00:12:03,36 --> 00:12:06,17
at sydney's side. He took me down

162
00:12:06,17 --> 00:12:10,59
a street. That's defunct now that's not
their name printed street princes street

163
00:12:11,45 --> 00:12:18,13
and goes back to wynyard there. It was
and he said this of history said this is

164
00:12:18,13 --> 00:12:18,52
that it was

165
00:12:18,52 --> 00:12:23,95
a terrible street. Prostitute and everything
the sailors and in the old days. He

166
00:12:23,95 --> 00:12:27,56
said and you couldn't walk down this street
in the night time he said it was such

167
00:12:27,56 --> 00:12:33,08
a dreadful street. And he said now it's
getting demolished he sent for. The bridge

168
00:12:33,08 --> 00:12:39,58
and that is where the bridge goes back to
wynyard the hand that stuck very vividly

169
00:12:39,58 --> 00:12:46,10
in the memory. Where did you live at
that time i lived there west ride and

170
00:12:46,87 --> 00:12:53,45

Yes. And oh yes of course you were the
