1
00:00:17,22 --> 00:00:19,40
Yes. And and we learnt quickly

2
00:00:19,40 --> 00:00:25,70
and it was also important for us to
have times to be together as women.

3
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:30,75
For instance i'm part of a women's support
group which has been going for seven

4
00:00:30,75 --> 00:00:34,30
years and it's been put important
for us to get together

5
00:00:34,30 --> 00:00:37,78
and to talk about our own experiences
and to reflect and to really encourage

6
00:00:37,78 --> 00:00:44,72
and challenge each other to take
steps and be brave and despair gap.

7
00:00:44,74 --> 00:00:48,38
And it's been important for
the men also to get together

8
00:00:48,38 --> 00:00:54,66
and to explore what have to be in the
limitations of growing up in the society on

9
00:00:54,66 --> 00:01:00,58
them as men and what did they need to
do to open up their other aspects.

10
00:01:01,37 --> 00:01:03,28
So at times we worked separately

11
00:01:04,24 --> 00:01:08,70
and then came back together much
stronger both much stronger

12
00:01:09,53 --> 00:01:12,69
and were able to face each other
and times work on forgiveness.

13
00:01:14,21 --> 00:01:21,14
Yeah that was important. Problems working.

14
00:01:22,68 --> 00:01:25,72
It's not a problem with people
who accept the necessity for it.

15
00:01:25,81 --> 00:01:30,67
I mean this times when when it might
have been perceived as a threat.

16
00:01:31,72 --> 00:01:34,98
But it's it seems a lot more can
happen by working together.

17
00:01:35,37 --> 00:01:40,66
Initially separately and then coming
back together and meeting is as equals.

18
00:01:42,22 --> 00:01:45,64
Rather than sort of hammering
it out on an individual basis.

19
00:01:46,27 --> 00:01:52,41
Somehow that's a slower path here so
the women's movement has been a really

20
00:01:52,41 --> 00:01:53,56
important strand.

21
00:01:53,73 --> 00:01:59,95
I think in the growing and changing
and bringing aquarius to through it.

22
00:02:00,29 --> 00:02:14,33
Yes.

23
00:02:17,82 --> 00:02:24,79
I am in the area is seeing. Yeah.

24
00:02:24,81 --> 00:02:28,95
Alan andresen.

25
00:02:30,72 --> 00:02:33,49
The deferred.

26
00:02:33,51 --> 00:02:39,79
But very much part of the the aquarius
generation i suppose i was a radical young

27
00:02:39,79 --> 00:02:43,62
senior tutor in psychology in the
car uni at the time of the festival

28
00:02:43,62 --> 00:02:45,46
and it was all

29
00:02:45,46 --> 00:02:49,84
that stuff was in the air about about leaving
the cities about making our own world

30
00:02:49,84 --> 00:02:53,64
instead of the one that was producing the
vietnam war and the oil crisis and the

31
00:02:54,73 --> 00:03:01,38
and what we thought was the you know
just the the decline in the whole

32
00:03:01,38 --> 00:03:04,29
quality of life and the absence
of any kind of spiritual

33
00:03:04,29 --> 00:03:10,29
or magic dimension in life in the
lives of our parents i suppose. And.

34
00:03:11,27 --> 00:03:13,85
After the queries. First of
all that it became obvious

35
00:03:13,85 --> 00:03:18,28
that some people were actually leaving the
cities leaving the universities going up

36
00:03:18,28 --> 00:03:22,53
to leave in the way that we were
all starting to talk about.

37
00:03:22,55 --> 00:03:26,49
And the beginning of 1975 and.

38
00:03:27,50 --> 00:03:32,59
I already knew some some friends who are
already come up to to live in a minute

39
00:03:32,59 --> 00:03:38,74
left their jobs and so i got to be
friends got to be part of a group.

40
00:03:39,49 --> 00:03:44,75
Who were interested in buying
a huge area of land and.

41
00:03:45,36 --> 00:03:49,58
A little bit west of nimbin where we
could have a virtually self-sufficient.

42
00:03:51,99 --> 00:03:55,19
Place almost a self-sufficient town

43
00:03:56,11 --> 00:04:01,61
and eventually about 25
shareholders 25. Groups.

44
00:04:01,63 --> 00:04:04,35
Some a couple summer single people.

45
00:04:04,36 --> 00:04:09,44
Both 65000 acres of land out on the head
of the clarence river a couple of hours

46
00:04:09,44 --> 00:04:15,93
west of newman. Yeah carol when you was.

47
00:04:17,16 --> 00:04:19,44
It's really a wilderness it's
the headwaters of the clarence

48
00:04:19,44 --> 00:04:20,58
and the cataract rivers.

49
00:04:20,65 --> 00:04:25,76
So it's completely mountainous with some
tiny little bits of flatland perfectly

50
00:04:25,77 --> 00:04:30,83
suited to to a commune for lots of people
to live on because it's magic country.

51
00:04:31,01 --> 00:04:36,75
It's miles of literally mars of these rivers
because they snake around all the all

52
00:04:36,76 --> 00:04:42,08
the mountains and magic mushrooms
grew there in profusion. And.

53
00:04:42,38 --> 00:04:43,92
You couldn't farm it very much.

54
00:04:44,06 --> 00:04:50,13
So it looked like a lot of hard work and
it was just really interesting country.

55
00:04:50,66 --> 00:04:52,37
It was.

56
00:04:53,12 --> 00:04:59,95
Not hundreds of miles away but only any
sort of 70 kilometres away from the coast.

57
00:05:00,89 --> 00:05:05,46
And we thought that. What we do is go and
move up there and have a be able to.

58
00:05:06,84 --> 00:05:10,60
To make a truly self-sufficient sort of
lifestyle with some of the high tech new

59
00:05:10,60 --> 00:05:11,75
age.

60
00:05:11,77 --> 00:05:14,29
Things like fish farming
in organic agriculture

61
00:05:14,29 --> 00:05:18,30
that were being studied
in the in the new age.

62
00:05:18,32 --> 00:05:23,68
Institutions in america.

63
00:05:25,13 --> 00:05:26,78
We were at a mixed group.

64
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:30,92
Basically the group started with a group
called design farm from western australia

65
00:05:32,28 --> 00:05:36,91
which was a core group of a couple of
architects in a couple of engineers who

66
00:05:37,82 --> 00:05:40,28
tended for did to build

67
00:05:40,28 --> 00:05:44,60
and design how mining towns in western
australia including putting in the water

68
00:05:44,60 --> 00:05:49,87
supply and the electricity supply
power supply and roads and all

69
00:05:49,87 --> 00:05:50,45
that sort of thing

70
00:05:50,45 --> 00:05:57,24
and they found they work out to a lot of
kind of people who would like to work for

71
00:05:57,24 --> 00:05:59,57
six or nine months intensively
but weren't 9 to 5.

72
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,19
So the people so that was a group
got together together with them.

73
00:06:06,43 --> 00:06:07,46
They were from western australia

74
00:06:07,46 --> 00:06:12,72
and the other half of the group came
from sydney where i'm expansive.

75
00:06:12,74 --> 00:06:15,50
I was an academic there
were some musicians.

76
00:06:16,67 --> 00:06:21,69
But just generally people who are interested
in creating our own lifestyle as a

77
00:06:21,69 --> 00:06:24,93
person and you know living the way

78
00:06:24,93 --> 00:06:28,64
that we were we were thinking challenging
the existing ideas of family

79
00:06:28,64 --> 00:06:31,01
and economy

80
00:06:31,02 --> 00:06:36,35
and the whole business of having an older
generation who were conscripting us to go

81
00:06:36,35 --> 00:06:40,40
to war was we didn't believe in against.

82
00:06:41,20 --> 00:06:44,51
You know the threat of so-called threat
of communism when we are self taught

83
00:06:44,51 --> 00:06:47,87
that we need a lot more communality
in our lives and a lot more sharing

84
00:06:47,87 --> 00:06:51,93
and a lot less and just
working to increase money

85
00:06:51,93 --> 00:06:56,74
and we already had plenty. And i remember.

86
00:06:56,76 --> 00:07:01,87
Just before we we came up to
see for we left the city.

87
00:07:01,89 --> 00:07:03,81
We had a draft dodgers.

88
00:07:05,35 --> 00:07:06,57
Sort of organization going

89
00:07:06,57 --> 00:07:09,76
that we had hired people who'd already
been conscripted in the lottery.

90
00:07:11,87 --> 00:07:15,09
And we brought you have to think as a russian
poet out to speak at new south wales

91
00:07:15,09 --> 00:07:18,64
university which was a real.

92
00:07:19,87 --> 00:07:24,23
Really flying in the face of a government
who was saying the conscripting us to to

93
00:07:24,23 --> 00:07:25,94
fight. You know

94
00:07:25,94 --> 00:07:38,85
that the communist system in
in latin south east asia.

95
00:07:40,61 --> 00:07:43,18
Was based on all the new age principles.

96
00:07:43,31 --> 00:07:49,15
You know ideas from living community and
nonviolently as the american indians did.

97
00:07:49,17 --> 00:07:52,97
Ideas from the eastern religions
which we're starting to.

98
00:07:53,86 --> 00:07:59,93
To embrace into. And the stand
and follow at that time. Lot of.

99
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,48
Ideas about having magic as well as the
spiritual dimension their lives from from

100
00:08:05,49 --> 00:08:11,27
psychoactive psychedelic
drugs. But very much. I think.

101
00:08:12,66 --> 00:08:14,13
Very much. It was just an adventure.

102
00:08:14,41 --> 00:08:20,31
Very much life in the city was was quite
comfortable the country was wealthy.

103
00:08:20,33 --> 00:08:23,29
It was easy to get scholarships
to go to university.

104
00:08:23,29 --> 00:08:27,65
It was easier to be paid to do
research on social sciences

105
00:08:27,66 --> 00:08:32,24
and how the family was breaking
down and hand you into personal

106
00:08:32,24 --> 00:08:35,57
and family structures and
economic structures were needed.

107
00:08:35,65 --> 00:08:37,87
And we just saw the opportunity to go out

108
00:08:37,87 --> 00:08:39,89
and start doing instead
of just talking about it.

109
00:08:40,80 --> 00:08:45,18
I member the couple of years before i left
i organised a course called a family in

110
00:08:45,18 --> 00:08:48,81
the modern world in the behavioral
sciences school with contributions from

111
00:08:48,81 --> 00:08:51,54
sociologists and psychologists and.

112
00:08:51,56 --> 00:08:56,97
And through policies and after
having all sorts of people speak in

113
00:08:56,97 --> 00:09:00,71
that course including people who had
come up and lived near me and already.

114
00:09:01,10 --> 00:09:04,98
It was just time for any of us who
could to go up and actually do it

115
00:09:04,98 --> 00:09:07,15
and not just talk about

116
00:09:07,15 --> 00:09:13,12
and theorise about it.

117
00:09:13,14 --> 00:09:16,33
Well in the early days even in the
early years. It was wonderful.

118
00:09:16,47 --> 00:09:18,67
It was a it was a celebration
it was an adventure.

119
00:09:19,01 --> 00:09:21,83
It was found it was very creative.

120
00:09:22,63 --> 00:09:27,15
We are abuzz with talk about how
to build times and dodecahedron as

121
00:09:27,15 --> 00:09:31,33
and how to put on water supplies from
hydraulic rams which didnt need any

122
00:09:32,45 --> 00:09:38,93
electricity and all sorts of alternate
ways of refrigeration and fish farming

123
00:09:38,93 --> 00:09:42,91
and agriculture that didnt need
chemicals and didn't abuse animals

124
00:09:42,91 --> 00:09:49,75
and new forms of relationships and looking
after children and our own music and.

125
00:09:50,97 --> 00:09:55,15
Just really all facets of
life. It was fascinating.

126
00:09:55,58 --> 00:09:59,53
It was energetic it was
very colourful. Where you.

127
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:01,32
We wouldn't touch alcohol because

128
00:10:01,32 --> 00:10:06,10
that was a the drug of the older generation
we smoke a lot of dope in a very

129
00:10:06,10 --> 00:10:08,75
celebrate tree sort of.

130
00:10:08,76 --> 00:10:13,06
Happy way rather than trying to
wipe ourselves out in any sense

131
00:10:13,06 --> 00:10:16,94
that was really the last thing that
any of us would would want to do at

132
00:10:16,95 --> 00:10:21,21
that stage because life was so
full of possibilities and houses

133
00:10:21,22 --> 00:10:24,95
and dams to be built in water supplies
to be put on and new ways of living

134
00:10:24,95 --> 00:10:31,25
and thinking to be found a new religion to
explore new aspects of the the internal

135
00:10:31,25 --> 00:10:33,39
world through through
psychedelics and so on.

136
00:10:34,87 --> 00:10:40,32
And i remember saturday mornings in the
promenade mornings where everyone would

137
00:10:40,32 --> 00:10:42,66
come from there. From their week of.

138
00:10:43,20 --> 00:10:47,62
Trying to get their new life style going
to to wear their colors and parade up

139
00:10:47,62 --> 00:10:51,96
and down and talk to one another in the
shannon market and a couple of the was

140
00:10:51,97 --> 00:10:53,13
that was the first market and

141
00:10:53,13 --> 00:10:56,15
that was the monthly get together
with people from other villages

142
00:10:56,15 --> 00:11:01,33
and people too far away to see
in the main on saturday morning.

143
00:11:01,34 --> 00:11:06,50
And the best thing about the shannon market
was coffee because we don't we're all.

144
00:11:06,51 --> 00:11:09,62
Reasonably city folks and.

145
00:11:09,64 --> 00:11:22,04
That was probably a really
important thing in our lives.

146
00:11:22,06 --> 00:11:25,08
The car in your experiment was.

147
00:11:25,10 --> 00:11:28,24
Was a bit different to the women
one in that it was so isolated

148
00:11:28,24 --> 00:11:32,61
and such a vast area and it really needed.

149
00:11:32,63 --> 00:11:35,51
Probably a dozen people

150
00:11:35,52 --> 00:11:41,32
or families to be there at once in order
to get such a big place going to do

151
00:11:41,32 --> 00:11:45,69
something about the rivers far
as supplying regular water and.

152
00:11:45,99 --> 00:11:49,50
Accommodation and we would
only go to town once a week

153
00:11:50,45 --> 00:11:53,53
and the difficulty was carolinians
that we somehow just didn't get

154
00:11:53,53 --> 00:11:58,96
that many people coming at once.

155
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,08
That was the only downside otherwise it was
it was quite wonderful to be a long way

156
00:12:05,08 --> 00:12:08,08
away from home in. And in a very special

157
00:12:08,08 --> 00:12:15,42
and vast place.

158
00:12:15,44 --> 00:12:20,53
They didn't they didn't because.

159
00:12:20,55 --> 00:12:25,46
I think mainly because not all 20
shareholders came over and made it go

160
00:12:25,46 --> 00:12:27,48
and we would have needed that many almost

161
00:12:27,48 --> 00:12:32,11
that many to to do the sorts
of projects that we wanted to

162
00:12:32,11 --> 00:12:34,74
and we needed everybody to
bring all of the capital

163
00:12:34,74 --> 00:12:40,33
and all of the time to the place and
get it going and when we came to carry

164
00:12:40,33 --> 00:12:40,80
when you're in

165
00:12:40,80 --> 00:12:44,54
when we bought it it looked like the quality
of life in the cities was declining

166
00:12:44,54 --> 00:12:48,99
faily rapidly there was also an oil
crisis on where for some reason the opec

167
00:12:48,99 --> 00:12:51,08
countries cut their supplies
because they thought

168
00:12:53,26 --> 00:12:57,10
that this their supply of oil
was quite finite and limited.

169
00:12:57,11 --> 00:13:03,01
And now they don't think that anymore
so they produce more but at that time.

170
00:13:03,02 --> 00:13:06,19
There was some urgency in
finding alternate ways of life

171
00:13:06,19 --> 00:13:10,33
that didn't depend on fossil
fuels and limited resources.

172
00:13:11,41 --> 00:13:16,71
But about concurrently with
1975 76 when we went up there.

173
00:13:17,54 --> 00:13:19,98
The oil crisis sort of
passed the past over

174
00:13:19,98 --> 00:13:24,00
and things in the cities started
to get gradually better.

175
00:13:25,07 --> 00:13:30,33
And somehow not enough people
were really willing to to sell up

176
00:13:30,33 --> 00:13:32,48
and bring all their time and
all their resources to go.

177
00:13:32,48 --> 00:13:37,27
We need to make it to make it work and i
think it was such an ambitious project

178
00:13:37,27 --> 00:13:39,71
that it needed all that time and energy

179
00:13:39,71 --> 00:13:45,36
and money to to make a go of it so it
turned out rather than be a real distant

180
00:13:45,36 --> 00:13:45,86
retreat.

181
00:13:47,90 --> 00:13:51,91
And at one stage we had plans of turning
it over to the national parks association

182
00:13:51,91 --> 00:13:56,99
to make a national park of the whole
thing. And it's pretty much that now.

183
00:14:05,28 --> 00:14:09,06
We're aiming for a real self-sufficiency
we're aiming for a place which really

184
00:14:09,06 --> 00:14:10,12
could take care

185
00:14:10,99 --> 00:14:17,05
and be a complete country almost
a self-sufficient country.

186
00:14:17,07 --> 00:14:21,49
For and for a group of people.

187
00:14:21,50 --> 00:14:26,62
And we had the idea we had in mind was the
hut river province in western australia

188
00:14:26,62 --> 00:14:29,59
which was an area of land
in western australia

189
00:14:29,59 --> 00:14:35,30
that fellow callings of prince rupert
took over and he issued his own stamps

190
00:14:35,30 --> 00:14:38,78
and banknotes and seceded from the
commonwealth probably not legally

191
00:14:39,69 --> 00:14:44,01
and in fact the lawyer who had
been helping him to arrange all

192
00:14:44,01 --> 00:14:49,24
that business was in contact with a
lawyer john accidents in the uk in listen

193
00:14:49,24 --> 00:14:51,78
or who. Who we got in contact with

194
00:14:51,78 --> 00:14:55,88
and he was a lawyer for carolinian so we
were thinking along those sorts of lines

195
00:14:55,88 --> 00:15:00,90
it was going to be totally self-sufficient
high tech new age. Sort of place.

196
00:15:02,35 --> 00:15:08,03
And when that scale of the new
the new world didn't work.

197
00:15:09,07 --> 00:15:14,07
Many of us came back to what the others
who left the cities were doing weren't

198
00:15:14,07 --> 00:15:18,07
prepared to go back to the city but we
came to nimbin or balance in places like

199
00:15:18,07 --> 00:15:22,25
that where where it was
more people intensive and.

200
00:15:22,77 --> 00:15:26,98
Where there was already and new
culture and plenty of music

201
00:15:26,98 --> 00:15:30,99
and plenty of company and. New school
through our children and so on.

202
00:15:32,10 --> 00:15:34,52
That became important as we
were getting slightly older

203
00:15:34,52 --> 00:15:38,49
and we were starting to have kids and
kids were getting to school age.

204
00:15:38,50 --> 00:15:41,61
So i left cairo in your
eventually in came to nimbin

205
00:15:41,61 --> 00:15:46,17
and was involved in setting
up an image community school.

206
00:15:46,18 --> 00:15:52,72
Just at the time a daughter
was turning five. That was.

207
00:15:54,19 --> 00:15:58,90
Yeah the community school was
it was set up basically by.

208
00:16:00,93 --> 00:16:05,58
John gagan dharti smith there were two
schoolteachers who had worked mainly in.

209
00:16:06,11 --> 00:16:10,52
Independent schools before. John it.

210
00:16:10,96 --> 00:16:15,72
Karen baena in north sydney.

211
00:16:15,74 --> 00:16:21,73
And it was a school which was taught
completely by parents parents all each anyone

212
00:16:21,73 --> 00:16:24,58
who had their children they had to do a
day a week at the school whether it was

213
00:16:25,88 --> 00:16:28,49
taken into kids swimming or
teaching something in particular or

214
00:16:28,49 --> 00:16:34,31
or maintaining the building or
whatever. In a couple of people.

215
00:16:34,53 --> 00:16:37,41
John and dorothy and myself
did about three days a week.

216
00:16:37,65 --> 00:16:42,40
They just just because we wanted to
we got grants straight away from the

217
00:16:42,40 --> 00:16:47,40
commonwealth government
to set up the school

218
00:16:49,25 --> 00:16:53,85
and the grants continued for over the
five or six years that i was there.

219
00:16:54,92 --> 00:17:01,41
We had usually about 50 kids from
about age five to five to 12

220
00:17:02,70 --> 00:17:06,57
just a primary school. And
basically what happens is it is

221
00:17:06,57 --> 00:17:08,44
that the kids were very happy to be there

222
00:17:08,44 --> 00:17:10,95
and thrive there till they
were about 10 years old

223
00:17:10,95 --> 00:17:13,23
when they wanted to go to the real
school and have real teachers

224
00:17:13,23 --> 00:17:18,64
and wear uniforms and took all the
things that we were escaping from.

225
00:17:19,58 --> 00:17:21,77
And it was wonderful.

226
00:17:21,88 --> 00:17:25,29
We had sort of formal classes in the
mornings in the afternoons we played music

227
00:17:25,29 --> 00:17:27,92
and went swimming and went
bushwalking and exploring

228
00:17:27,92 --> 00:17:32,83
and visiting farms in the
back of jeeps and going on.

229
00:17:32,84 --> 00:17:36,30
We went a lot of excursions all around
the country to join our own caves

230
00:17:36,30 --> 00:17:38,36
or to the fraser island

231
00:17:38,36 --> 00:17:42,10
when we used to just take a
couple of company vans in a jeep

232
00:17:42,10 --> 00:17:46,82
and take our 50 kids and live
self-sufficiently and cook

233
00:17:46,82 --> 00:17:54,39
and so on.

234
00:17:55,18 --> 00:17:58,17
Very strong i think the idea
was a did to continuation of.

235
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,27
Parenting in the school system
up to the age of about 10.

236
00:18:03,73 --> 00:18:07,77
And i think it turned out to be most
appropriate a really good model we of course

237
00:18:07,77 --> 00:18:09,68
thought that we could
keep on doing it until

238
00:18:10,56 --> 00:18:12,20
and go through high school
with our own school

239
00:18:12,20 --> 00:18:13,73
but the kids voted with their feet

240
00:18:13,73 --> 00:18:17,09
and they just they didn't want to be taught
by their parents after they were about

241
00:18:17,09 --> 00:18:21,88
10 and they usually all had a
little bit of trouble and issue.

242
00:18:22,12 --> 00:18:25,77
Three months of travel in transition
to the public school system

243
00:18:25,77 --> 00:18:27,04
and then they after

244
00:18:27,04 --> 00:18:32,85
that they did very well extremely well.

245
00:18:32,87 --> 00:18:37,24
We had the best part of school
probably was the excursions.

246
00:18:38,04 --> 00:18:42,71
As i said where we would not be
worried about insurance and so on.

247
00:18:42,77 --> 00:18:46,38
Like all the other schoolteachers would
be and just take the kids anywhere

248
00:18:46,38 --> 00:18:54,12
that was interesting to their education.

249
00:18:55,71 --> 00:18:58,21
The other aspects were
really really the music

250
00:18:58,21 --> 00:19:01,44
and the festivals the dimensions
of sort of magic and spirituality

251
00:19:01,44 --> 00:19:07,62
and in life which was so much missing in
the city and they were really combined.

252
00:19:07,94 --> 00:19:11,54
Right from the beginning we had things
called healing festivals where we would all

253
00:19:11,54 --> 00:19:16,39
en mass go to someplace by a
river on somebody's property

254
00:19:16,39 --> 00:19:20,74
or in the national park
somewhere and it was.

255
00:19:21,48 --> 00:19:23,82
It was like a festival or a bizarre of.

256
00:19:24,27 --> 00:19:29,25
Of healing techniques and meditation
techniques and dancing in music

257
00:19:30,05 --> 00:19:34,11
and this would be a big blackboard where
anyone who could offer anything in the way

258
00:19:34,11 --> 00:19:40,67
of skills of healing or health
for meditation or celebration.

259
00:19:41,88 --> 00:19:44,77
Would write up. Some time of
the day when that would be on.

260
00:19:45,44 --> 00:19:50,14
So i would start off early in the morning
at sunrise with some kind of meditation

261
00:19:50,14 --> 00:19:56,40
and continue through the day we would
cook community we wash each other's hair

262
00:19:56,40 --> 00:19:59,95
community and that night we'd finish.

263
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,80
Health with them with music in the morning
with every morning we'd have big circles

264
00:20:04,80 --> 00:20:06,86
where one sat in a huge
circle which might cover.

265
00:20:07,76 --> 00:20:13,89
You know a quarter an acre
of land and. We chant and.

266
00:20:13,91 --> 00:20:15,75
Hound.

267
00:20:15,77 --> 00:20:19,85
And then those who felt in need of some
sort of feeling of support would sit in the

268
00:20:19,85 --> 00:20:20,78
middle of the circle and

269
00:20:20,78 --> 00:20:25,95
and then all sorts of things would happen
in the way of new age healing techniques

270
00:20:25,95 --> 00:20:32,47
and singing and meditating and.
Channeling energy and so on and so on.

271
00:20:34,08 --> 00:20:39,88
So they were the healing vessels which you
probably have no four five times a year

272
00:20:41,18 --> 00:20:44,65
every full moon we had moon dances because
the power of the moon is so strong in

273
00:20:44,65 --> 00:20:48,99
the country. That you
just need to dance to.

274
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:52,86
To get the devil there they haven't
celebrate your energy every every time it's

275
00:20:52,86 --> 00:20:57,24
full moon and in between
there were a couple times

276
00:20:57,24 --> 00:21:01,37
that there was a folk
club every every monday.

277
00:21:01,39 --> 00:21:03,15
Where people played folk music

278
00:21:03,15 --> 00:21:07,85
but it was all us doing all these things
to each other with we shampooing each

279
00:21:07,85 --> 00:21:12,42
other's hair or playing music to one another
or building each other's houses of.

280
00:21:12,44 --> 00:21:16,99
Celebrating dancing cooking washing.

281
00:21:17,72 --> 00:21:20,39
It was just wonderful to
suddenly be part of a tribe

282
00:21:20,39 --> 00:21:26,46
and suddenly away from eventually away
from the stifling sort of nuclear families

283
00:21:26,46 --> 00:21:27,94
of the the 50s

284
00:21:27,94 --> 00:21:35,89
and early 60s.

285
00:21:35,90 --> 00:21:42,22
Very very much. It was an adventure
and it was fun. And someone.

286
00:21:42,97 --> 00:21:44,92
People were often asking
what are hippies about

287
00:21:44,92 --> 00:21:51,83
and we always said hippies have found. It
was a really colourful celebrate tree.

288
00:21:52,99 --> 00:21:54,04
Creative adventure.

289
00:21:54,53 --> 00:21:56,41
And when i get an imminent days

290
00:21:56,41 --> 00:21:59,88
and i see what other people
call hippies walking along.

291
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,45
Straight it just isn't the same
breed of human being and so.

292
00:22:04,47 --> 00:22:06,42
It's sort of left over.

293
00:22:10,85 --> 00:22:15,65
Of of a real a real colourful age that i
think is that i think is now past and

294
00:22:16,37 --> 00:22:23,31
and in retrospect i think it was.
Part of a certain age in one's life.

295
00:22:24,83 --> 00:22:29,28
Early in the 20s basically the
years during the 20s when.

296
00:22:29,30 --> 00:22:34,29
When i still think a young person's got no
business jumping straight into the mold

297
00:22:34,29 --> 00:22:35,69
that their parents have left.

298
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:40,36
And where they should be out exploring
new ways and celebrating their life

299
00:22:40,36 --> 00:22:43,59
and their youth and energy and sexuality

300
00:22:43,59 --> 00:22:47,75
and ability to take drugs without
being too hurt by them and so on

301
00:22:47,75 --> 00:22:54,75
and so on. And it seems very natural for
me and for other people now to have.

302
00:22:56,49 --> 00:23:00,38
As we've got older to gradually go back
into the world into the hopefully have a

303
00:23:01,97 --> 00:23:03,17
bit of a dimension of magic

304
00:23:03,17 --> 00:23:07,51
and spirituality in what we do in our
everyday life as a result of having spent 10

305
00:23:07,51 --> 00:23:11,89
years being out of the
mainstream of society and.

306
00:23:11,91 --> 00:23:15,83
Being able to celebrate and be in touch
with our energy and creativity and.

307
00:23:16,35 --> 00:23:17,98
Just adventures sense of adventure.

308
00:23:19,14 --> 00:23:22,23
I suppose in other generations people
have had new countries to explore.

309
00:23:23,83 --> 00:23:26,31
We had the inside of our minds to explore

310
00:23:26,31 --> 00:23:28,49
and all sorts of possibilities
a relationship.

311
00:23:29,08 --> 00:23:34,31
That we just stifled in the in a
very comfortable way that people

312
00:23:34,31 --> 00:23:55,10
that our parents were
living in in the cities.

313
00:23:56,74 --> 00:24:03,33
If you would be that. I mean.

314
00:24:03,35 --> 00:24:05,48
What's happened to me in the last.

315
00:24:06,56 --> 00:24:12,83
Let's see the last 15 years 10 15
years is that after living on four

316
00:24:12,83 --> 00:24:17,22
or five different communes i
bought my own piece of property.

317
00:24:18,16 --> 00:24:19,85
I bought this property
because it was lovely and.

318
00:24:20,51 --> 00:24:23,77
Had some remnants of rainforest
on but it was mainly grass and.

319
00:24:25,27 --> 00:24:30,49
The farmer next door came over and talked
me into into having some cattle on it

320
00:24:30,49 --> 00:24:31,88
and showed me how to how to do it

321
00:24:31,88 --> 00:24:35,83
and now the property breeds
hereford cattle which.

322
00:24:36,40 --> 00:24:41,21
Half of which eventually you can't get eaten
is meat though people including myself

323
00:24:42,32 --> 00:24:42,50
and.

324
00:24:44,37 --> 00:24:50,56
And now i'm a psychologist in private
practice doing medico legal assessments of

325
00:24:50,56 --> 00:24:51,08
the system

326
00:24:52,37 --> 00:24:57,74
and probably four fifths of my former
friends have also gone back to

327
00:24:59,49 --> 00:25:00,99
back into the world. I call it.

328
00:25:01,55 --> 00:25:05,89
In positions of authority and
responsibility and so on.

329
00:25:07,25 --> 00:25:12,58
Positions where i can offer direction
and guidance and an example to.

330
00:25:12,60 --> 00:25:18,75
Two people. None of us who've done that a
really horrified by what's happened and.

331
00:25:19,44 --> 00:25:24,70
And we look back on our 10
years or so of being hippies

332
00:25:24,70 --> 00:25:27,37
and had of having led the system with.

333
00:25:27,39 --> 00:25:30,18
With thinking that we
would never have not done

334
00:25:30,18 --> 00:25:33,76
that it was a wonderful thing to do
a wonderful time of our lives and

335
00:25:34,82 --> 00:25:37,41
that seemed to be the right thing
to do at that stage of our lives

336
00:25:37,41 --> 00:25:41,67
and this thing this seems to be the right
thing to do now there are a couple of

337
00:25:41,67 --> 00:25:44,81
people who perhaps from our
point of view haven't made

338
00:25:44,81 --> 00:25:49,72
that transition still sort of fighting
it out on the streets of niman but

339
00:25:49,72 --> 00:25:52,61
but they don't have an audience any more.

340
00:25:53,74 --> 00:25:55,44
In my mind it just isn't
happening anymore.

341
00:25:57,00 --> 00:25:59,93
A lot of the things that we thought
we knew and were fighting for now be.

342
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,50
I'm part of the mainstream of society
and of course that's a good thing.

343
00:26:06,64 --> 00:26:11,24
But i'm i'm waiting now for
my. My daughter's generation.

344
00:26:12,96 --> 00:26:18,02
To find find some way of really questioning
what's going on with this crazy

345
00:26:18,02 --> 00:26:22,94
economic rationalism and absence of
jobs and opinions on jobs in the room

346
00:26:22,94 --> 00:26:24,06
and gloom of the present age

347
00:26:24,06 --> 00:26:30,85
and wondering why they are finding some
new territory of of the world of the

348
00:26:30,85 --> 00:26:32,57
mind to start exploring in ways that

349
00:26:32,57 --> 00:26:36,97
that we didn't i think we've done our
are exploring and had our age of doing

350
00:26:36,97 --> 00:26:42,74
that and i'm more than happy to
be to be back in the world now.

351
00:26:42,76 --> 00:26:47,20
I think much strengthened
and and broadened by by

352
00:26:47,21 --> 00:26:58,52
that experience.

353
00:27:00,63 --> 00:27:01,66
It's hard. I mean i.

354
00:27:02,05 --> 00:27:03,64
My immediate answer to

355
00:27:03,64 --> 00:27:10,22
that is is of course i
often wonder whether

356
00:27:10,22 --> 00:27:14,59
i'm often asked whether we lost we've lost
those of us who have returned gone back

357
00:27:14,59 --> 00:27:19,40
into the world of somehow
ditched their ideals

358
00:27:19,40 --> 00:27:22,02
but my very strong feeling is

359
00:27:22,02 --> 00:27:27,12
that that's just just part of us now.

360
00:27:27,14 --> 00:27:32,58
Some of us still grow our own veggies
but some of the still live community

361
00:27:32,58 --> 00:27:33,08
but not many.

362
00:27:34,64 --> 00:27:38,52
And most of those things which we would
probably take as the is the real external

363
00:27:38,52 --> 00:27:43,85
indicators of what it was to be a
hippie we now don't do anymore but.

364
00:27:44,65 --> 00:27:49,53
All i can think now is that
i feel a real richness and.

365
00:27:51,50 --> 00:27:54,59
That bit of magic in spirituality which i
don't think i would have had by this time

366
00:27:54,59 --> 00:27:59,80
if i'd stayed living in the city in the
mold that my parents generation it's.

367
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:21,21
It up for us.

368
00:28:21,23 --> 00:28:24,78
I think it had to do with the whole thing
i think it even had to do with sort of

369
00:28:24,78 --> 00:28:30,29
inner exploring through the
use of psychedelic drugs and.

370
00:28:31,27 --> 00:28:35,61
Just meeting new new challenges as something
that was very much a turning inward.

371
00:28:37,95 --> 00:28:41,22
And knowing that there's a whole
richness and magic inside you

372
00:28:41,22 --> 00:28:43,47
that your mind is not just.

373
00:28:46,08 --> 00:28:50,15
Just some sort of capacity to
follow an economic rationalist idea

374
00:28:50,15 --> 00:28:51,36
and work harder

375
00:28:51,36 --> 00:28:57,54
and accumulate things it's a real happiness
sometimes to just be by yourself

376
00:28:58,49 --> 00:29:00,98
which we got from a meditation i say

377
00:29:00,98 --> 00:29:02,88
that meditation something you
can take anywhere with you

378
00:29:02,88 --> 00:29:04,45
and you don't mean the equipment for it

379
00:29:05,16 --> 00:29:09,72
and even still the world is so permeated
with other people trying to sell you

380
00:29:09,72 --> 00:29:15,18
things in order to make life interesting
or make you healthy or make you happy

381
00:29:15,18 --> 00:29:18,01
and once you've been
meditating for a long time.

382
00:29:18,17 --> 00:29:22,57
You know that the best way to be
healthy and happy in and to feel magic

383
00:29:22,57 --> 00:29:25,62
and interest is to simply
sit down and be peaceful

384
00:29:25,62 --> 00:29:29,40
and there's a whole world
inside there to look at.

385
00:29:29,42 --> 00:29:36,01
I think the fact that we came
out of the city at that age.

386
00:29:36,72 --> 00:29:37,00
Means

387
00:29:37,01 --> 00:29:41,38
that we just got a real closeness to nature
which which we wouldn't have had before

388
00:29:43,00 --> 00:29:45,75
and in many cases we've got a love

389
00:29:45,75 --> 00:29:50,64
and a closeness to nature which even some
of the old farmers don't have because we

390
00:29:50,64 --> 00:29:53,60
had that the luxury that
the opportunity there.

391
00:29:53,64 --> 00:29:59,58
The joy of being able to walk around and
look at it. With our mind stimulated with.

392
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,68
Good quality marijuana itself and. While
the old farmers are working hard.

393
00:30:06,54 --> 00:30:09,71
Kind of pretending they're
enjoying very out there

394
00:30:10,75 --> 00:30:14,55
and many of them kind of tend when i retire
to move into town in the brick house

395
00:30:14,55 --> 00:30:17,84
and spend their days in the
arras el club with the walls

396
00:30:17,84 --> 00:30:23,88
and floors covered with carpeted the
artificial lights of poker machines.

397
00:30:23,90 --> 00:30:28,93
You know i look forward to retiring being
able to look at the different lights in

398
00:30:28,93 --> 00:30:32,29
the countryside and maybe learning
to capture them in water colours

399
00:30:33,76 --> 00:30:38,58
and returning in a sense to those lovely
happy days when we had endless time and

400
00:30:39,57 --> 00:30:42,46
and we could see that the.

401
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:46,70
The world in the mind was
endless and the mysterious

402
00:30:46,70 --> 00:31:05,65
and so on.

403
00:31:05,67 --> 00:31:07,03
And i think that.

404
00:31:08,32 --> 00:31:10,04
A lot of the things

405
00:31:10,05 --> 00:31:15,33
that we came up here specifically to do
like to get away from nuclear families to

406
00:31:15,33 --> 00:31:19,83
get away from monogamy to get
away from private property. And.

407
00:31:20,39 --> 00:31:26,92
And to go tribal and and so
on has really not worked out.

408
00:31:28,81 --> 00:31:32,85
And in some ways it doesn't matter because
they were only in retrospect they were

409
00:31:32,85 --> 00:31:36,47
only kind of symptoms of what was
wrong and how we felt trapped

410
00:31:36,47 --> 00:31:43,24
and how we felt very one dimensional
and in our lives in the city.

411
00:31:43,25 --> 00:31:47,50
You can you can we found out that you
can have a closeness to each other.

412
00:31:47,79 --> 00:31:52,87
Physical closeness of trust a sort of
injured interactive life with each other

413
00:31:52,87 --> 00:32:02,99
without.
