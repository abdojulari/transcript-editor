1
00:00:09,66 --> 00:00:14,66
This is Station four take four side.

2
00:00:14,68 --> 00:00:40,66
And the second time you are talking about the bank and the restrictions that are placed on people.

3
00:00:43,73 --> 00:00:49,61
Now these men were most of them.

4
00:00:50,35 --> 00:01:02,28
Kind films and had moved to the to eat and valuable part comfortable I had their own banana farms or market gardens

5
00:01:02,28 --> 00:01:05,28
and I saw there is stuff.

6
00:01:06,27 --> 00:01:19,08
And there is money in all the money went into work in the bank the savings bank as it was and then. Well.

7
00:01:19,83 --> 00:01:28,2
They were in town. One day and I thought they did. That in the States the banks are all closed.

8
00:01:28,22 --> 00:01:33,4
So I thought I'd go to the banker or get a money help this Friday.

9
00:01:33,42 --> 00:01:42,65
And there must be in about twenty of them went to the bank when I got there the door's closed.

10
00:01:42,67 --> 00:01:46,64
So they say to each other. Being there but his power.

11
00:01:47,24 --> 00:01:55,14
You gotta get him Tom I hope we knock on this one from the back door. Yeah.

12
00:01:55,48 --> 00:02:07,4
Give me that my own food I break in this glass window. That man I was money well. This went on home owning.

13
00:02:07,83 --> 00:02:09,5
I'm a local cops came and said.

14
00:02:09,66 --> 00:02:17,12
You can't go on like this and I turned on the course and I said that one problem bank of money blow. You.

15
00:02:17,76 --> 00:02:19,31
We wanted that money.

16
00:02:20,25 --> 00:02:21,05
Well this went on

17
00:02:21,05 --> 00:02:28,69
and family who would police at the police call the bank manager the arm through the window to open up

18
00:02:28,69 --> 00:02:36,8
and let them have their money but these were the things that were happening and.

19
00:02:37,57 --> 00:02:39,69
It was I realize now

20
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:48,57
but I realized how distressed the older people were to think that the bank that I had so much faith

21
00:02:48,57 --> 00:02:53,09
and trust that looked after the humanity that gave him a bit of interest

22
00:02:53,99 --> 00:03:00,63
and made them feel secure was no longer there really was no longer the.

23
00:03:06,52 --> 00:03:16,86
Depression stuff just before we played the depression would you like to say what your first job was what you actually

24
00:03:16,86 --> 00:03:29,87
did when you decided to leave school and start working. Well first of all I. I got a job immediately or left school.

25
00:03:29,88 --> 00:03:40,28
Which was a very unusual thing in the depths of the Depression and that was with first class. And I learnt a lot from.

26
00:03:41,42 --> 00:03:48,4
The whole Tom. Like a couple of afternoons who we choose a very lovely person.

27
00:03:48,99 --> 00:03:54,31
She had a thriving business even in the Depression because what she made was so beautiful

28
00:03:55,07 --> 00:03:59,58
and there were still people with money handful or they were.

29
00:03:59,6 --> 00:04:07,6
So I would watch her and she teach me how to be the clothes and be beaten.

30
00:04:11,75 --> 00:04:20,53
She was just really good to me then one day she said. If you want to a few more.

31
00:04:21,69 --> 00:04:33,71
Women up the hill like you to do some work and if it's raining money because people couldn't get a job anywhere.

32
00:04:34,91 --> 00:04:41,05
And so I ended up working for this woman I'd leave him at six in the morning walk the mile and a half or two

33
00:04:41,05 --> 00:04:47,76
or whatever it was get there in the morning go down and pick up the meat for breakfast for her boarders

34
00:04:48,52 --> 00:04:52,84
and come back and help her to cook the breakfast for them. And when they'd all gone.

35
00:04:53,07 --> 00:05:03,31
Then I'd wash up all the issues with her. And. And that went on for two three years. Those two chair opposite.

36
00:05:05,96 --> 00:05:13,2
It went on until the war or close to the war because once the war once was and I would cook

37
00:05:13,2 --> 00:05:19,51
and that's what I learned to do a lot of cooking in actual fact good plain stuff you know because my mother didn't

38
00:05:19,51 --> 00:05:24,89
teach me a thing not to think she couldn't be bothered if she couldn't do it so she wouldn't bother verite.

39
00:05:26,82 --> 00:05:39,2
So I had like sponge cakes I think of that today. You know I could turn a sponge cake out of a few.

40
00:05:40,54 --> 00:05:54,15
Declared you know one hundred thirty nine in September. And it was it happened overnight. Let the good jobs everywhere.

41
00:05:54,17 --> 00:06:09,59
The men were enlisting. And they were whatever jobs they had women were moving in to take them. So. Some.

42
00:06:09,66 --> 00:06:17,91
One once said Well if it didn't do it took the loss of many people. It took a lot of lives to end a depression.

43
00:06:17,93 --> 00:06:23,98
And that was in fact what happened because the world the manufacturing of ammunition

44
00:06:24,68 --> 00:06:40,08
and particularly ply all that of war ships and it required people to do that and that worked better in the Depression.

45
00:06:40,1 --> 00:06:40,61
OK.
