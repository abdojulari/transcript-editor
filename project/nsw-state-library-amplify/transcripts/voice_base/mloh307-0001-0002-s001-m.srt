00:00:34,41 --> 00:00:41,64
Identification. This is the second station with FAITH BANDLER and Carolyn Craig recorded on Friday.

2
00:00:41,67 --> 00:00:44,12
Second of May one thousand nine hundred seven.

3
00:00:44,91 --> 00:01:02,84
So this is tape two side one and the tape begins in ten seconds time and divide into sick ation.

4
00:01:02,85 --> 00:01:08,66
Faith at the end of last session. You were telling me about your father's death.

5
00:01:09,27 --> 00:01:22,11
And that there were those a funeral where many many many people came to the grave was deep in the grave digger is stood

6
00:01:22,12 --> 00:01:32,61
with all our friends while my father's coffin was lowered into the grave. And.

7
00:01:33,72 --> 00:01:41,96
The women in particular who had taken flowers from their own gardens great gardeners.

8
00:01:42,24 --> 00:01:51,12
Now all and woman was without her flower garden. And you know the grave began to fill with flowers.

9
00:01:52,28 --> 00:01:59,03
They threw the flowers on top of the coffin and read your. Purple those early years.

10
00:01:59,24 --> 00:02:10,79
And quite daisies and cream roses and and these women stood around and just threw the flowers onto the coffin.

11
00:02:12,24 --> 00:02:24,42
And then my brothers shovel it on the coffin because they wanted to do it and I know that normally the undertaker

12
00:02:25,22 --> 00:02:32,64
or the grave diggers usually did that but let's step back with. The crowd and I can remember my brothers.

13
00:02:34,12 --> 00:02:42,99
Trailing the gray with the red. And. My mother went around and said to everyone.

14
00:02:44,35 --> 00:02:55,9
We're going now to Katie and Charlie's place and Katie and Charlie Charlie Charlie was my father's brother.

15
00:02:56,58 --> 00:03:03,04
And Katie was his wife. And their house because.

16
00:03:03,06 --> 00:03:15,72
It was about a mile and a half from the post-office and it was a hot place. It had three tanks.

17
00:03:17,3 --> 00:03:24,9
And it was surrounded by a tree and mound retrace and from the bank a tree.

18
00:03:24,92 --> 00:03:36,51
My uncle Charlie had begged water bags hanging. To cool the water for people to drink it and that my hot.

19
00:03:36,52 --> 00:03:39,1
And although it was the month of July.

20
00:03:39,12 --> 00:03:50,39
They'd been walking a long way to get to the few know many of them and then I had to now walk to Uncle Charlie and.

21
00:03:50,84 --> 00:03:56,8
Auntie Katie's place. And it's true that.

22
00:04:00,63 --> 00:04:10,89
The by the family who were smart history ten months or old myself and my other two sisters were put into care.

23
00:04:10,91 --> 00:04:22,48
That was drawn by two horses was to three two. I think. And we were taken out in the cab.

24
00:04:23,9 --> 00:04:35,7
So we were first there and Katie was in the cab as well. And when we got there. She. Sort of shook the coals.

25
00:04:36,26 --> 00:04:45,00
Pre-heated the stoves again she had to use. Their caterers and Kate was for Coke.

26
00:04:45,58 --> 00:04:55,5
And she had been brought from the island of Amber I'm a young girl of about eleven or twelve thing

27
00:04:56,46 --> 00:05:02,4
and she was installed in this house and I and it was there she didn't learn

28
00:05:02,4 --> 00:05:10,28
but she developed cooking skills because her mistress had no idea whatsoever.

29
00:05:10,29 --> 00:05:23,00
And so she mastered the art of making brain and making batter. And just cooking. So it was wonderful.

30
00:05:23,21 --> 00:05:30,63
Why she cooked for a couple of days. And there were poems of.

31
00:05:30,65 --> 00:05:39,37
That are a wonderful gloss on them and she put a cross on it just for the fun. And beautiful scar.

32
00:05:39,95 --> 00:05:48,71
And sponge cakes filled with Jerram and cream and then only other stuff and they opened fire

33
00:05:48,71 --> 00:05:57,33
and there was an open fire in the lean to kitchen. Where she would buy to all the chooks.

34
00:05:57,35 --> 00:06:00,91
And if she'd knocked off enough chooks to feed this mob.

35
00:06:02,82 --> 00:06:11,13
And my brothers had gone they previously had not before and I knocked the trucks off and traced them. And as I said.

36
00:06:11,22 --> 00:06:20,89
The big camper vans were full of chucks chairs huge pile of plates. He didn't eat of paper plates then and.

37
00:06:20,91 --> 00:06:35,96
Roast potatoes roast pumpkin and big balls of. Just us wonderful lent to me you're. All of this was like a miracle.

38
00:06:35,98 --> 00:06:47,58
To see you only food prepared. And. Matter and changed into matter happens for.

39
00:06:48,65 --> 00:07:00,59
My oldest sister to help them and the boys. And the people began Torah. They arrived in this and.

40
00:07:01,96 --> 00:07:10,47
There was no straight tension and they sat under the mango trees and under the Maori tree under the local tree.

41
00:07:11,99 --> 00:07:23,03
And there were great big tables that had. Their legs were built into the earth and they were covered with long quite.

42
00:07:23,05 --> 00:07:35,59
Cloths and these huge big so on and all of food was brought out and there was plenty for all plenty for all.

43
00:07:37,13 --> 00:07:51,69
And so people cry and cry. And men were sitting in the streaming. Faces and. He was good to us too.

44
00:07:51,77 --> 00:08:02,73
And the truth in fact was that no one could believe that him die because he was just always. Like a tree.

45
00:08:04,13 --> 00:08:13,6
And he was always there to hunt for comfort and I wasn't there anymore and I think the way.

46
00:08:17,13 --> 00:08:23,02
Brought about a fully realize Asian that he wasn't there and he wasn't going to be there any more.

47
00:08:24,43 --> 00:08:32,41
And all the men sat there and I cried and I cried and cried and the remarkable thing was.

48
00:08:32,84 --> 00:08:39,83
As I think of it today was that the word crash at all not even my mother.

49
00:08:39,84 --> 00:08:42,4
They were too involved with the food in fact

50
00:08:43,95 --> 00:08:52,35
and it wasn't really that I think it had to do with the fact that many of them had seen a lot of death.

51
00:08:52,43 --> 00:08:59,74
They'd seen it on the cane fields before they scraped. They'd see in the black flag.

52
00:09:00,84 --> 00:09:10,82
The children and and I with the characters. Made it worse it was somehow different.

53
00:09:11,13 --> 00:09:21,39
And certainly my father had said he was always there. And I thought he'd always be there and he'd grow old with them.

54
00:09:21,61 --> 00:09:32,08
And always be there. So in a sense a whole generation of islanders had really lent on him and relied on him.

55
00:09:33,45 --> 00:09:41,76
The whole generation of islanders two generations in fact two generations because by now like him.

56
00:09:42,11 --> 00:09:52,33
Many of them had grown up son. And I recall has a little woman. Who was a lawyer.

57
00:09:52,96 --> 00:10:02,85
And perspire father and she married a man by the name of an island man who didn't come from the same.

58
00:10:03,55 --> 00:10:10,71
As my father but my father and he were friends and they were married and you see they had thirteen children.

59
00:10:11,61 --> 00:10:22,1
So it was another generation as well. Two generations. So the weeping winter and for a long time.

60
00:10:22,25 --> 00:10:44,75
The men just sat in some set in a circle. And it stopped and it seemed to all. Stop it for us..

61
00:10:36,38 --> 00:10:43,95
I said a lot of A had been clear. And there was an acceptance. And then when the T.K.

62
00:10:44,76 --> 00:10:56,82
In my auntie Kate's Royal Albert and nothing less. I can tell you. And I asked for mags.

63
00:10:58,33 --> 00:11:02,93
My mother and sister were brought big money they wanted mine

64
00:11:02,93 --> 00:11:15,77
but all the women used the Royal Albert had written roses on it was a kind of Riccio saying for me to capture that.

65
00:11:16,38 --> 00:11:19,39
But the main began to sing and I was sitting on.

66
00:11:20,05 --> 00:11:32,48
Those who sat on the pile and boxes began to play time we think fingers fingers from hard work.

67
00:11:32,5 --> 00:11:41,83
And I was beating time and it was just like the drug of the. You know it was discipline that.

68
00:11:42,49 --> 00:11:55,48
The sea was pounding the rocks. And the beating just sort of the background and it was truly a very genuine farewell.

69
00:11:55,5 --> 00:12:03,67
And after that. But that would on for court quite some time. Then they began to sing.

70
00:12:04,37 --> 00:12:09,46
And they sang in many languages and that was the extraordinary thing about it.

71
00:12:11,5 --> 00:12:17,02
When they came into Queensland the Queensland government called them or connect us.

72
00:12:17,39 --> 00:12:26,59
And that is a whole way in which just means man and it was a city where they were thrown into a melting pot.

73
00:12:26,61 --> 00:12:34,54
But they knew the differences and they retained their cultures. They remember their songs remember. The steps of the.

74
00:12:34,56 --> 00:12:51,46
And they were on different. And the men who were there came from the island of Pentecost. Amber. And others.

75
00:12:52,16 --> 00:13:01,31
And when they were singing. They each island group would have their own songs in their own language.

76
00:13:01,89 --> 00:13:04,82
So at the same time you had these many languages

77
00:13:05,66 --> 00:13:16,76
and the various songs coming from each little group that said under the mango tree or the mulberry tree. So.

78
00:13:18,55 --> 00:13:19,33
After the singing.

79
00:13:19,78 --> 00:13:33,42
And some danced on the earth and if it made a sound like that they took their shoes off and they danced.

80
00:13:35,35 --> 00:13:47,51
And there was a period of Reacher we seen. He's got we've accepted this we have to get on with life and that it.

81
00:13:49,05 --> 00:14:06,28
And all of this when you're only about five. Now I I was six or six. Yes and it's quite vivid. So. The white.

82
00:14:06,3 --> 00:14:11,87
And pads in it was very late afternoon and the shadows were beginning to lengthen.

83
00:14:13,17 --> 00:14:18,72
And I and he Katie set off to feed the chokes she used to feed them in the paddock. You know.

84
00:14:19,37 --> 00:14:25,87
They were all free range of course free running and then she'd lock that she locked them up.

85
00:14:26,96 --> 00:14:32,36
And that was over when a person did it it was time for the visitors to go.

86
00:14:34,92 --> 00:14:43,54
I mean I've seen people in Sydney has given us all of info and we've set up. To go by getting at a vacuum cleaner.

87
00:14:43,55 --> 00:14:48,43
But here we call the chooks.

88
00:14:48,45 --> 00:14:58,06
And they were put on their coats and set off and many of those women walked a good ten miles.

89
00:14:58,17 --> 00:15:12,05
They let evening they had ten miles ahead of them to walk back again for a walk or so. And we focus.

90
00:15:12,71 --> 00:15:20,66
Stayed with that night with Auntie Katie Nicholl Chiles it was a very old rambling us.

91
00:15:20,97 --> 00:15:26,51
There was masses of room and I don't think Katie rather enjoyed it because it was a time

92
00:15:26,51 --> 00:15:29,03
when she could show off her fine linen.

93
00:15:29,71 --> 00:15:37,37
And fine it was you know and she backed up the bids with these beautiful sheets.

94
00:15:37,38 --> 00:15:46,87
And we went back to temple Holcombe the next day and we were in Paris.

95
00:15:46,88 --> 00:15:56,46
And we had a pair and the camp took us from the house to the wharf. At No one umbrella and we got on the steamer.

96
00:15:57,12 --> 00:16:06,35
And set off for Tom Bogan I really loved those trips in that Stamer it.

97
00:16:06,44 --> 00:16:15,29
The boat service was owned by a very old mole and Baradei tittie by the name of movie. Skinner.

98
00:16:15,65 --> 00:16:23,23
And he and I think about two or three is the vessels that took people down the tree drifted.

99
00:16:23,61 --> 00:16:34,08
To and it stopped at Balcombe. Then I had another stop at children. And they went on to trade.

100
00:16:34,71 --> 00:16:43,64
And what I'll have to about it if you went down in the morning with a. Ham sandwiches and tea.

101
00:16:43,66 --> 00:16:49,53
That a woman attendant on the boat would make and make sure.

102
00:16:49,55 --> 00:16:55,75
Now the kind of tea you get in restaurants here and I will bags. You have the genuine thing.

103
00:16:56,11 --> 00:17:11,7
Beautiful horse bread with batter and. Mustard. And so my mother was taken care of great tender care by this woman.

104
00:17:13,18 --> 00:17:17,32
And I remember her mother with her lovely black dress

105
00:17:18,73 --> 00:17:25,1
and she wasn't crying somehow she would accept the fact that she was now and must have been a terrible blow to.

106
00:17:25,11 --> 00:17:43,02
A dreadful. Because she had a baby that was only ten months. And. I can remember her saying the woman who served it.

107
00:17:43,04 --> 00:17:54,93
Asking my mother when you have a tissue always have at Mrs massing his place and it would have a lovely. Creamy milk.

108
00:17:55,62 --> 00:18:07,97
Lasts and strong. So we went back to our house in. And it seemed awfully lonely and empty to me.

109
00:18:09,78 --> 00:18:17,73
And I couldn't remember feeling terribly terribly. That no longer would my father come and go from here.

110
00:18:19,52 --> 00:18:29,4
Longer would he tell the story. Around the fire and no longer would he take me up to the.

111
00:18:30,28 --> 00:18:37,37
There was a terrible emptiness. So many. And it was a great lesson for me. In fact it.

112
00:18:37,98 --> 00:18:45,04
It made me fully realize how important both parents to a child.

113
00:18:45,49 --> 00:18:54,29
And I've often thought since that when I've seen marriages break up. And the husband goes off or the wife.

114
00:18:54,31 --> 00:18:59,81
And I have said to me so many of them. Look we fought so much.

115
00:18:59,84 --> 00:19:08,83
It wasn't her staying together anymore but they've never ever said how it would affect the children.

116
00:19:08,85 --> 00:19:19,98
And I think of who were next door but no longer. And when their marriage broke up. It also broke their office.

117
00:19:20,00 --> 00:19:27,59
And to this day and that happened about ten twelve years ago to do this very day she has never forgiven the parents.

118
00:19:28,71 --> 00:19:39,39
So you know I I know that children's loyalty is very divided and they really love the father

119
00:19:39,39 --> 00:19:42,73
and they left the mother but they separate they keep it separate.

120
00:19:43,05 --> 00:19:52,01
And this affected me very natural child and I experienced a sense of security after my father had gone.

121
00:19:52,03 --> 00:20:01,92
And so on till eldest brother Jerome. Virtually sat in my father's place at the head of the table.

122
00:20:03,44 --> 00:20:15,56
Could you just fill in a little bit about your siblings and the age range so that it paints a bit of a picture that.

123
00:20:15,58 --> 00:20:27,95
John was when my father died he was nineteen and he was a very very responsible person very responsible

124
00:20:29,19 --> 00:20:44,14
and it almost seemed to me years later that he. Rather enjoyed that new role of power. He actually controlled us kids.

125
00:20:44,16 --> 00:20:54,27
What to do as he said. And then you see when father died two of my siblings.

126
00:20:54,29 --> 00:21:03,43
Left her packed up and I went and lived with Child child Samantha character and one was my brother.

127
00:21:03,64 --> 00:21:16,22
Eddie who was the second eldest and of and my sister Kate who was the second eldest.

128
00:21:17,33 --> 00:21:25,36
And so they would pack their cases and they were taken to live. And go child. Kate.

129
00:21:25,42 --> 00:21:28,18
Now Uncle Charles and Kate had a lot of money.

130
00:21:28,71 --> 00:21:32,13
Because I was very careful and they'd served over the years

131
00:21:32,13 --> 00:21:43,98
and those days it paid to say because money was really worth something and they were very generous to my brother

132
00:21:43,98 --> 00:21:52,45
and narcistic they bought them bikes which we. And Kate had lovely dresses.

133
00:21:53,77 --> 00:22:00,1
And they stayed at school my brother anywhere in town to high school for about two or three years

134
00:22:00,1 --> 00:22:01,25
and that was really something.

135
00:22:03,84 --> 00:22:09,71
And he enjoyed being the sister Kate was dreadfully homesick terribly sick

136
00:22:09,71 --> 00:22:16,88
and after a short while she came back to the family in fact and brought all her dresses which we all know.

137
00:22:16,9 --> 00:22:23,91
But and thereafter. Eddie who were second eldest there was my brother Tom.

138
00:22:24,37 --> 00:22:35,33
Tom was an extraordinary he was taller in the family. He was six foot three six four I think. Straight as a telephone.

139
00:22:35,35 --> 00:22:39,9
And he was a bit of a loner. He was a great reader.

140
00:22:40,33 --> 00:22:45,00
A great reader if you'd read all the newspapers around the place and all the books you'd go

141
00:22:45,00 --> 00:22:52,63
and look at a bit of brown paper sigs Those anything written or not. And after him came member of the.

142
00:22:52,65 --> 00:23:02,65
Who with him mother wanted to christen well and it didn't work and he was a bold and reckless one of the family.

143
00:23:03,05 --> 00:23:06,21
Had a will of the refused to go to school.

144
00:23:06,58 --> 00:23:16,12
Just refused he well acted so often and wasn't funny and he was very very anxious and keen to earn money.

145
00:23:16,14 --> 00:23:28,32
So very tender age he left her and he went away and he lived with and I. Was very good to him. And so.

146
00:23:28,9 --> 00:23:35,82
He was like one of the family with him but the reason was and he was only eleven and when he did that

147
00:23:35,82 --> 00:23:40,37
and the reason why I did it he wanted the use of the horses.

148
00:23:40,39 --> 00:23:47,42
He was one who under four horsemen so wonderful that he could make the horses do anything

149
00:23:48,16 --> 00:23:51,31
and he broke horses in for the families also.

150
00:23:53,16 --> 00:24:03,9
And he'd sit on a horse and you look at him and you'd think born in the saddle. And so he came he left.

151
00:24:03,92 --> 00:24:07,97
My mother didn't worry about him because she knew very good.

152
00:24:08,5 --> 00:24:15,62
Because she knew all of these neighbors so well they went to each other's place for afternoon tea.

153
00:24:15,63 --> 00:24:27,77
And there was no problem. In fact what strikes me is that you had this novice mixed community and know no difficulties.

154
00:24:27,84 --> 00:24:39,32
Exactly. We didn't know what we do. Experienced any racial discrimination at all at all as young children.

155
00:24:40,6 --> 00:24:47,6
And we had all of these Irish Catholic families around us and they'd come for afternoon tea

156
00:24:48,75 --> 00:24:56,45
and mother would go to their place for afternoon tea and the crockery would improve their white tablecloth.

157
00:24:57,03 --> 00:25:02,89
The whole works and that was always a lot about hearing.

158
00:25:02,91 --> 00:25:11,17
We'd give them fruit and I'd give us pickles or something like that. It was a lot of exchange.

159
00:25:11,23 --> 00:25:23,61
So my brother water went off and he worked with this family. And then that was Jesse the eldest girl.

160
00:25:25,07 --> 00:25:28,76
And she was always a bit strange quite strange.

161
00:25:28,76 --> 00:25:34,87
She never fitted in with the family she had terrible psychological problems

162
00:25:34,87 --> 00:25:44,14
but the interesting thing about it is that she's outlived the whole lot of them except Nicky Butt

163
00:25:44,91 --> 00:25:50,56
and then after that of course was Kate. Who was worse and so.

164
00:25:50,58 --> 00:26:00,71
But she cared about her so she brushed sometimes she just found sitting around the house just brushing her hair.

165
00:26:00,73 --> 00:26:07,88
And she too was a great reader were always begging for books we never had unless. There are now.

166
00:26:07,9 --> 00:26:10,38
And caves wasn't a great reader.

167
00:26:10,8 --> 00:26:15,62
She was more of a sports person she always won the races at school

168
00:26:15,62 --> 00:26:25,8
or was highly intelligent she what she was very good at dictation. If we couldn't.

169
00:26:26,00 --> 00:26:32,29
Couldn't reach for the dictionary would shout. How do you spell so and so you know.

170
00:26:32,84 --> 00:26:37,98
How do you spell this how do you spell that but use awful awful at math.

171
00:26:39,02 --> 00:26:46,64
You know there was an exam one day and she got everyone have a semester off and then of course it was me

172
00:26:48,41 --> 00:26:59,81
and youngest sister Marie who was ten months old. And they were. This is terrific really terrific family.

173
00:26:59,99 --> 00:27:03,51
I can look back on it now and see the good things.

174
00:27:04,15 --> 00:27:09,85
Certainly there were times as a child when I wished that we have a piano

175
00:27:11,03 --> 00:27:21,23
and a violin which you could never have afforded but lets her it was but we had all of this wonderful companionship

176
00:27:22,00 --> 00:27:27,51
and to quite an extent everyone looking after each other.

177
00:27:27,52 --> 00:27:42,2
Did you have a favorite sibling when you were a girl oh yes that you know big families do tend to pair off. And.

178
00:27:43,01 --> 00:27:49,66
It's true to say that Walter and Kate were the three of us were might.

179
00:27:49,67 --> 00:28:03,94
And we were very close didn't have a favorite didn't. Well John like to saw he feel that role magnificently is a far.

180
00:28:03,95 --> 00:28:12,94
And he took over all the cooking from my mother. And my mother wasn't much of a cook. You know.

181
00:28:12,95 --> 00:28:17,91
She just couldn't be bothered to choose or rather sit around the place and so.

182
00:28:17,93 --> 00:28:25,25
But when John took over the cook all the shopping and the cooking. And we did he did the shopping by ballot.

183
00:28:25,46 --> 00:28:32,69
We had a head about it and it was always sort of what's the word you don't.

184
00:28:32,84 --> 00:28:48,72
Park about two more in the local creek and down into the. Paddle right in the valley and they have more the boat again.

185
00:28:49,36 --> 00:28:57,22
At the local store fill it up with the bags of sugar and bags of flour. Well there were a lot to feed you.

186
00:28:59,29 --> 00:29:04,94
And take it back. I mean we didn't have to buy jam because that was made. A lot was made.

187
00:29:05,4 --> 00:29:13,95
Certainly but we needed fifty pounds of flour each time for the bread making. And so he do all of that take it.

188
00:29:14,97 --> 00:29:23,46
And do you know why. And he would go to the local slaughterhouse stated they knew.

189
00:29:23,48 --> 00:29:43,14
Instead of the butcher and he'd get the made for pittance. So wonderful or huge field with vegetables from.

190
00:29:44,2 --> 00:29:56,00
There because he'd always. Slip up. Today I haven't. And we had pie dishes that would feed this big family.

191
00:29:56,02 --> 00:30:08,56
They were huge. So he'd make. Rice custard Brydon that are custard on the top of the bread and butter custard.

192
00:30:08,58 --> 00:30:18,64
And then put them on the top and then when we'd have it he'd pull the cream just. Just.
