and very well can show up

10
00:00:59,83 --> 00:01:04,68
when i caught him most. But the splice
played between all the way down the cover

11
00:01:04,68 --> 00:01:10,33
plate you had to do that all the way through
why we had to read it. But it was and

12
00:01:10,33 --> 00:01:17,16
you say it wasn't it was built it. Yes it
was too harsh for fear of it left us and

14
00:01:24,85 --> 00:01:31,12
yet another section. We've put in and

15
00:01:34,19 --> 00:01:39,23
i'm afraid you are finished. First
you finish in work. You had to do

16
00:01:39,23 --> 00:01:45,19
a thing to to george.

17
00:01:46,52 --> 00:01:53,15

19
00:01:59,05 --> 00:02:05,91
any scale hot scale going on. Do you
prevent. Most of would not like you show

20
00:02:05,91 --> 00:02:11,49
us that your section here
was and we weren't on the

21
00:02:12,63 --> 00:02:18,59
nevers she was such an underneath. Just
gotta get tough on the outside. Oh i see

22
00:02:18,59 --> 00:02:22,82
someone i'm with you but if you get any
scale coming off the rivets i'm here. Oh

23
00:02:22,82 --> 00:02:28,85

it would drop on them.

26
00:02:44,60 --> 00:02:50,93
We had to be pretty cause they wouldn't get
in down in your boots as well. Ever. No

27
00:02:50,93 --> 00:02:56,75
never got to go near very much.
I think you get more doing

28
00:02:56,75 --> 00:03:02,07
a very clean workshop and the holder might
get more as well from the inside as well

29
00:03:02,07 --> 00:03:08,86
but need some time when you know he was
going to leave it here on and shows

30
00:03:09,87 --> 00:03:16,06
kneeling down. But he's rich. You need not
have to do is put even if you know i'm

31
00:03:18,07 --> 00:03:22,01
connected with ford. And had a rattler and

32
00:03:22,01 --> 00:03:27,33
a piece of pipe to hold it hold the machine
up on the other side that it held it up

33
00:03:27,33 --> 00:03:29,85
so machine. It just had

34
00:03:29,85 --> 00:03:36,36
a hole not machine and
i put it on not of it

35
00:03:37,20 --> 00:03:42,78
and pressure at the top card phone cord

36
00:03:45,48 --> 00:03:51,13
and down. Did you get it that the that
this didn't change just by piece to

37
00:03:51,13 --> 00:03:54,35
something like that it would
skate and i always had

38
00:03:54,35 --> 00:03:58,37
a stroke honest monish hope. On

39
00:03:58,38 --> 00:04:02,54
a piece of paper. So that it was up
against he had had at the pope should

40
00:04:02,54 --> 00:04:03,72
understand but

41
00:04:03,72 --> 00:04:09,90
a pope should fluff. Just
very wander and use the

42
00:04:09,90 --> 00:04:16,29
automatic passport as the pneumatic tubes
for the rivets the new did you start

43
00:04:16,29 --> 00:04:21,21

rivets sound from the from the cooker to

44
00:04:21,21 --> 00:04:27,73
the catcher. We have just dropped and don't
share. And on that you were on the top

45
00:04:27,73 --> 00:04:29,20
