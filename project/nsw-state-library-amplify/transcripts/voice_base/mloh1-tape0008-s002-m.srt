they are I live about thirty feet away from the site of dollars of the so it is just out the front door into the Java

52
00:06:05,32 --> 00:06:10,44

00:06:34,46 --> 00:06:41,5
So catches available in telling about circular Key goes to patronise some of them during the week

00:07:33,54 --> 00:07:41,62
and the main racecourses power Randwick Rosehill in Canterbury was a bookie in the arbiter where you are working,

65
00:07:41,62 --> 00:07:43,65
it does point out well.

66
00:07:43,65 --> 00:07:51,3
Learn that the only one that I knew I was so towards the latter part of the job relevant nineteen thirty one,

67
00:07:51,3 --> 00:07:53,45
when no one of the foreman used to.

68
00:07:53,45 --> 00:07:54,35

00:08:21,53 --> 00:08:28,32
It was search of the Hillary Newton, hinder here is my friend goes on the months as point side

00:08:28,7 --> 00:08:34,83
and before he became a foreman who via who has a concrete mixer driver at terminal six.

74
00:08:34,83 --> 00:08:38,33
Four about four failure for authority is an error.

75
00:08:38,33 --> 00:08:42,98
The other from an unknown adult points I deserve a middle-aged man

or more overland literary Lindy at the track Chloe at the time of my employment in the dollars.

77
00:08:52,52 --> 00:09:01,12
Two you are very popular from here believes in getting fed modern fair days work out of the workers.

78
00:09:01,12 --> 00:09:06,69
I think this has bit on London's object to that over,

79
00:09:06,69 --> 00:09:14,84
now across that fitted the online has given that the stonemasons are again on your view,

80
00:09:14,84 --> 00:09:23,83
but a number of their names unless you see your I can remove the stone motions they are more or less forever.

81
00:09:23,83 --> 00:09:30,72
Therefore, of a period that I was there so I became familiar with and Larissa Angus Cruickshank,

82
00:09:30,72 --> 00:09:34,03
the young Scotsman also Tom like,

crime under her reserve also pipe major Sydney Highland Society banned for many years in Sydney also another man.

84
00:09:45,49 --> 00:09:46,51
No Mister Dunlop.

85
00:09:46,51 --> 00:09:48,5
I just can't figure this first name

86
00:09:49,00 --> 00:10:02,08
and also were to project Baxter under Jack was an interesting culture the pro from one hundred

87
00:10:02,08 --> 00:10:12,61
and bar that these faces of course each other labourer under John Baxter is so labour was so named David Baxter,

88
00:10:12,61 --> 00:10:17,35
a young fella but no relation to him and learn

89
00:10:18,47 --> 00:10:28,41
and her were the documents name was to release under also Scotsman under a very fearless so how died

90
00:10:28,41 --> 00:10:37,53
when he wants to study dust stonemasons gains that our dog on a labourer understand that yesterday over the reserve.

91
00:10:37,53 --> 00:10:38,4
The two people,

92
00:10:38,4 --> 00:10:47,22
assisting the stonemason Caesar did block sustainability large Monday to fiercely blocks of stone locals have two holes

93
00:10:47,22 --> 00:10:56,12
brought into the top of on an angle under the dip and eighty paraphernalia was called hard chained dogs

94
00:10:56,12 --> 00:11:05,16
and these same first two p put into the into these are holes and under London analysts owned

95
00:11:05,16 --> 00:11:17,00
and that was hooked onto value of look of the claim under the stones are listed in the developing the fashion you were

96
00:11:17,00 --> 00:11:26,02
given time in incidence earn about term Doctor Bradfield yes yes numbers are living in dollars.

97
00:11:26,02 --> 00:11:30,88
Oh George should not sometimes of hours of this called in those days.

98
00:11:30,88 --> 00:11:40,06
I remember one solitary morning I was working at the intersection of the following George Street under that attractive

99
00:11:40,06 --> 00:11:48,2
to turn round of the key under Doctor Butterfield happened to be at home with a rating is the term that morning

100
00:11:48,58 --> 00:11:53,98
and under the logo on the term layer to stop is fair for me to world is going,

101
00:11:53,98 --> 00:11:57,4
which was only about two minutes walk anyway,

102
00:11:57,4 --> 00:12:05,69
but the adductor blood filled produced his gold the interview did eBay fear of the owner didn't pro from me.

103
00:12:05,69 --> 00:12:05,99
Oh,

104
00:12:05,99 --> 00:12:14,2
and under the new myth that well Joe you hear he gargling elbows near the theatre that that's collected afloat the prototype

105
00:12:14,2 --> 00:12:19,86
and some gold in the conduct of the doctor clutches are go apart which is very good.

106
00:12:19,86 --> 00:12:31,37
I felt that it is just that some of your own doctor, Brazil, says to come down the offer of a Saturday morning he was

107
00:12:31,37 --> 00:12:40,51
or is on his own organisation to hear sector used to access the Mornington sentiment Bogarde ducked the doctor are used

108
00:12:40,51 --> 00:12:44,66
to seeing going down there and it turned liquid over himself,

109
00:12:44,66 --> 00:12:51,64
but he was never accompanied by anybody says that adjusting the hard during the week because it would be accompanied by

110
00:12:51,64 --> 00:12:55,1
inspectors and live like that. He was to go to check up on things.

111
00:12:55,1 --> 00:12:57,61
Several people tell me arcs middle of the other side

112
00:12:57,61 --> 00:13:01,45
when they were pines give access to come down at six o'clock in the minds of the first,

113
00:13:01,45 --> 00:13:09,84
the first poor if rely what are you on about skew broach. I was in the first one of dollars.

114
00:13:09,84 --> 00:13:17,4
On the south-eastern side under of course it's a massive reinforced steel in there as well

115
00:13:17,71 --> 00:13:22,62
and the concrete was a special mixture of cause it to.

116
00:13:22,62 --> 00:13:32,7
I remember it was completely dark and we heard the lamps her to enable us to see what we were packing high up.

117
00:13:32,7 --> 00:13:39,75
This is one of the learn the bearings concreting in the bearings in a decision single, poor to that.

118
00:13:39,75 --> 00:13:46,65
Yes, it was a single pool it, but as I say it is a tremendous amount of the reinforcement steel in it

119
00:13:46,65 --> 00:13:56,05
and no video her if because of a very awkward to get the become critically in in and around in every corner

120
00:13:56,05 --> 00:14:05,18
and technical training. but Of course it was done under or so earlier we hinder low and electric light.

121
00:14:05,18 --> 00:14:13,12
I am Leeds high see you were inside the bearing packing with concrete from the inside your earth wonderfully in Soho to

122
00:14:13,12 --> 00:14:16,7
live so I understand now you're packing back in the concrete)

123
00:14:16,7 --> 00:14:26,94
deep underneath the berry to make sure it is lit eight run right inside the BST will contain heart placed this is a

124
00:14:26,94 --> 00:14:29,45
more incidents like that your number about it and of

125
00:14:29,45 --> 00:14:37,28
and awkward places we had packed concrete her year you refer all we were awkward places under that concern the main

126
00:14:37,28 --> 00:14:44,11
floor as it was called witches ( hundred and fifty figure someone nearer was in fact level

127
00:14:44,35 --> 00:14:54,00
and the are the bands instructs on that very awkward and I can remember I was sent down as an private,

128
00:14:54,00 --> 00:15:00,39
I think I can say that I was the home.

129
00:15:00,39 --> 00:15:07,51
I think I can say without further application posted just telling the story looked I was looked upon with the gun

130
00:15:07,51 --> 00:15:17,69
packer well begun as you know is sometimes referred to in sharing is so profound so my dear gun shearer relentlessly

131
00:15:17,69 --> 00:15:21,64
person would do more or less the lesser post

132
00:15:21,64 --> 00:15:28,7
and hard evidence over two I do so without further are reluctant to think

133
00:15:28,7 --> 00:15:32,73
and I can number being sent down in one of these beams

134
00:15:32,83 --> 00:15:44,25
and the fighting BDO product from the amount was about the movement of the displacement would be about six seats

135
00:15:44,25 --> 00:15:55,91
greater under part about ten feet to a mouse also of room for Pope concrete reinforced the steel rods under our actual

136
00:15:55,91 --> 00:16:05,28
number had great difficulty difficulty getting down between the the or how to go because the computer is being more

137
00:16:05,28 --> 00:16:14,21
or less drawn down on top of me and I'm I was equipped with firm as are our seals confirm the unknown skin.

138
00:16:14,21 --> 00:16:16,2
None hirsute

139
00:16:16,2 --> 00:16:24,56
and also I remember the parrot have so Wester on my head to work future stock from the road being pulled the local me

140
00:16:24,56 --> 00:16:26,63
but that was one of the most awkward jobs.

141
00:16:26,63 --> 00:16:35,72
I have the fitness to little late, they are I know I got a load of the singer correctly because and

142
00:16:35,72 --> 00:16:44,03
when it was stripped of the snow at the call of bony earth stuff you know everything out of the could smooth finish

143
00:16:44,14 --> 00:16:50,29
hunting people realised today exactly what there went into the year the packing of concrete in those days for the

144
00:16:50,29 --> 00:16:52,61
hernia vibration in our system.

145
00:16:52,61 --> 00:16:57,22
It is more of a matter of routine, as long as the mixture is right of the child while it was over

146
00:16:57,22 --> 00:17:03,99
and as you can see it was all done by hand under it to work with this backing tool,

147
00:17:03,99 --> 00:17:09,97
which had a blade of about four inches and know it in no words

148
00:17:09,97 --> 00:17:17,07
and it was all have to be done laboratory by home tell media.

149
00:17:17,07 --> 00:17:25,67
Do you have a history with a concrete mixing games at all I only had done our own about the collection.

150
00:17:25,67 --> 00:17:26,32
I had with them.

151
00:17:26,32 --> 00:17:30,42
Yes, I neural of across personally and by name and I

152
00:17:30,42 --> 00:17:35,2
when we got up to a certain heart on the pylons of the telephone installed

153
00:17:35,2 --> 00:17:44,92
and we used to render window of manifesto became became a fairly good estimate of how much concrete would be needed in

154
00:17:44,92 --> 00:17:46,56
such and such a place

155
00:17:46,56 --> 00:17:55,53
and O2 ran down to the to the mix to video mixer driver until it how much rent would require very required.

156
00:17:55,53 --> 00:18:03,93
This is when we were mostly finishing off the job tuna member the size of the mixes were in those days.

157
00:18:03,93 --> 00:18:12,87
Her were the concrete mixers were all near a rollover of our ruler are now.

158
00:18:12,87 --> 00:18:20,35
I just can't tell you the exact lie understand that there were one cubic yard machines will reluctantly)

159
00:18:20,35 --> 00:18:25,16
would be reluctantly regard because a registrant Australia's of the bucket skip

160
00:18:25,16 --> 00:18:30,62
but back although stuttering I do remember now that it had held two yards.

161
00:18:30,62 --> 00:18:35,21
So they would mix one yard at a time and enough foreign one, and lectured

162
00:18:35,21 --> 00:18:41,14
and put it into the skip in the trainer would holiday but would be correct at an incredible.

163
00:18:41,14 --> 00:18:45,06
In other the size of those of those pylons, the amount of concrete

164
00:18:45,06 --> 00:18:51,26
and all mixed in one cubic yard machines fed by hand incredible that would be right years earlier,

165
00:18:51,26 --> 00:19:00,54
mechanically concrete trade would be one out at a time and because it was only via metal or aggregate usage

166
00:19:00,54 --> 00:19:08,16
and that a map concrete was a costly broken stuff from the room till me how you were employed from nineteen twenty

167
00:19:08,16 --> 00:19:14,71
seventh nineteen thirty two and you'll were constantly employed on packing concrete

168
00:19:15,05 --> 00:19:20,8
and yes I would say that I was constantly from on one side as well so there will be another

169
00:19:20,8 --> 00:19:30,52
and again is whether a concrete gangs tour altogether are no longer on nineteen twenty nine are a mate of mine below

170
00:19:30,52 --> 00:19:36,93
move the blowpipe Charlie Charlie Thomas was/ no digger from the first floor.

171
00:19:36,93 --> 00:19:45,9
He was my co- packer and then from nineteen twenty nine on we went over to Wilson 's point

172
00:19:45,9 --> 00:19:56,18
and Charlie alone did most of the packing is that how many gangs whether therefore owner of the packing concrete.

173
00:19:56,18 --> 00:19:59,19
I will they would be one else is wrong message.

174
00:19:59,19 --> 00:20:07,19
Side and were the printer or a home in anything well who are of a mechanic concrete on the ground.

175
00:20:07,19 --> 00:20:09,27
The estimates of driver.

176
00:20:09,27 --> 00:20:14,12
The two men are filling rickshaws with blue metal are not blue metal

177
00:20:14,12 --> 00:20:20,49
but malaria mental than those one-man filling rickshaw with sand

178
00:20:20,49 --> 00:20:29,57
and has an additional man to cater for the name of petty crime his job only was to put the cement in who lived in the

179
00:20:29,57 --> 00:20:39,01
study for a limited time at cloud Dawes point for many years and who is a very humorous man who was Australian,

180
00:20:39,01 --> 00:20:47,67
an Irish Australian and here talus minimally stories and emphatic at local Court on stories about that is,

181
00:20:47,67 --> 00:20:53,17
those were workloads in the hip hip.

182
00:20:53,17 --> 00:21:05,2
He was a coat of the study are to our artillery will follow the story about a amount to live a story of the roundabouts

183
00:21:05,2 --> 00:21:10,29
of roundabout September nineteen twenty seven. I took the day off.

184
00:21:10,29 --> 00:21:13,16
I asked foreman Mister simpler for a day or from lucid,

185
00:21:13,16 --> 00:21:22,63
yes we wanted for us on a return boot recession in connection with the second of study Mark notice in America so in the

186
00:21:22,63 --> 00:21:24,97
game, information and

187
00:21:24,97 --> 00:21:35,73
but I think I was one of the twenty five thousand men had much through Sydney streets that die from the domain down

188
00:21:35,73 --> 00:21:44,55
Martin Place of George Street, and we finished up in Belmont Park, but never our station have up till then it out.

189
00:21:44,55 --> 00:21:53,68
I understand this was the biggest demonstration in Sydney and will also in nineteen twenty seven,

190
00:21:53,68 --> 00:22:00,05
the return of the story about tonight back on that a lot of people I know about second Vanzetti

191
00:22:00,05 --> 00:22:08,96
or to what this is about their birth saccharin rooms only richer Italian columnists who were wrongfully convicted in

192
00:22:08,96 --> 00:22:17,49
America, power, there was great to outcry all over the world about time these people around.

193
00:22:17,49 --> 00:22:19,36
Of course it so well known.

194
00:22:19,36 --> 00:22:28,63
Now they were trained under on charges of robbery bank robbery in America after they were to run militant commonness

195
00:22:28,63 --> 00:22:34,25
and for this reason they paid the penalty and as I say in Sydney

196
00:22:34,25 --> 00:22:42,67
but though there was a great demonstration among Mister frustration of workmen parading through the streets of Sydney

197
00:22:43,2 --> 00:22:53,16
you had another yarn as you can tell us about term hurled Irishman who is still good stories in her home.

198
00:22:53,16 --> 00:22:55,77
This is a chip the moment, Paddy crying.

199
00:22:55,77 --> 00:22:58,63
It was an Irish Australian under delivered,

200
00:22:58,63 --> 00:23:05,14
though not far from me at the door 's point during their four failures of those working there

201
00:23:05,14 --> 00:23:10,51
and here is a very humorous man tell a lot of stories Australian jokes

202
00:23:10,51 --> 00:23:16,18
and firm over as an injunction against aborigines, are quite a lot

203
00:23:16,18 --> 00:23:24,37
but don't wonder they are in a relevant nineteen twenty seven of them chap came under home two dollars.

204
00:23:24,37 --> 00:23:28,57
Side Burnley is very well dressed and unknown,

205
00:23:28,57 --> 00:23:36,77
it is limit amongst the workers of this must be an expert on the tunnels under at that time there will be cables are

206
00:23:36,77 --> 00:23:43,77
being threaded through the media tunnels to the whole rack Fiona Pender, however,

207
00:23:43,77 --> 00:23:52,72
the next day this are well dressed individual started work as a labourer and he proved to be an Englishman

208
00:23:52,72 --> 00:24:03,6
and done anyway here are so very well spoken and done here that we the Monday before the twenty period.

209
00:24:03,6 --> 00:24:10,17
The day before burned very will just put to did look as though my bill over British riders

210
00:24:10,29 --> 00:24:16,59
and learn anyway here he was given a job are working hard.

211
00:24:16,59 --> 00:24:25,28
I will follow on the radio on the envelope behind a concrete mixer under his job was to travel in some of the metal

212
00:24:25,28 --> 00:24:27,27
that was used for the concrete

213
00:24:27,29 --> 00:24:36,99
and anyway the sporadic trying his job was only two within the cement into into their own sales

214
00:24:36,99 --> 00:24:43,26
and make the concrete mixer that's all it have to do and, of course, in those days,

215
00:24:43,26 --> 00:24:52,86
so the cement was seven was parcelled up in no jute bags and it was a very dusty job under very dirty joke to factor.

216
00:24:52,86 --> 00:25:03,52
However, the Sir Patrick for only under your job of keeping count of the amount of concrete was sent up and down here.

217
00:25:03,52 --> 00:25:12,55
I remember via the sermon harassing clever from an era said they like to live possible to set set a record of a hundred

218
00:25:12,55 --> 00:25:22,48
and fifty batches firm that match was how much our batch would be a two yards of concrete that is to mix is full.

219
00:25:22,48 --> 00:25:32,27
Yes, it would be two mixes for you suddenly ride and anyway the so petty crime, he kept the score window.

220
00:25:32,27 --> 00:25:40,6
He had litre with various unrelated to Bridge board with holes in it under EU two years a match to tour the pudding

221
00:25:40,6 --> 00:25:44,94
media being that the number of batches that left McPherson

222
00:25:44,94 --> 00:25:54,1
and under his cunning fellow theories to keep the score actually about ten behind product was actually window

223
00:25:54,1 --> 00:26:00,05
and error in the Sir Deyo media at matches, pointing at a hundred and fifty under

224
00:26:00,05 --> 00:26:08,74
or pressure to recruit from the accountant and a can of Israel are closer to rural splendour no absolutely.

225
00:26:08,74 --> 00:26:12,74
He whosoever firm score of one hundred and fifty move.

226
00:26:12,74 --> 00:26:20,49
He said the hundred and fifty bloody both survey Linda Pattison nurse tried to show the hundred

227
00:26:20,49 --> 00:26:32,75
and fifty purchase under the Count said the home worth more bloody money. He said Linda Addy said the already said.

228
00:26:32,75 --> 00:26:41,77
It's not so much the money is the owner and under the counter said the bloody honour is a merger of likeness

229
00:26:42,17 --> 00:26:50,89
and Paddy said to Rowley said Cos it is not so much the on the money said, as there is with Fiona

230
00:26:50,89 --> 00:26:53,56
when you're writing to your paroled mother in England,

231
00:26:53,56 --> 00:27:00,65
he said your mail to tell her the friend in Australia you knocked up a biggest school with a shovel

232
00:27:00,65 --> 00:27:10,55
and Jack Hobbs did with his bat you think you do this to me get this straight about the concrete mixing teams are a

233
00:27:10,55 --> 00:27:11,8
better researching.

234
00:27:11,8 --> 00:27:15,56
I would understand that they would be numbers of concrete mixing teams

235
00:27:15,56 --> 00:27:22,87
and numbers of the list of concrete teams packing that you say that there was only one team, he sighed.

236
00:27:22,87 --> 00:27:26,66
Yes, upset and Senator one teammates RBF.

237
00:27:26,66 --> 00:27:33,5
There are the that the men were placed in the position under that was a first, actress

238
00:27:33,5 --> 00:27:42,4
or are unemployed was placing his men in intelligently that each mounts into earn a narrow PMO is exactly what was

239
00:27:42,4 --> 00:27:43,92
required of England,

240
00:27:43,92 --> 00:27:51,83
a jock proceeded quite smoothly should we go over that again exactly what each each mandate first can you explain

241
00:27:51,83 --> 00:27:54,34
exactly what is mandate of the concrete mixer.

242
00:27:54,34 --> 00:28:06,44
Yes there were two men Philip filling these barrows which bananas the vendor first to enter the two men filling lose a

243
00:28:06,44 --> 00:28:14,91
number of one man filling a rickshaw with sand under as a restricted to the China leader of a hopper of the concrete

244
00:28:14,91 --> 00:28:19,41
mixer the limit and that this other man called Paddy kind heated,

245
00:28:19,41 --> 00:28:29,07
he kept the required amount of cement into the harmony is that so far relate would be heard to on the middle one on the

246
00:28:29,07 --> 00:28:33,04
sound one on me and cement and also to Mexico

247
00:28:33,85 --> 00:28:41,87
and the women of the year the cement went up top harmony in your going up the Arab versus another chap

248
00:28:41,87 --> 00:28:50,33
and myself that arm but there was out at the firm place of the either at the placement from a concrete.

249
00:28:50,33 --> 00:29:00,28
There is also a document and he had a whistle and he made signals to the cone drivers are spotting boring,

250
00:29:00,28 --> 00:29:09,7
so there was one Mexico and you to that built the whole of the pylon on the south side, plus a bit on the north side.

251
00:29:09,7 --> 00:29:18,77
That's true you so that was to two teams of men literally build those gigantic pylons I would say that is correct to

252
00:29:19,11 --> 00:29:23,37
that actually incredible. I was under the impression that there were dozens teams all over the place.

253
00:29:23,37 --> 00:29:29,15
It seems to me to be absolutely incredible and REM actually receive your

254
00:29:29,79 --> 00:29:33,82
when I first started in twenty seven Larousse three concrete papers

255
00:29:33,82 --> 00:29:40,5
but term runabout throughout nineteen twenty eight should say so there was only another chap myself

256
00:29:40,66 --> 00:29:48,11
and causes corresponding are going movements is put inside and ran into an multiplied side

257
00:29:48,11 --> 00:29:50,15
and one concrete in their world.

258
00:29:50,15 --> 00:29:54,19
In nineteen twenty nine earlier as you know Leo

259
00:29:54,19 --> 00:30:04,77
and for the city side order of sprint side of the pilot was well advanced and the Braeside rivers are well behind Sara,

260
00:30:04,77 --> 00:30:12,36
along with a known Charlie my other made my mode with malicious damage and virtually to know,

261
00:30:12,36 --> 00:30:20,58
is the actual use properly was left Thomas her record and blowpipe Charlie and them. He was my mate.

262
00:30:20,58 --> 00:30:27,25
They are right structure of the entire passing under that extra 's and Nelsons.

263
00:30:27,25 --> 00:30:33,83
Two as well because lived to come backwards and forwards are on the lunch and hence under Vista,

264
00:30:33,83 --> 00:30:46,11
early Archana Bridge sometime as not many people could look at those pylons of the I felt that the view you scroll the

265
00:30:46,11 --> 00:30:52,26
thing was really are. I think we traverse an amount applied in a work undone.

266
00:30:52,26 --> 00:30:54,4
We made sure that everything

267
00:30:54,4 --> 00:31:06,00
and leaves timber was taken away stripping them removed everything looked her gritting finished in fiscal matters does

268
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:11,57
something is utterly amazing to me to think whether arm of any other young women.

269
00:31:11,57 --> 00:31:18,95
It is one other thing we'll on the packing of the concrete down into the tunnels for the cable 's in the cable tunnels,

270
00:31:18,95 --> 00:31:20,37
yes there are so down.

271
00:31:20,37 --> 00:31:27,93
Learn the talents also and across the erosion of its period out of solid block

272
00:31:27,93 --> 00:31:32,5
and Justin King explain the that the cable tunnels under the purpose of

273
00:31:32,5 --> 00:31:37,81
and the actual building of them from scratch that will actually be nineteen twenty seven,

274
00:31:37,81 --> 00:31:45,28
the tunnels had just about that now become excavated and I didn't have any part of that,

275
00:31:45,28 --> 00:31:55,68
but I did homerun her work down now under the Carpenters are six carpenters employed across on on the DOS.

276
00:31:55,68 --> 00:32:06,95
Side her right throughout the failures that I was there to further the tunnels were line refer corrugated iron under

277
00:32:06,95 --> 00:32:14,61
like on the SCUBA and the rules fixed of course in place by the Carpenters and across all work.

278
00:32:14,61 --> 00:32:24,84
We don caused by electric loan to value could well imagine under that though once one C Alderson curved earning

279
00:32:24,85 --> 00:32:30,76
corrugated iron was put in place that it was also backed up by concrete

280
00:32:30,76 --> 00:32:34,89
and oh yes I did a lot of that went down as well.

281
00:32:34,89 --> 00:32:42,14
How did you get in to pack behind the in the corrugated art in those tunnels are of whole will you see her.

282
00:32:42,14 --> 00:32:49,71
It is only the concrete was only lifted up and say height so large and depths,

283
00:32:49,71 --> 00:33:00,62
but I should say of four to five feet so leave her that would be left that payout lift of say five feet would be a

284
00:33:00,62 --> 00:33:07,86
fraud that would be left on an hourly, carpenters would turn put up moron corrugated iron

285
00:33:07,86 --> 00:33:11,67
and so forth up to the top of the top up to the top of the plan

286
00:33:11,93 --> 00:33:17,81
and set would follow the concrete up on that one is it there is just explained to me,

287
00:33:17,81 --> 00:33:22,74
something which I find difficult to comprehend. You explained.

288
00:33:22,74 --> 00:33:28,65
First, these the cement mixing team which is a team of five are on this.

289
00:33:28,65 --> 00:33:39,06
Two of your packing so that soon seven plus oh six carpenters servers as sex in the survey.

290
00:33:39,06 --> 00:33:47,29
Section as it S thirteen years of well I forgot to mention all so that when the concrete rivers forward

291
00:33:47,29 --> 00:33:55,67
and reverse scrip are to be pushed along the river crank repeated that also two logos employed pushing the skip along,

292
00:33:55,67 --> 00:34:00,05
but so that would make another two workers employed actually employed on

293
00:34:00,05 --> 00:34:08,87
or that including carbon is a sunny fifteen to perform the people who will build the formwork mixed concrete put it

294
00:34:08,87 --> 00:34:15,03
around and finally painted on the whole of the other pylons is fifteen aside according to what you sent it as well.

295
00:34:15,03 --> 00:34:24,71
In addition to that, there would be three men are bending and placing no reinforced bar.

296
00:34:24,71 --> 00:34:31,54
I still only eighteen thirty eighteen men are sided are building the violence in this plus there is the year of the

297
00:34:31,54 --> 00:34:39,75
stonemasons had how many of those are relevant to one stonemason on each pilot and he had a logo

298
00:34:39,75 --> 00:34:45,81
and also a document so that three aside so that sixty six further men.

299
00:34:45,81 --> 00:34:52,53
They are so that takes into twenty four to twenty four men, including this stonemasons built those pylons right up,

300
00:34:52,53 --> 00:35:00,74
including the further carpet is the stonemasons concreting gangsters are what I would think that would be a first class

301
00:35:00,74 --> 00:35:08,3
in particular was twenty four managed so this is forty eight for the two cold rolled from river would be other firm

302
00:35:08,3 --> 00:35:19,82
labourers employed from time to time under no no each person who do a lot of tales judging their about all return to

303
00:35:19,82 --> 00:35:26,94
the much more note on the predominantly more and employed until they are under your problems were to be washed down

304
00:35:28,47 --> 00:35:34,73
and am about to late nineteen twenty one to early thirties, as it is incredible to me.

305
00:35:34,73 --> 00:35:39,06
I can they certainly got their money/ treatment they were yes I think so,

306
00:35:39,06 --> 00:35:44,85
use the cross with Doctor height money undercutting after fifty feet

307
00:35:44,85 --> 00:35:53,02
and noted increased quota quota deal under human thought your money was are available.

308
00:35:53,02 --> 00:36:00,05
Roll the think the most money I ever got reserve run about thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars included that of over

309
00:36:00,05 --> 00:36:06,06
the term at the same time after about fourteen pounder.

310
00:36:06,06 --> 00:36:10,8
None of the main people train drivers you know only receive fourteen pounds ten

311
00:36:11,04 --> 00:36:19,18
and of course can concurred with that term bridging no New York to help Cambridge Sir Sydney got the Sydney Harbour

312
00:36:19,18 --> 00:36:26,14
Bridge built very cheaply because some figures under and the boilermakers

313
00:36:26,14 --> 00:36:32,14
and no on the New York Bridge were getting at the equivalent of sixteen pounds and nine.

314
00:36:32,14 --> 00:36:40,43
Australian money will overhear constantly value the young rate was about nine pounds.

315
00:36:40,43 --> 00:36:47,56
It seems to me you that that there were very few men involved in actually liberal in the Bridge.

316
00:36:47,56 --> 00:36:55,08
The way I have read it arm is about a hundred and fifty people about were building the arch and if it's as you say,

317
00:36:55,08 --> 00:37:01,97
which must be that the pylons were built by about another fifty people that only two hundred building the whole of the

318
00:37:01,97 --> 00:37:08,09
bridge and pylons and the rest of the employees were involved. Therefore, in the fabrication.

319
00:37:08,09 --> 00:37:08,69
The workshops

320
00:37:08,69 --> 00:37:17,99
and the quarry earlier here of several bureaux eyed under most figures about the amendment to the employed immediately

321
00:37:17,99 --> 00:37:25,55
around the country admits in England who are only rare about another one that was so rare mansion unnumbered Bouverie

322
00:37:25,55 --> 00:37:28,11
on the child.

323
00:37:28,11 --> 00:37:34,09
We will be known as indictment but you didn't leave the ground and that was one of them was occupied

324
00:37:34,09 --> 00:37:42,74
and omitted Leo was jailed dealer under England sought staking under Saudi media Granite is derived from malaria

325
00:37:42,87 --> 00:37:44,25
and bury another man.

326
00:37:44,25 --> 00:37:55,25
I think that going that would mean it would be fifty two test at the twenty six aside here are highly I will think that

327
00:37:55,25 --> 00:38:03,49
rebuke will be much see your recover your carpet the price that's tough that's very,

328
00:38:03,49 --> 00:38:09,07
very much less than I thought I had never never occurred to me they would be as little as that.

329
00:38:09,07 --> 00:38:09,36
Yes,

330
00:38:09,36 --> 00:38:16,24
I think that the looking back on some of the papers that I have her year that would be about the number of names that

331
00:38:16,24 --> 00:38:25,46
would do the coding of our people will be employed because that I have someone told papers here that the trip to from

332
00:38:25,46 --> 00:38:33,69
nineteen twenty nine and on during that time and similar as soon her own timber workers strike

333
00:38:33,69 --> 00:38:39,7
and also Newcastle crosses, see our coalminers were on strike and twenty nine

334
00:38:39,7 --> 00:38:48,99
and wish to take up the levies for there to assist these people are out on strike Lyndon and oh,

335
00:38:48,99 --> 00:38:54,32
I still have some focus of the names of the men that you are dilated under.

336
00:38:54,32 --> 00:38:58,7
I think that would be a roundabout the total number of people

337
00:38:58,7 --> 00:39:06,66
and that I can remember collecting money out for the strikers what exactly is until to do with as papers,

338
00:39:06,66 --> 00:39:15,85
even in the union all I will either of the kept her in the house, a term like some of my rather tattered

339
00:39:15,85 --> 00:39:24,44
and under faded now because the term of the distiller still in the drawn well I'll am saying is that I think it's

340
00:39:24,44 --> 00:39:29,43
important that they get preserved or at least competent but into into some format in the Mitchell library

341
00:39:29,43 --> 00:39:35,57
or call with your union assemble Uni library. Yes, I think I still have them, and in the draw.

342
00:39:35,57 --> 00:39:45,47
They are not have to make sure I'm still pinching the home puzzled about in that year the figure still have a think

343
00:39:45,47 --> 00:39:50,08
about much Mister Jack McKay on one of the very,

344
00:39:50,08 --> 00:39:57,5
very few men who built those gigantic islands of the Sydney Harbour Bridge given a member of the inspection of the

345
00:39:57,5 --> 00:40:02,43
registered member, who did the job and and how was her views known.

346
00:40:02,43 --> 00:40:11,18
I can remember Leo, one of the inspectors so infected. He was an engineer matter. Mister Butler and chest.

347
00:40:11,18 --> 00:40:18,51
He was Public Works resident engineer for the year for the substructure are years ago who he was in attendance at a

348
00:40:18,51 --> 00:40:27,27
fair bit of the time that of crossing under another man under him were who was there with us all the time window.

349
00:40:27,27 --> 00:40:34,21
He saw that this is the stuff was placed in and the mixture was a bit of a year.

350
00:40:34,7 --> 00:40:42,83
Up the quality under all that serving written his name was Mister Bill Anderson is a the year immediately under the one

351
00:40:42,83 --> 00:40:45,97
that was in immediate term,

352
00:40:45,97 --> 00:40:54,83
her vicinity of over the two of us all the time to deal have two order to their ever order that the concrete,

353
00:40:54,83 --> 00:41:02,81
be removed from being run consistency and no, not that I can recall I think everything was up, up to a specification

354
00:41:03,78 --> 00:41:11,43
and its effect was there all the time you seen stricter said yes that C and Rio were– trying to think of inspector.

355
00:41:11,43 --> 00:41:16,8
Yet he was there all the time is that different from any other job, even on.

356
00:41:16,8 --> 00:41:25,2
I will use the notes on city buildings had been employed on in other days of the Snowdonia inspector there that I can

357
00:41:25,2 --> 00:41:25,59
remember

358
00:41:25,59 --> 00:41:34,00
or clerk of works are I don't remember going on some of the big jobs lead that have a cloak works her Richter have any

359
00:41:34,00 --> 00:41:42,26
work that guided must never supervise their exit by the perhaps the contractors for modern all-round panic

360
00:41:42,26 --> 00:41:43,28
and cross over.

361
00:41:43,28 --> 00:41:52,83
Have you did you ever see a bad mix is a concrete on the city were at yes I have done that are not seen no where cement

362
00:41:52,83 --> 00:42:06,68
was home to correct amount of cement wasn't put into the mixture. Never or you can think of her new home home.

363
00:42:06,68 --> 00:42:19,43
The most recent roses firm the cane keynote factory to Fairmont in Sydney. It was badly next the cement was well.

364
00:42:19,43 --> 00:42:28,87
I remember seeing some of the mixer under who it was so skimped on our lesson admission of it.

365
00:42:28,87 --> 00:42:36,4
It is far less meant that I think should have been well thank you Ginsburg

366
00:42:36,4 --> 00:42:42,96
and will you tell us about the years disputes between the builders labourers

367

though during margin to around the job already been going twelve months and I got the job are under.

371
00:43:08,04 --> 00:43:17,27
I was on for the last twelve months of its third towards its completion during that time the federal secretary of the

372
00:43:17,27 --> 00:43:22,26

374
00:43:31,57 --> 00:43:38,91
consideration was an amendment may repair system of. He was a militant and done.

375
00:43:38,91 --> 00:43:49,04
He had no hesitation in foreign anything about stopping the job of south Geelong and as another factor.

376

per week strike pay node man got a little more however Percy Smiths are to advise us of any bridge building in

380
00:44:23,64 --> 00:44:30,89
Australia after that would come under the jurisdiction of the builders labourers Federation in nineteen twenty seven,

381
00:44:30,89 --> 00:44:32,52
when I came to Sydney.

382
00:44:32,52 --> 00:44:36,48
I was already a financial member of the builders labourers union and

383
00:44:36,48 --> 00:44:45,67
when I presented this ticket to the AWT represented a representative of a tourist point at the Harbour Bridge.

384
00:44:45,67 --> 00:44:55,14
I was told us that it was no good that I'll have to join the oh W her at the moment at that moment I consider that I

385
00:44:55,14 --> 00:45:02,61
was entitled to work at the Harbour Bridge with this ticket that I had covering me as a bill of global that Lara.

386
00:45:02,61 --> 00:45:04,68
Oh, I was denied this,

387
00:45:04,68 --> 00:45:15,38
actually the representative of the KW that I was speaking to another showed the ticket to a after it became a great

388
00:45:15,38 --> 00:45:16,76
friend of mine,

389
00:45:16,76 --> 00:45:31,04
but at the moment he was inclined to two that are heard to pick a fight with me are because I initially objected to

390
00:45:31,04 --> 00:45:35,06
during the O. W.

391
00:45:35,06 --> 00:45:41,22
They were little as about the relief work in that the passion of Jill builder were on the building of the Reg and yes,

00:45:41,22 --> 00:45:49,33
Mister yes sir, I will tell you about Theo relentlessly just a straight out safe

393
00:45:49,33 --> 00:45:53,4

Origin no later annunciation suburbs under and about nineteen twenty oh thirty four by I.

00:46:28,1 --> 00:46:37,13
I was one of several other people who were offered to reach worker in every five weeks

400
00:46:37,13 --> 00:46:44,29
and that this averaged out of twenty seven and six p per week and I was very distant.

401
00:46:44,29 --> 00:46:50,84
This was just abstract of this work are relief work was served to got two weeks of every five that whisperer are a
