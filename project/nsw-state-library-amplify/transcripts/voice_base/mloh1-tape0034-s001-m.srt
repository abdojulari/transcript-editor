1
00:00:01,01 --> 00:00:03,15
I'm talking to mr.

2
00:00:03,15 --> 00:00:08,24
Burke who was the charge hand marker often
the bridge workshops sydney harbour

3
00:00:08,24 --> 00:00:12,77
bridge where luna park stands. Do you
remember first getting the job. Them's the

4
00:00:12,77 --> 00:00:18,78
pain. Yes i happened to be one of the first
of the markers are employed there. And

5
00:00:19,90 --> 00:00:26,24
as the staff grew in numbers. I was invited
to become the charge can and from then

6
00:00:26,24 --> 00:00:31,76
on until the completion of the marking off.
I had charge of all the marking off on

7
00:00:31,76 --> 00:00:36,16
the main span work. The large angles

8
00:00:36,16 --> 00:00:42,28
a huge play. The gusset plates in which
every hole. Had to be marked in its proper

9
00:00:42,28 --> 00:00:48,19
position before the material were sent to
the big drilling machines and then from

10
00:00:48,19 --> 00:00:53,23
the drilling machines to the publication
shop where the anglers in the place were

11
00:00:53,23 --> 00:00:58,61
bolted together. Finally river did and send
out on the site. Do you mean. Where you

12
00:00:58,61 --> 00:01:03,97
got your instructions from your drawings
from now what. Where did you get your

13
00:01:03,97 --> 00:01:08,69
drawings from from the
door my long gone along as

14
00:01:08,69 --> 00:01:14,54
a draftsman and we had some very good
template makers to who helped us with.

15
00:01:16,16 --> 00:01:18,89
Wooden templates in which the majority as

16
00:01:18,89 --> 00:01:24,99
a whole which were marked for the big ngos
and so on. We saw the bridge going from

17
00:01:24,99 --> 00:01:29,73
day to day. What was the main
part of what you actually did

18
00:01:32,00 --> 00:01:38,35
. Well as the men working for me marked
the hole in the various angles and

19
00:01:38,35 --> 00:01:44,68
plates. It was my responsibility
to check them. Check every hole

20
00:01:44,68 --> 00:01:51,07
that they marked before the angler some
place were sent to the drillers and i can

21
00:01:51,07 --> 00:01:57,35
virtually cross the bridge today and
suggests that i've had my ruler on every one

22
00:01:57,35 --> 00:02:03,18
of the holes that those rivets fill up.
That's an incredible achievement i reckon.

23
00:02:03,20 --> 00:02:08,17
Considering the accuracy as well. Everybody
from the from the riveters on on up the

24
00:02:08,17 --> 00:02:15,12
line says how remarkably accurate every
every rivet hole was. Yes or that so and

25
00:02:15,12 --> 00:02:20,90
of course there wasn't anything particularly
exciting about that was plane down to

26
00:02:20,90 --> 00:02:27,53
business and making sure that everything
was correct and if you want to know why an

27
00:02:27,53 --> 00:02:29,48
experience i've had which was probably

28
00:02:29,48 --> 00:02:34,97
a culminating experience
of my work i was invited

29
00:02:37,95 --> 00:02:40,64
to go across to the harbor in

30
00:02:40,64 --> 00:02:47,48
a ship. You know about and
go up on the crane. To

31
00:02:47,48 --> 00:02:54,20
the top of the chords. That
day before they were joined i

32
00:02:54,20 --> 00:02:59,87
had the privilege of standing with one foot
on the north spain and one foot on the

33
00:02:59,87 --> 00:03:02,89
right spot and with about an
inch an hour half in between and

34
00:03:03,73 --> 00:03:08,98
a day or so before they were lit up. That
was my most exciting despair and the

35
00:03:08,98 --> 00:03:14,70
other was playing down to work. Did you.
Do you have any trouble while you were

36
00:03:14,70 --> 00:03:19,82
turning these large plates in the
shops. No it was a matter of having

37
00:03:19,82 --> 00:03:21,30
a very careful check in

38
00:03:21,30 --> 00:03:27,59
a case neared fire and our two there did
go on wrong or something and the careful

39
00:03:27,59 --> 00:03:33,66
checking pointed this out and or bracing
for may before the place went to the drill

40
00:03:33,66 --> 00:03:40,39
now had those plates been wrong where
they had holes running along the cord

41
00:03:41,37 --> 00:03:47,21
up to the diagonals up to the verticals
had anything happen to those plates. They

42
00:03:47,21 --> 00:03:52,50
were irreplaceable in australia at the
time it would have meant that had been

43
00:03:52,50 --> 00:03:58,97
rolled again and england and send out
and remarked so the. The importance

44
00:03:58,97 --> 00:04:05,01
of making sure everyone of those holes
were correctly mark speaks for itself.

45
00:04:06,50 --> 00:04:10,68
Were there any ones out that had to be
dumped where they're not to my knowledge.

46
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:17,39
Nothing at all and end talking to some
of the men who worked on. The riveting.

47
00:04:18,73 --> 00:04:22,64
They said that we quote we mark result did

48
00:04:22,64 --> 00:04:24,95
a good job because i didn't have to re ima

49
00:04:24,95 --> 00:04:30,03
a whole. Yes it's true. Is everybody says
that but i just came across one bloke was

50
00:04:30,03 --> 00:04:32,08
on the night shift. Who said that on

51
00:04:32,08 --> 00:04:37,29
a couple of occasions they had to dump
stuff in the harbor later on and. I don't

52
00:04:37,29 --> 00:04:42,64
remember that i know nothing about but i
can't speak about it or i don't know as i

53
00:04:42,64 --> 00:04:48,13
know anything was bought it was not used.
There was nothing done avert it. Can you

54
00:04:48,13 --> 00:04:53,21
remember the layout of the workshops.
When you were working there. Yes. When i

55
00:04:53,21 --> 00:05:00,02
commence out it was almost
like coke floor. And

56
00:05:00,02 --> 00:05:06,47
there were some huge logs. Going
along the length of the shop

57
00:05:06,47 --> 00:05:13,38
and it was only the blocks were made for
the ngo's to rest to be marked off.

58
00:05:13,47 --> 00:05:14,20
It was

59
00:05:14,20 --> 00:05:20,72
a dirty really fraud because as we
tramped up and down the length of the

60
00:05:20,72 --> 00:05:27,39
chords than the length of the
angles. So the ash was accumulating

61
00:05:27,39 --> 00:05:33,46
nambour allowed the dust first flying up
and it wasn't ordered over and of course

62
00:05:33,46 --> 00:05:40,44
the dogs were impregnated
with something to keep the

63
00:05:40,44 --> 00:05:43,75
why don't say what creosote
or something and that had

64
00:05:43,75 --> 00:05:49,56
a horrible smell to that was early on of
course. Do you member the other working

65
00:05:49,56 --> 00:05:51,68
conditions that you have any time off for

66
00:05:52,41 --> 00:05:56,29
a smoker or anything like
that. Now of course we're in

67
00:05:56,29 --> 00:06:02,01
a day when member expected to work eight
hours and do eight hours work not like

68
00:06:02,01 --> 00:06:06,55
they do now where they'll get time off for
morning tea and afternoon to we had no

69
00:06:06,55 --> 00:06:11,91
morning and afternoon tea permissable
but i think some of them found out

70
00:06:11,91 --> 00:06:13,75
a way to stick around somewhere and have

71
00:06:13,75 --> 00:06:20,52
a cup of tea. Yes i heard various stories.
Yes particularly young apprentices

72
00:06:20,52 --> 00:06:24,81
do you remember anything they used to
get up to. Well one of them said to me

73
00:06:24,81 --> 00:06:25,51
a few weeks

74
00:06:25,51 --> 00:06:30,82
a diary said all you ever did to me was to
to say get there but our out of it. And

75
00:06:31,75 --> 00:06:34,09
he's ours probably

76
00:06:34,09 --> 00:06:38,24
a nuisance to you and i said you probably
make some of the grey hairs that i've got

77
00:06:39,30 --> 00:06:44,64
. Some of the stories about crown and anchor
boards in learn share it all sorts of

78
00:06:44,64 --> 00:06:49,95
things like they do everything levitt
now i can't really i was particularly

79
00:06:49,95 --> 00:06:54,57
friendly with one young english fellow
there and we frequently had our lunch

80
00:06:54,57 --> 00:07:01,33
together and discussed other things
and. Bridges and boats and not so

81
00:07:02,29 --> 00:07:07,18
at that time to our studying advertising
and commerce allowed in which people would

82
00:07:07,18 --> 00:07:13,58
finally finish my working career and
so we had other things to talk about.

83
00:07:14,04 --> 00:07:20,68
Humor his name. Do you as frank tinker as
he did. Now is here and you know i didn't

84
00:07:20,68 --> 00:07:26,73
see him at the commemorative luncheon
whether he's still in sydney or not i don't

85
00:07:26,73 --> 00:07:29,14
know. I can't see as name on

86
00:07:29,14 --> 00:07:34,02
a near the list anyway. Do you remember
also when i was talking about the layout of

87
00:07:34,02 --> 00:07:39,76
the workshops you member how. The steel
came in and how it moved down the shops can

88
00:07:39,76 --> 00:07:46,09
you describe the shops to me. Yes. Outside
of the shop proper. There was the war

89
00:07:46,09 --> 00:07:52,54
where all those big steel girders
and anglos were unloaded.

90
00:07:53,97 --> 00:08:00,80
And they count round on far east mostly
into the shop and then lifted up by

91
00:08:00,80 --> 00:08:06,51
the travelling cranes and put into the
positions we wanted them for marking the

92
00:08:06,51 --> 00:08:12,53
whole journey of the plate mangels and the
planing machines. Remember the planning

93
00:08:12,53 --> 00:08:19,42
a machine and this friend of mine
fronting he worked the planning

94
00:08:19,43 --> 00:08:20,04
machine

95
00:08:20,04 --> 00:08:26,83
a very huge. Plane and it's
in their material up to my

96
00:08:27,74 --> 00:08:30,78
level joints and all that
sort of thing. Doing with

97
00:08:30,78 --> 00:08:35,51
a guillotine. Yes the guillotine was
quite near where we had our marking off

98
00:08:35,51 --> 00:08:37,13
benches and we heard

99
00:08:37,13 --> 00:08:43,02
a roar about coming down every say or had
an up boat place to their outlets and

100
00:08:43,02 --> 00:08:49,99
stars. That pretty noisy. Yes they
were the guillotine was very noisy

101
00:08:51,11 --> 00:08:55,64
understand some of the plates were two and
two were two inches thick silicon steel

102
00:08:55,64 --> 00:09:02,26
. Yes yes i know these places are said
before. Helen from england and i don't think

103
00:09:02,26 --> 00:09:07,51
they were able to be manufactured in australia
so that was all the more reason why

104
00:09:07,51 --> 00:09:14,42
we had to be very particular in marking
the holes. For the various spirit as it

105
00:09:14,42 --> 00:09:20,03
were attached to them. Did you ever get
taken out on site of perth and the time

106
00:09:20,03 --> 00:09:25,80
when you enter the joining of the urge. No
never. Where did you live at that time.

107
00:09:25,81 --> 00:09:31,09
How did you get to work. I was living it
right by that time and used to come in

108
00:09:31,09 --> 00:09:37,38
from rose by to cars street
walker acquire street and pick up

109
00:09:37,38 --> 00:09:42,82
a launch for took us however to the north
side to the workshops and that's fairly

110
00:09:42,82 --> 00:09:48,34
handy. Do you remember more on the working
conditions what was it like when it was

111
00:09:48,34 --> 00:09:48,89
a when there was

112
00:09:48,89 --> 00:09:55,87
a southerly down by the workers very
very cold. We. We mostly had overalls on

113
00:09:55,87 --> 00:10:01,50
and we wore hats. Most of the time because
that research cold and we made sure we

114
00:10:01,50 --> 00:10:07,63
had good winter underwear when we were
through the winters was anything to keep you

115
00:10:07,63 --> 00:10:14,62
on their differ from work. No not was
impermissible anyhow i think some of our

116
00:10:14,62 --> 00:10:17,11
fellows managed to be or up

117
00:10:17,11 --> 00:10:22,93
a little or her prior were suddenly here
and they'll do you remember any accidents

118
00:10:22,93 --> 00:10:27,30
well you will let you remember any
accidents in the workshops will be

119
00:10:42,07 --> 00:10:42,07
.
