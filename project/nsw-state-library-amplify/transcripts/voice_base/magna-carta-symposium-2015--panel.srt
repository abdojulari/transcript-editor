1
00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:04,22
For what I propose we do is that we have been with Rosemary

2
00:00:04,22 --> 00:00:14,57
and on going down to them once each panel speaker has a chance to say anything further pump as I mentioned,

3
00:00:14,57 --> 00:00:25,57
we am proceed to questions and discussion. After we finish at three o'clock potential to save it.

4
00:00:25,57 --> 00:00:36,35
I think the papers today demonstrate what a wonderful tapestry when asked that are interweaving of so many ideas

5
00:00:36,35 --> 00:00:44,37
and inspiration to many developments that shape our society the centuries

6
00:00:44,81 --> 00:00:53,87
and today I contributions of all these fine gentlemen on the panel

7
00:00:53,87 --> 00:01:08,44
and am very grateful to have been asked of the discipline to the hat that up to one years I've certainly will modify

8
00:01:12,77 --> 00:01:45,3
the maybe just to a that in the broker I spoke to someone about civics education.

9
00:01:45,3 --> 00:01:53,05
She is involved in occasion and she referred to the work I've done in the program,

10
00:01:53,05 --> 00:02:02,2
called the discovering democracy is under the Howard government which ended up with materials being circulated to all

11
00:02:02,2 --> 00:02:03,16
schools

12
00:02:03,98 --> 00:02:13,84
and the result of that relates to a comment that to David made about the absence of constitutional history in the

13
00:02:13,84 --> 00:02:21,13
schools I would say is wide and that its political and constitutional history,

14
00:02:21,13 --> 00:02:29,24
we have a lot of material in the books and activities we circulated

15
00:02:29,24 --> 00:02:35,56
and which was designed in her fairly accessible way to talk about traditional arrangements

16
00:02:35,56 --> 00:02:44,64
and have about our political history that it was those sections that the teachers were not interested in what they are

17
00:02:44,64 --> 00:02:53,5
interested in cheaply is encouraging students to be disciplined soon in the political process which is which is fine

18
00:02:53,93 --> 00:03:01,11
and they would get up a petition to get a skateboard park. For instance, there are no approach the Council on this.

19
00:03:01,11 --> 00:03:06,73
This is good, they would learn that it is the council you asking, not the Prime Minister and so on,

20
00:03:06,73 --> 00:03:17,44
so it it's her a valuable to do, but what I would ask teachers why why aren't you doing this other stuff.

21
00:03:17,44 --> 00:03:22,76
Now they say they are too boring, and if students need to know it.

22
00:03:22,76 --> 00:03:30,79
They'll find out later and I would say you know you teach quadratics equations you teach profit

23
00:03:30,79 --> 00:03:38,52
and loss you teach that the periodic table, you do all those things, but you won't explain to the students

24
00:03:38,52 --> 00:03:45,18
or have them learn the each state since the same number of Senators to Canberra,

25
00:03:45,18 --> 00:03:51,99
but for the House of Representatives you send numbers according to the population to be stated to pretty fundamental

26
00:03:51,99 --> 00:03:53,68
aspect of our Constitution

27
00:03:53,68 --> 00:04:04,79
and relevant to the business of being voters so I think there is a long way to go the before we can say that there is a

28
00:04:04,79 --> 00:04:14,21
good civics education program in the school and its partner nothing because for so long.

29
00:04:14,21 --> 00:04:15,88
Nothing has been done so now

30
00:04:15,88 --> 00:04:25,61
when talking about a generation of teachers who don't know this stuff if we were here years ago, teachers

31
00:04:25,61 --> 00:04:31,25
and students would all know some British Constitutional history year they would know Magna Carta

32
00:04:31,25 --> 00:04:35,94
and Charles the first losing his head and death in the glorious Revolution

33
00:04:35,94 --> 00:04:46,62
and so they have a sort of outline Rajesh Constitutional development, which explains why you still have a king

34
00:04:46,69 --> 00:04:53,58
or a Governor General, who is the only acts on advice, the Parliament

35
00:04:53,58 --> 00:04:59,26
or of ministers responsible department that elementary aspect system,

36
00:04:59,26 --> 00:05:06,77
you would have learnt through British history that doesn't happen so nothing happens so that's a rather despairing

37
00:05:06,77 --> 00:05:17,87
comment on this glorious occasion they have actually given me something to comment about a comment is this led to we

38
00:05:17,87 --> 00:05:21,29
have a course in high schools school legal studies

39
00:05:21,94 --> 00:05:30,47
and legal studies teachers are very proactive in including a lot of civics education

40
00:05:30,47 --> 00:05:39,66
and those sorts of matters under the heading of legal studies and that there are a very young, well motivated,

41
00:05:39,66 --> 00:05:42,91
energetic bunch of teachers and they have an annual conference,

42
00:05:42,91 --> 00:05:45,3
which I would rest for the last eight years in the business

43
00:05:45,66 --> 00:05:49,22
and which brings about two hundred of these people into the one room

44
00:05:49,22 --> 00:06:03,21
and the exchanges are fantastic so as not all bad news at a hole under the Parliamentary edging patient website have a

45
00:06:03,21 --> 00:06:13,09
wealth of material arm and more boys, including historical material so you can find you a short history of Parliament.

46
00:06:13,09 --> 00:06:18,96
For example, on the PO website and they are currently life the anniversary this year,

47
00:06:18,96 --> 00:06:30,22
developing materials on Carter 's ratification dwellers range of other so I don't know that there is the general course

48
00:06:30,22 --> 00:06:31,55
to disband one eleven.

49
00:06:31,55 --> 00:06:40,81
There are gatherings like this and groups of people promoting civics education

50
00:06:40,81 --> 00:06:52,06
and proper education for our school student in the life remains on the stated discontinuance education theme.

51
00:06:52,06 --> 00:06:53,24
I think with video link.

52
00:06:53,24 --> 00:07:03,17
Further income some reasonably educated in relation to the town clerk to John mentioned are Rosemary 's uncomfortably

53
00:07:03,17 --> 00:07:10,79
close to the Parliamentary precinct is certainly within the Parliamentary trials on looking at you are and an arm.

54
00:07:10,79 --> 00:07:19,19
It may be, in fact the responsibility of the Museum of Australian democracy, I don't know the harm my strongest he was.

55
00:07:19,19 --> 00:07:26,49
It is just wrong and end arm. It is fundamentally misconceived. What extraordinary place.

56
00:07:26,49 --> 00:07:32,08
This was in the early days of colony are now in a couple of respects and in I mention cable

57
00:07:32,08 --> 00:07:38,15
and Sinclair in government quarry appointing ex-convict snarling ladies were shaken their heads in light of both as

58
00:07:38,15 --> 00:07:40,57
someone already regain arm.

59
00:07:40,57 --> 00:07:47,76
Clinically safe and have follows through a thing to really when you think about it harm that case

60
00:07:47,76 --> 00:07:56,57
and you know the superstructure that was put in place by Sydney to give the possibility of emerging that that was armed

61
00:07:57,26 --> 00:08:03,33
right at the forefront of of our you have fallen more in governments

62
00:08:03,33 --> 00:08:14,52
and continually instantly knocking you referring David of unit two, so Mum and initiatives here around the boat

63
00:08:14,52 --> 00:08:21,93
and all sort of thing. It's a very, very sought a proud record of leading the world and one thing respect.

64
00:08:21,93 --> 00:08:25,08
We were leaving and the English-speaking world.

65
00:08:26,01 --> 00:08:29,61
From the third month settlement is,

66
00:08:29,61 --> 00:08:38,92
and that with great respect is not reflected in a far as you have started to go wrong.

67
00:08:38,92 --> 00:08:46,36
The second step is the something less like the look, the Senator Senator Senate has a wonderful budget

68
00:08:46,37 --> 00:08:58,52
and you just point out that my readers very unpopular in government circles at the time because he refused to permit

69
00:08:58,52 --> 00:09:09,72
any separate funds to be deployed to fund the monument in Mac based on the basis that Parliament had appropriated funds

70
00:09:09,72 --> 00:09:17,11
to the Senate Department for the purpose of supporting centres and that this was a purpose not mention by will.

71
00:09:17,11 --> 00:09:19,43
It is a question without notice.

72
00:09:19,43 --> 00:09:21,2
Rosemary you following the precedent

73
00:09:21,2 --> 00:09:34,2
or not to use them at they are guards take one substantive" is in my paper I actually talk about which we tend to

74
00:09:34,2 --> 00:09:41,67
remain carrying him glowing terms all the wonderful things in the result of back out from the eighteen forties through

75
00:09:41,67 --> 00:09:46,88
the nineteen fifty was used between Catholics and Protestants letter writers

76
00:09:46,88 --> 00:09:53,35
and newspapers in this country argue about the car, because as we heard the neck

77
00:09:53,35 --> 00:09:55,76
and England was Catholic country fish

78
00:09:55,76 --> 00:10:04,18
and sundry are Catholics in Australia said well actually it with the Catholics who brought liberty to Australia because

79
00:10:04,18 --> 00:10:09,34
of Langton with a Catholic unpromising controversialist course would having any of this.

80
00:10:09,34 --> 00:10:14,37
They point out the first of all, the Pope did another of the capital antifreedom

81
00:10:14,37 --> 00:10:22,59
and then they try re- badge Langton has Freeborn Englishman are her own English patriot he was visiting interference

82
00:10:22,59 --> 00:10:30,07
elsewhere so that another side to them even car that story, it isn't always about the wonderful things.

83
00:10:30,07 --> 00:10:35,44
It is principally about that, but there are other components to other another couple of things to say.

84
00:10:35,44 --> 00:10:39,35
I think our pendulum know more about this and I didn't.

85
00:10:39,35 --> 00:10:46,4
I understand that the first government was famous for proclaiming that will be noticeably green/ this is a time

86
00:10:46,4 --> 00:10:49,52
and slavery still exist to the British Empire.

87
00:10:49,52 --> 00:10:57,66
That's another in important component of freedom you can buy and sell human beings are in this country

88
00:10:57,66 --> 00:10:58,59
and the other the other.

89
00:10:58,59 --> 00:11:04,54
Another major innovation just to give you another example in the eighteen fifties Australian colonies came up with the

90
00:11:04,54 --> 00:11:07,47
idea of the other sumo government in talks

91
00:11:07,47 --> 00:11:15,86
and contract under claims against the government are legislation out with another ninety years until such Crown

92
00:11:15,86 --> 00:11:19,33
proceedings were available in England,

93
00:11:19,33 --> 00:11:24,47
to underline the point that several people have made that the transmission of ideas.

94
00:11:24,47 --> 00:11:35,61
Yes, we get a lot of ideas involve institutional investor one-way traffic or thank you am any questions. Any comments.

95
00:11:35,61 --> 00:12:17,82
Yes you will a year will only two bit like believing in the tooth fairy and

96
00:12:17,82 --> 00:12:25,31
when we discover what it is very really is a it's over, I think gives us either.

97
00:12:25,31 --> 00:12:38,47
I think it's gets the idea is that of the gum associated with this document or documents with this event arm,

98
00:12:38,47 --> 00:12:48,58
whether those ideas are accurate is another matter that there become associated with them has become a method it if it

99
00:12:48,58 --> 00:12:50,04
is a legend

100
00:12:50,63 --> 00:13:00,65
and make lots of elections people become very emotionally attached to live in is not absolutely rigourously intellectually

101
00:13:00,65 --> 00:13:06,42
attached to say I think. It's exactly right. On the other thing.

102
00:13:06,76 --> 00:13:13,91
At least this nothing wrong with at all mean age degeneration you know owns and runs the place.

103
00:13:13,91 --> 00:13:20,62
Lisa say it to the schoolkids from my lecturers becoming am always at places like you that were twelve -year-old in

104
00:13:20,62 --> 00:13:21,84
five years time.

105
00:13:21,84 --> 00:13:26,25
All sixties time you will be bugging reset after that you were running the show,

106
00:13:26,25 --> 00:13:32,97
I mean each generation sees things in their own way and and and one thing about Magna Carta,

107
00:13:32,97 --> 00:13:41,24
whether understood promptly and understood properly by people and experts debate all sides.

108
00:13:41,24 --> 00:13:51,08
What I think means anyway so you debate has many views that are all in a way valid attached to am if Magna Carta is

109
00:13:51,08 --> 00:13:58,21
seen to symbolise good things and I think it does not never that anybody say that Magna Carta symbolises bad

110
00:13:58,98 --> 00:14:06,46
or things that are against the public interest always associated with an good government and have the rule of law

111
00:14:06,7 --> 00:14:08,51
and isolate people seem likely,

112
00:14:08,51 --> 00:14:28,73
just fantastic cultural icon that almost irrespective of words in ten have attracted all of those with the best about

113
00:14:29,82 --> 00:14:48,38
major phrases like and to us they are that the other way and you go the whole year,

114
00:14:48,38 --> 00:14:59,18
that track your beautiful illuminated those rich colours and it just blows just cultural residents.

115
00:14:59,18 --> 00:15:11,08
I think it of much level is I think the other young horses… a very simple compelling story teller to children because

116
00:15:12,13 --> 00:15:21,7
what nation they have here we may start very thing you very powerful.

117
00:15:21,7 --> 00:15:23,78
They gave you of King

118
00:15:23,78 --> 00:15:34,81
and Queen being always subject to buy some ministers that something quite if you start with a simple notion of a human

119
00:15:34,81 --> 00:15:35,78
being.

120
00:15:35,78 --> 00:15:47,72
and Then you have a story of people being able to hold the key to what that means in law at the fact that it is over to

121
00:15:47,72 --> 00:15:52,88
within weeks doesn't take away from that dramatic,

122
00:15:52,88 --> 00:16:07,69
so I think is very telling the people of all understand David to say this, I mention before about the elements,

123
00:16:07,69 --> 00:16:08,79
the rule of law on this.

124
00:16:08,79 --> 00:16:16,3
It is institutional arrangements is also some mentality which is nice behind the constants concept example of

125
00:16:16,3 --> 00:16:23,6
moderation in politics that though there are divisions will know between parties infections.

126
00:16:23,6 --> 00:16:29,77
It's all operates within a basic framework which we century except as requiring piece

127
00:16:29,95 --> 00:16:35,28
and has as a peaceful system was a church or said to two cheers for democracy,

128
00:16:35,28 --> 00:16:42,2
or whatever it is not perfect system is like any human contrivance it's created by humans are fallible creatures

129
00:16:42,2 --> 00:16:44,17
and so the sum of similar institutions,

130
00:16:44,17 --> 00:16:52,16
but we have moderation is an idea emerges in sixteen seventies in this course is very important to have disagreement

131
00:16:52,16 --> 00:16:56,6
without having a civil war, which is an enormous achievement historically

132
00:16:56,6 --> 00:17:04,11
and as I wrote it in my paper how to save now it's worth reflecting that we are doing today are clear.

133
00:17:04,11 --> 00:17:13,23
I manner about the achievement given that we have mastered like all the answers civil peace in this country as of other

134
00:17:13,23 --> 00:17:20,92
democracies and if you can on your television, you'll find other parts of the world with a simply have not done this.

135
00:17:20,92 --> 00:17:23,82
Now the at the achievement is enormous.

136
00:17:23,82 --> 00:17:34,09
It's true that the media last blower 's personality scandals all acts of stuff there may seem peacefully voting is a

137
00:17:34,09 --> 00:17:36,9
bit of a chore a bit boring,

138
00:17:36,9 --> 00:17:46,93
but it's an enormous civilisation achievement I think as with stress that we think you were first saw the white shirt

139
00:18:00,01 --> 00:18:28,78
you are in view of the zone as they are the fire is in the as you view as it is our earlier than usual only is there

140
00:18:28,9 --> 00:18:41,53
are all your life.

141
00:18:41,53 --> 00:18:54,04
The any responses well it's not just those two instances,

142
00:18:54,04 --> 00:19:01,59
there are many examples presumption of innocence being reversed about criminal Law where the onus is put on to the

143
00:19:01,59 --> 00:19:14,3
defendant to establish some matter of excuse and it's been a progressive process" a long period of time and firm.

144
00:19:14,3 --> 00:19:24,11
You one of the very obvious examples is where if you are found in possession of more than a certain quantity of a

145
00:19:24,11 --> 00:19:26,16
prohibited drug.

146
00:19:26,16 --> 00:19:34,9
The onus passes to you to prove that you did not have that drug in your possession for the purpose of supply,

147
00:19:34,9 --> 00:19:41,77
otherwise you will be convicted of supplying the drug even if you didn't supply to anyone and that is one example.

148
00:19:41,77 --> 00:19:48,35
There are other examples is no doubt that Parliament has the power to do this, but every time they do it.

149
00:19:48,35 --> 00:19:55,16
They go against the very well established principle with the presumption of innocence

150
00:19:55,16 --> 00:20:04,17
and the requirement from proof being form the party making the allegation so we see inroads into this in in small ways,

151
00:20:04,17 --> 00:20:12,57
and sometimes larger ways are on regret to say fairly constantly and while agencies in the community object.

152
00:20:12,57 --> 00:20:21,6
Every time this happens bar Association more Society Civil Liberties various other bodies academics are Parliament has

153
00:20:21,6 --> 00:20:23,79
the power to do it if they think their votes.

154
00:20:23,79 --> 00:20:25,78
It will go,

155
00:20:25,78 --> 00:20:35,24
but I think I have Professor subpoena prime offender in some of this arm moving moving surfboard from twelve fifteen

156
00:20:35,24 --> 00:20:42,75
thousand one one thousand my favourite auspices some Alexis Cockle

157
00:20:42,98 --> 00:20:51,36
and our democracy in America were wonderful two-volume work of almost a thousand pages if you read the Penguin edition

158
00:20:51,65 --> 00:21:00,7
EE goes speaking in terms of the United States in eight in the eighteen thirties town where he talks about all these

159
00:21:00,7 --> 00:21:08,81
apparent contradictions and you know how many many aspects of the tyranny of the majority which some degrees,

160
00:21:08,81 --> 00:21:12,18
what in our government that has a majority in the Parliament

161
00:21:12,18 --> 00:21:18,04
and is arguably doing winding in so overriding some of these principles,

162
00:21:18,04 --> 00:21:23,92
but there are a lot of things that are in fundamental conflict which Nagin never absolutely reconcile on why the other

163
00:21:23,92 --> 00:21:26,23
items are

164
00:21:26,23 --> 00:21:33,66
and you know it's interesting looking at his book democracy in America because in some ways these days are like Magna

165
00:21:33,66 --> 00:21:41,25
Carta and people seeing democracy in America, whatever they were seeing democracy ( balm, goldplated, W.

166
00:21:41,25 --> 00:21:48,5
Bush will quite a while or a normal quoted are now your recording walk later but that it is its,

167
00:21:48,5 --> 00:21:56,9
it's just very instructive in seeing how release them issues are constantly play against each other and an end.

168
00:21:56,9 --> 00:21:58,05
You know how the rule.

169
00:21:58,05 --> 00:22:05,69
The majority is often in conflict with all the ninth of the highest level writer on insulin as anyone else wish to

170
00:22:05,69 --> 00:22:16,49
comment on this question I shouldn't factor in anthropology officer either you about those particular policy changes,

171
00:22:16,49 --> 00:22:28,2
but some I do say that the fees are decisions made by our lawmakers in our system of representative democracy,

172
00:22:28,2 --> 00:22:33,04
we have elected people to confirm and make outdoors

173
00:22:33,04 --> 00:22:44,00
and wish we just hope that they will make more in the knowledge that what they are doing has a historical legal context,

174
00:22:44,00 --> 00:22:54,91
and done in that there are many reactions to such proposals to to limit apparently limit our right

175
00:22:54,91 --> 00:23:00,87
and one of the great vehicles for expressing those users through Parliamentary committees.

176
00:23:00,87 --> 00:23:08,58
We have great system Parliamentary committee throughout the country where people do have an opportunity to put their

177
00:23:08,58 --> 00:23:16,07
view on the record, and we also have some specialist committees around the various jurisdictions in Australia

178
00:23:16,07 --> 00:23:24,95
and overseas that have a particular role to you keep an eye out for these issues to keep an eye out for potential

179
00:23:24,95 --> 00:23:27,64
infringements of people 's rights and liberties

180
00:23:27,64 --> 00:23:34,81
and to draw them to the attention of the other lawmakers so that at least the decisions,

181
00:23:34,81 --> 00:23:43,19
even though we all know there may numbers for to pursue political agendas least of that material.

182
00:23:43,19 --> 00:23:51,33
They're available for the to educate and inform the lawmakers in every week sent for example,

183
00:23:51,33 --> 00:23:59,42
the little body called the scrutiny of bills that reports on every deal is considered by the Commonwealth Parliament

184
00:23:59,42 --> 00:24:09,7
against phenomena criteria when the VL measure after this, and if the committee feels that the built measure.

185
00:24:09,7 --> 00:24:20,28
Then hit it engages in correspondence with the status to seek at least explanation of why this policy are being

186
00:24:20,52 --> 00:24:23,06
followed half and

187
00:24:23,06 --> 00:24:34,88
and possibly education Amendment of the policy to bring back to the norms that we expect Indian democracy,

188
00:24:34,88 --> 00:24:39,83
I think one thing is very clear and that is at the end of the day and the Australian system,

189
00:24:39,83 --> 00:24:43,63
how he is the will of the majority of people

190
00:24:43,63 --> 00:24:50,91
and found John Hirst mentioned earlier by Mister Menzies can be business around them

191
00:24:51,19 --> 00:25:00,13
and declaring that in relation to one the Communist Party and so forth the end of the day that

192
00:25:00,13 --> 00:25:06,57
when some through through the Parliament one.

193
00:25:06,57 --> 00:25:14,05
Five High Court and then ultimately was resolved against what Menzies want to do in a referendum so again today.

194
00:25:14,05 --> 00:25:21,32
We've been everywhere else you ultimately am assuming someone prepared to put questions we can put a question to it

195
00:25:21,32 --> 00:25:25,13
comes back to ultimately a referendum question,

196
00:25:25,13 --> 00:25:31,28
and now that's resolved one wins a majority that the majority of states are so,

197
00:25:31,28 --> 00:25:38,14
so the people you are in excess of the ultimate say in a general way might be to general elections could be seen in

198
00:25:38,14 --> 00:25:44,31
similar terms, they should say that defective Menzies in a very bad light.

199
00:25:44,31 --> 00:25:49,8
Here he was very reluctant about having to reverse the onus of proof

200
00:25:50,09 --> 00:25:57,78
and his reason for doing so was otherwise the ACO agents have to give evidence publicly and soap,

201
00:25:57,78 --> 00:26:04,32
then they would purposes rationale in that case,

202
00:26:04,32 --> 00:26:11,7
speaking for looking at all the instances that are now being mentioned of onus of proof have been reversed.

203
00:26:11,7 --> 00:26:16,91
I was wrong to think and Nicholas can comment on this. Why why this is happening.

204
00:26:16,91 --> 00:26:26,54
I wondered if it is happening because the standards of guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

205
00:26:26,54 --> 00:26:30,55
We probably race that to such a high level.

206
00:26:30,55 --> 00:26:39,06
Some people are guilty and get off and is that the reason why Parliament has now moved the other way,

207
00:26:39,06 --> 00:26:49,54
said you have to prove your innocence group that wanted to know why you are wide

208
00:26:49,54 --> 00:26:54,48
and agreement move that more people are escaping me just deserts and used to be the case.

209
00:26:54,48 --> 00:27:01,74
In fact the figures haven't changed much decade here in terms of the percentage of people who go to a defendant trial

210
00:27:01,85 --> 00:27:08,38
who are acquitted remained pretty much the same level for a very very long time and

211
00:27:08,38 --> 00:27:12,09
and I think quite an acceptable level, citing work were doing alright.

212
00:27:12,09 --> 00:27:13,35
There might think,

213
00:27:13,35 --> 00:27:25,52
then the reason why the onus of proof is reversed in these cases is so that politicians being tough on crime as opposed

214
00:27:25,52 --> 00:27:33,95
to being smart on crime want to get the message across to those who are going to vote for them in the next election,

215
00:27:33,95 --> 00:27:39,41
which is all of them really interested with a few a few exceptions,

216
00:27:39,41 --> 00:27:47,66
perhaps all right a few exceptions are they think that those people are going to interpret this as a sign that they are

217
00:27:47,66 --> 00:27:52,76
being tough on crime and because they're being tough, therefore,

218
00:27:52,76 --> 00:27:57,45
the courts must be given the weapons with which to be tough

219
00:27:57,45 --> 00:28:07,59
and the devil take the the individual who is caught up in the process used to date a case we have another question.

220
00:28:07,59 --> 00:29:47,1
This area you will many say something union expense in the nineteen twenties many Minnesota proposes international

221
00:29:47,1 --> 00:29:56,17
Magna Carta day larger English-speaking countries that Australia was one in Australia actually embraces as it easier

222
00:29:56,17 --> 00:29:58,36
then in nineteen thirty nine.

223
00:29:58,36 --> 00:30:07,77
The movement sure worried to maybe about prone germinal neutral sentiment in America Centre at the Lincoln copy of the

224
00:30:07,77 --> 00:30:15,42
Magna Carta to the New York welfare party and there was actually at the most popular thing to be seen.

225
00:30:15,42 --> 00:30:20,53
There are, and when the war broke out was stuck on the other side of the Atlantic.

226
00:30:20,53 --> 00:30:30,07
So was taken Fort Knox for our safety are Magna Carta incidentally used to be spelt Magna Charter H which is

227
00:30:30,07 --> 00:30:37,62
when you do your research in both spellings category and I are okay,

228
00:30:37,62 --> 00:30:45,35
you are value ninety forty six the British Museum was changed to allow Magna Carta now to remain one more year in

229
00:30:45,35 --> 00:30:53,91
America in gratitude for the American assistance of the word charter chart of United Nations nine accidents chart of

230
00:30:53,91 --> 00:30:54,76
the Commonwealth.

231
00:30:54,76 --> 00:31:02,12
Not an accident charter of rights and responsibilities Victoria act two thousand seven not an accident.

232
00:31:02,12 --> 00:31:07,31
So the workers flowed into our language and other subtle ways and was designed.

233
00:31:07,31 --> 00:31:11,01
I just had this too many cars found in popular culture,

234
00:31:11,01 --> 00:31:18,26
so I was in my research I found all these references do a racehorse called Mehmet Carter in South Australia,

235
00:31:18,26 --> 00:31:23,57
Victoria nineteen twenties and thirties associate is a very live horse

236
00:31:23,57 --> 00:31:27,28
and it had the advantage of famously beating an Australian

237
00:31:27,28 --> 00:31:34,83
and Victorian political drongo as you know is one of the Macquarie dictionary derivations for the work you're a dumb

238
00:31:34,83 --> 00:31:39,89
person in Australia, which I think is a worker should be brought in the use.

239
00:31:39,89 --> 00:31:48,66
That's my opinion as driver being faced the fact that it is light was last lost last in every race

240
00:31:50,27 --> 00:31:58,62
and then in twenty thirteen out Jay-Z is beyond those other half produced at a record album called Magna Carta

241
00:31:58,62 --> 00:32:05,68
committee launched to the need when he went to see this Aaron are married cartilages out of Salisbury Cathedral

242
00:32:05,68 --> 00:32:12,75
and that she had their copy on display are: the Zelman cover, so it is clear

243
00:32:12,75 --> 00:32:18,74
and easily an initial high heavy rock group in the nineteen nineties Magna Carta.

244
00:32:18,74 --> 00:32:24,35
There are lots of barristers chambers around the Commonwealth will make the Carter outputs gone along way from a

245
00:32:24,35 --> 00:32:27,47
chartered twelve fifteen the names still around

246
00:32:27,47 --> 00:32:35,7
and even the word charter Helena Eleanor risen above in nineteen forty eight talking about the universal declaration of

247
00:32:35,7 --> 00:32:36,88
human rights,

248
00:32:36,88 --> 00:34:11,84
described it as a Magna Carta for the whole of mankind Pegasus question the back there as you get closer to home.

249
00:34:11,84 --> 00:34:13,88
You laugh at other harbour

250
00:34:13,88 --> 00:34:22,51
or she is going to issue there has been a debate for the last four years in England about me doing the Constitution at

251
00:34:22,51 --> 00:34:25,78
a conference last in London on the card I attended there

252
00:34:25,78 --> 00:34:34,7
and then pivot University College London who are writing a kind of home Internet survey to ask Britain's what things

253
00:34:34,7 --> 00:34:38,29
should go into a new Magna Carter, now that this is as it

254
00:34:38,59 --> 00:34:45,96
or not for the using is an occasion to stimulate an interest in constitutional matters that what shall say I don't

255
00:34:45,96 --> 00:35:06,15
really have a letter to your value as he has set its education years in I've been held to be too gloomy i.e.

256
00:35:06,15 --> 00:35:12,09
I think I am more gloomy because just the other day I met up again with the Kerry Jones,

257
00:35:12,09 --> 00:35:15,51
who ran the case for the Queen.

258
00:35:15,51 --> 00:35:22,34
We had a republican referendum that I was on the other side, as is often the case,

259
00:35:22,34 --> 00:35:32,84
you get to know the people on the other side and you like them better than the people on your side, so I linked to.

260
00:35:32,84 --> 00:35:39,79
I still speak to Kerry occasionally she has been running an outfit called the constitutional education fund

261
00:35:39,87 --> 00:35:48,25
and I'm a member and she was in despair and she follows this through the code,

262
00:35:48,25 --> 00:35:56,4
the Lowy Institute Poly about people 's attitude to democracy and recently I don't have the figures with me

263
00:35:56,4 --> 00:36:03,44
but there was a very high proportion of young people who were prepared to say that democracy is in a very poor system

264
00:36:03,44 --> 00:36:07,68
of government and some Knowles would be better.

265
00:36:07,68 --> 00:36:16,36
Perhaps they meant an improved the other indicator is the growing number of young people who do not enrolled,

266
00:36:16,36 --> 00:36:19,05
even though compulsion

267
00:36:19,05 --> 00:36:32,96
and do not does so she she thought that she was close to giving up because you thought of all the efforts they've done

268
00:36:33,06 --> 00:36:37,21
the poll figures get worse.

269
00:36:37,21 --> 00:36:45,29
Take because boating is not compulsory is only compulsory to have the name marked off what you do with a piece of paper

270
00:36:45,29 --> 00:38:07,58
then is entirely a matter for you. Yes question here is the right there are I don't disagree with your I would die.

271
00:38:07,58 --> 00:38:10,22
He was that I make Carter,

272
00:38:10,22 --> 00:38:22,95
as a kind of symbol of the ability of the chicks you want to Army what we want something to this.

273
00:38:22,95 --> 00:38:52,47
This is a compact, I will go to the one more quick question

274
00:38:52,47 --> 00:39:32,98
and then will have to finish right the VBAC Mister Marshall is a brief answers about the young I know my very brief

275
00:39:32,98 --> 00:39:35,69
answer is convex, I think astray.

276
00:39:35,69 --> 00:39:39,15
There can, by nineteen forty,

277
00:39:39,15 --> 00:39:46,13
still doubted its right to its claim to be a nation because all the world if they knew one thing about Australia was

278
00:39:46,13 --> 00:39:48,11
its low origins,

279
00:39:48,11 --> 00:39:56,37
so I think the success which the rest of the world to the British acknowledged was so important to Australia that that

280
00:39:56,37 --> 00:39:58,65
eclipsed everything else.

281
00:39:58,65 --> 00:40:03,73
and As you say there is a wonderful story of Australia as an experiment in political democracy

282
00:40:03,73 --> 00:40:14,72
and in social democracy is just got overwhelmed with that her that large in the eye was interested in the link between

283
00:40:14,72 --> 00:40:16,81
mega cardinal rule of law sizes.

284
00:40:16,81 --> 00:40:25,1
I do look at the speeches given in the Commonwealth Parliament in August nineteen fifteen cents after Anzac Day in

285
00:40:25,1 --> 00:40:29,05
which the rationale for Australia entering the war was given.

286
00:40:29,05 --> 00:40:37,84
Now the immediate exclamation was to assist a request by the British who asked by the King of the Belgians to resist

287
00:40:37,84 --> 00:40:41,48
invasion of their country by the Germans, but then the Prime Minister,

288
00:40:41,48 --> 00:40:46,18
the time went on to explain that we were there to defend some of our values,

289
00:40:46,18 --> 00:40:54,12
and he listed some of those in honour of the use of Froebel we refer to C and its a wonderful speech in your letter.

290
00:40:54,12 --> 00:41:01,98
Now, because it's on the Parliamentary website only talks about are the country being guided by night

291
00:41:02,39 --> 00:41:10,32
and a number of other things. So it's clear they knew in the mines that some of those mental now. Today were at stake.

292
00:41:11,2 --> 00:41:20,69
Rationalisation will know that a seventy believed in my view of about our Gallipoli is it's rather strange for the

293
00:41:20,69 --> 00:41:21,84
biggest Mister Lawson.

294
00:41:21,84 --> 00:41:22,13
This is

295
00:41:22,13 --> 00:41:30,81
when Australia somehow became a nation now in an emotional sense that might well be true legally as people on this

296
00:41:30,81 --> 00:41:36,55
panel no that's rubbish I me think about Federation nineteen oh one.

297
00:41:36,55 --> 00:41:45,87
Not a nation that silly as interesting looking over the term nationals perspectives in relation World War I letter.

298
00:41:45,87 --> 00:41:46,41
Many people.

299
00:41:46,41 --> 00:41:48,61
He will use part of the British Empire

300
00:41:48,61 --> 00:41:56,11
and there were many Australians in England who joined British Army fought as British officers are passive best-known SM

301
00:41:56,11 --> 00:41:58,76
Bruce became Prime Minister here after World War I.

302
00:41:58,76 --> 00:42:05,35
He was Australian fauna politically before is an officer that re- Shami so there was a sense that you will part of an

303
00:42:05,35 --> 00:42:09,87
empire in a way it but I think people understandably more on the other hand,

304
00:42:09,87 --> 00:42:16,65
there were some very influential people in Europe are a source as quite different and quite independent

305
00:42:16,65 --> 00:42:24,52
and not least the then French President George, also in his name was our hurdle after the Battle of Hamill,

306
00:42:24,52 --> 00:42:26,87
which was my ashes great victory.

307
00:42:26,87 --> 00:42:31,74
We use what later became Blitzkrieg for the first time that, also got up

308
00:42:31,74 --> 00:42:34,97
and addressed a great group of Australian soldiers

309
00:42:34,97 --> 00:42:42,6
and said the French people something the effect of the French people have not observe what you done with your own

310
00:42:42,6 --> 00:42:46,44
country and observe the development use.

311
00:42:46,44 --> 00:42:49,71
Been able to undertake in your own country so weak when

312
00:42:49,71 --> 00:42:55,41
when you came here we expect great things of you exactly gone on to astonish the whole blood bath.

313
00:42:55,41 --> 00:43:02,41
but What what struck me is very intriguing about that is that people like Bruce with thinking empire breaking his neck

314
00:43:02,41 --> 00:43:10,63
to get our Saint Kilda and go on laying lords and ladies on his left arm are the French President,

315
00:43:10,63 --> 00:43:17,01
no less have very fine sense of the nation that Australians are built,

316
00:43:17,01 --> 00:43:21,84
which was now being is not what is your the energy

317
00:43:21,84 --> 00:43:27,00
and essence of that play now been transferred through these young soldiers to the defence of France.

318
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:34,9
Sorry I get going on that topic, the ad that around the time of Federation, there was actually,

319
