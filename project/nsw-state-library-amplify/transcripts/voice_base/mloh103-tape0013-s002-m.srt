1
00:00:14,39 --> 00:00:19,88
Do you think. With the upbringing
of their children. You mean.

2
00:00:23,30 --> 00:00:26,56
Some of the kids quite nice but.

3
00:00:26,58 --> 00:00:30,55
A lot of them but it's probably
not just the people from here.

4
00:00:30,55 --> 00:00:31,99
I think it's a general trend everywhere.

5
00:00:32,08 --> 00:00:36,70
Kids have no respect for
anyone or anything anymore.

6
00:00:37,63 --> 00:00:39,64
That's my observations.

7
00:00:39,66 --> 00:00:46,21
But i don't think it's probably it just
doesn't relate to the people of nim

8
00:00:46,21 --> 00:00:51,36
and i think it relates
to them everywhere and.

9
00:00:51,38 --> 00:00:58,18
Your grandchildren. Some
of my grandchildren.

10
00:00:59,46 --> 00:01:04,57
Growing up here in nimbin at the
moment and i have a 16 year old and

11
00:01:04,57 --> 00:01:08,67
and then 11 year old.

12
00:01:08,69 --> 00:01:13,04
They don't even want to go
up the street they just

13
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:17,14
and my 4 year old grandson.

14
00:01:17,16 --> 00:01:23,97
If we're walking along the street we have
to go past the rainbow cafe he will sort

15
00:01:23,98 --> 00:01:27,08
of stand back and say do
we have to walk this way.

16
00:01:27,23 --> 00:01:32,87
Now you know that's my four year old so.

17
00:01:34,31 --> 00:01:37,79
What do you judge out of that.

18
00:01:37,81 --> 00:01:42,58
And buy out the other two grand kids don't
they get off their school bus i get a

19
00:01:42,58 --> 00:01:45,09
little to school they go
to school bus and go home.

20
00:01:45,25 --> 00:01:48,44
That's a fatherly they don't
hang the street at all.

21
00:01:48,50 --> 00:01:48,97
Don't want to

22
00:01:50,81 --> 00:01:57,72
and you have much experience with

23
00:01:57,72 --> 00:02:04,52
a drug problem. I i see a
lot of it happening around.

24
00:02:06,36 --> 00:02:09,28
With my job at the moment
we don't see a lot of it.

25
00:02:09,50 --> 00:02:15,25
We probably see a lot of evidence but
we don't just sort of. You know.

26
00:02:15,36 --> 00:02:19,08
See i don't come in
contact with a lot of it.

27
00:02:19,12 --> 00:02:25,77
My husband does he gets a little
bit disgusted at times with the

28
00:02:25,77 --> 00:02:30,46
needles lying around and whatever he
has to pick up that sort of thing

29
00:02:30,46 --> 00:02:34,20
and i don't know we're going to all
do that either been trying to do

30
00:02:34,20 --> 00:02:39,57
that for a couple of years
and hasn't happened. You.

31
00:02:39,96 --> 00:02:43,79
In your job.

32
00:02:45,13 --> 00:02:50,39
But yes i do you know i don't.

33
00:02:50,41 --> 00:02:54,04
I it we are the reason.

34
00:02:54,06 --> 00:03:00,12
I don't know whether it's because the people
who are into consuming alcohol look at

35
00:03:00,12 --> 00:03:05,15
nothing else to do with their time
but they they certainly wait for.

36
00:03:06,17 --> 00:03:09,96
For dole day and. And they sort of.

37
00:03:10,62 --> 00:03:14,84
They're off they face for the first couple
of days with under the influence of

38
00:03:14,84 --> 00:03:16,17
alcohol so.

39
00:03:16,18 --> 00:03:18,47
I mean it certainly has
its problems as well

40
00:03:21,46 --> 00:03:26,85
or you would have hoped.

41
00:03:27,56 --> 00:03:33,44
Well i see nimbin advancing in the next
couple of years now our sewage systems

42
00:03:33,44 --> 00:03:39,31
going through what they said their big
demand for for land and what have you.

43
00:03:39,31 --> 00:03:45,04
So i think that nimbin will
thrive particularly now.

44
00:03:45,06 --> 00:03:49,15
Hopefully well and so they will
live anywhere else but limit.

45
00:03:50,87 --> 00:03:52,82
It is very different.

46
00:03:57,42 --> 00:04:02,76
And it really no i've never lived. If
oscar. But my kids say ah you know.

47
00:04:02,88 --> 00:04:08,08
Yes it's it's so much different
to anywhere else. You know.

48
00:04:08,76 --> 00:04:15,50
But some good things some bad things i
think it's a good place for the kids to to

49
00:04:15,51 --> 00:04:16,66
be brought up and.

50
00:04:19,40 --> 00:04:27,25
What it's going to say.

51
00:04:27,26 --> 00:04:30,59
I was born at mall and lived at.

52
00:04:31,28 --> 00:04:37,78
A place they call blue no beer and
it's just through on the tween border.

53
00:04:37,79 --> 00:04:41,69
I went to school blue knob and.

54
00:04:41,71 --> 00:04:45,69
And i when i did to my
finished my primary schooling.

55
00:04:46,38 --> 00:04:52,62
I did three years in nimbin travel
each day to nimbin on the bus.

56
00:04:52,64 --> 00:04:57,72
And when i finished there i came
to nimbin and started work.

57
00:04:57,74 --> 00:05:04,96
And the been here ever since.

58
00:05:04,98 --> 00:05:09,89
A very very good. We we made our own fun.

59
00:05:11,46 --> 00:05:16,79
And played tennis weekends they
answered every night of the week and.

60
00:05:17,55 --> 00:05:21,11
In those days we didn't worry about
alcohol or meeting with them.

61
00:05:21,18 --> 00:05:26,23
We really had a good time i think probably
the kids of today are missing out on the

62
00:05:26,23 --> 00:05:31,29
types of good time to use to have you know
i'm not as interested in sport any more

63
00:05:31,29 --> 00:05:34,53
like we were and you know.

64
00:05:36,49 --> 00:05:39,79
I'd like to see them at sort of
take a swing back to that so

65
00:05:39,79 --> 00:05:44,81
that you get the kids do something
rather than hang around the streets.

66
00:05:44,83 --> 00:05:50,83
And you know vandalizing property
and all that sort of stuff.

67
00:05:51,87 --> 00:05:58,72
You know i don't i.

68
00:05:58,91 --> 00:06:04,88
I think they've tried. And heaps
of ways to. Try and sort the town.

69
00:06:07,63 --> 00:06:13,12
But it just doesn't
always work. Some kids.

70
00:06:14,90 --> 00:06:20,62
Just rebels you know they just don't
like to sort of think that you say

71
00:06:20,63 --> 00:06:22,18
or don't do that. They just don't.

72
00:06:22,31 --> 00:06:27,00
And then you know they just get
pleasure out of doing it. I believe.

73
00:06:28,04 --> 00:06:33,31
But i think that's general
turf not just name and.

74
00:06:33,33 --> 00:06:39,52
I'm an old fogey probably or you
know you know i get a bit disgusted

75
00:06:39,52 --> 00:06:43,58
when we never ever did those sort of
things i don't think they should.

76
00:06:44,30 --> 00:06:44,69
Then you know

77
00:06:47,97 --> 00:06:52,61
and what.

78
00:06:54,22 --> 00:07:00,14
Happened. I think over the
last five years. Nimbin.

79
00:07:00,64 --> 00:07:06,72
Sort of the quality of people
who come here has changed.

80
00:07:09,51 --> 00:07:16,71
I think they might seen
nimbin as a haven to.

81
00:07:16,73 --> 00:07:18,87
To practice their.

82
00:07:18,89 --> 00:07:24,18
Their habit as you might say may seem
to think that they can come here

83
00:07:24,18 --> 00:07:28,46
and do it freely and not done
anything happen to them and

84
00:07:28,46 --> 00:07:32,65
that seems to attract all
that sort of person.

85
00:07:33,45 --> 00:07:37,12
I mean the still some very
nice people come into that

86
00:07:37,13 --> 00:07:44,09
and we certainly have our share of
the ones who who leave a bit to be

87
00:07:44,09 --> 00:07:44,34
desired.

88
00:07:44,59 --> 00:07:53,00
Let's say.

89
00:07:53,02 --> 00:07:59,91
I buy the food for them for the money
and i mean i need to know now.

90
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,33
Then talking to ourselves
to learn them i are i.e.

91
00:08:08,72 --> 00:08:15,62
To fidget introducing ours out.
Literally to calum street and.

92
00:08:15,64 --> 00:08:19,80
During the best of all i work but
isee do it at that as you can

93
00:08:19,80 --> 00:08:25,78
but do you little reason before.

94
00:08:28,48 --> 00:08:31,58
Most quiet much wider than now.

95
00:08:36,79 --> 00:08:40,75
Everyone came to town on saturday mornings
i suppose you know wasn't modern a lot

96
00:08:40,75 --> 00:08:47,46
in them been before the festival.

97
00:08:47,48 --> 00:08:52,95
So the way. You know whether it ever died.

98
00:08:52,97 --> 00:08:58,09
The cattle industry in that
sort of thing was all going.

99
00:08:58,11 --> 00:08:59,33
Shops were closing

100
00:08:59,33 --> 00:09:04,05
but i think there would always been a few
shops in them then i think we would have

101
00:09:04,05 --> 00:09:05,92
died completely.

102
00:09:09,07 --> 00:09:12,47
What was your reaction when
you first heard the first.

103
00:09:16,90 --> 00:09:21,59
Shock. I had mixed feelings.
Yes i did have mixed feelings.

104
00:09:24,43 --> 00:09:27,84
I can't be responsible for having it because
i wasn't here when they voted it in

105
00:09:27,84 --> 00:09:29,63
or out. I was a holidaying away.

106
00:09:30,95 --> 00:09:35,17
No one but i don't regret having it

107
00:09:35,17 --> 00:09:42,11
and i regret being here today.

108
00:09:42,13 --> 00:09:47,69
The preparation was not a lot i
can remember them being here

109
00:09:47,69 --> 00:09:49,79
and sort of you know
doing their own thing.

110
00:09:52,81 --> 00:09:55,88
Just more or less you know
sort of marching them.

111
00:09:56,03 --> 00:09:59,90
I suppose go down onto the
fields and and do it. I didn't.

112
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,20
Sort of i wasn't involved
in it something that.

113
00:10:07,81 --> 00:10:07,88
We.

114
00:10:08,42 --> 00:10:15,20
Which are you know just them sort of
getting prepared for it on the field with

115
00:10:15,20 --> 00:10:18,95
their toilets and just
fixing it up in general

116
00:10:18,95 --> 00:10:25,08
and sort of getting about talking to
people and. Getting to know them.

117
00:10:25,24 --> 00:10:28,81
I think i got to know them quite well
i have a time that they were here

118
00:10:29,71 --> 00:10:35,00
and you know and i think
some of them are still here.

119
00:10:35,11 --> 00:10:39,42
Some of them are gone but some of
them are still here and it's people

120
00:10:39,42 --> 00:10:42,34
that originally sort of
started that i think

121
00:10:45,69 --> 00:10:52,33
when the first. Shock horror.

122
00:10:53,05 --> 00:10:58,84
There was just so many people in town of
the we stood behind a counter for 14 days

123
00:10:58,84 --> 00:11:02,97
and thought oh no i just saw people there
was just nothing else to say it was just

124
00:11:02,97 --> 00:11:05,67
so busy you know i think at

125
00:11:05,67 --> 00:11:09,89
that time was about all you could say
there was just time and he paid all

126
00:11:09,89 --> 00:11:11,69
that it was unreal

127
00:11:11,69 --> 00:11:15,99
that a small town like nimbin could
just have so many people come in

128
00:11:17,38 --> 00:11:26,69
and can you describe the sort of people.

129
00:11:28,02 --> 00:11:30,08
Family and there is.

130
00:11:31,32 --> 00:11:35,84
Some some a wonderful my world and i feel
the most buyers were wonderful people

131
00:11:37,99 --> 00:11:39,77
and i just sort of stood there

132
00:11:39,77 --> 00:11:42,17
and think well will we ever get
out of this place alive you know

133
00:11:42,17 --> 00:11:44,25
but then we had no trouble
behind that counter

134
00:11:44,25 --> 00:11:48,74
and those people were probably 10 day.

135
00:11:48,76 --> 00:11:55,07
All i could die was probably they have
a marvellous very patient people.

136
00:11:55,33 --> 00:11:59,76
But we were there but i thought they
were they were i mean it was things out.

137
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:02,80
That's just a whole lot of there's a
lot of drinking i suppose there was

138
00:12:03,69 --> 00:12:05,64
but that's what it was all
about wasn't it was a fit

139
00:12:06,67 --> 00:12:09,86
but i think the biggest shock was
when they didn't all go away.

140
00:12:14,00 --> 00:12:17,94
You knew. People with you.

141
00:12:21,42 --> 00:12:24,20
Know i don't think we
did i really am truly.

142
00:12:24,77 --> 00:12:30,72
That most of them i suppose we were naive
we didn't expect them to say and then

143
00:12:30,72 --> 00:12:34,71
when you think back you think well why
would you expect all people to go. Why.

144
00:12:34,72 --> 00:12:41,65
But we didn't expect them to
steinert. We just didn't.

145
00:12:42,41 --> 00:12:43,35
I don't i don't regret

146
00:12:43,35 --> 00:12:47,35
that some of them have i love i said
i've made some good friends out of those

147
00:12:47,35 --> 00:12:50,58
people that have came after the festival.

148
00:12:50,60 --> 00:12:55,73
You know and that's where i suppose you
know if we rounded up all the ones

149
00:12:55,73 --> 00:12:58,81
that did come with the festival
them i can be a lot of them.

150
00:12:59,14 --> 00:13:03,74
Here they are their children some
of their children would be but.

151
00:13:07,53 --> 00:13:09,75
There is some of them still
here and i know there is

152
00:13:09,75 --> 00:13:13,30
but like there was just so many people
in that fortnight you couldn't cite

153
00:13:14,39 --> 00:13:16,62
when yes i got to know this first
and there were some of them

154
00:13:16,62 --> 00:13:19,84
that we did get to know it
was you know two young girls

155
00:13:19,84 --> 00:13:23,80
that we sort of got to talk
to them and sort of thing.

156
00:13:23,90 --> 00:13:28,35
You know talking about happy memories of
festivals now probably one of the things

157
00:13:28,35 --> 00:13:29,13
that i can recall

158
00:13:29,13 --> 00:13:34,24
that i really enjoyed was we shut the shop
side for two hours from it to o'clock in

159
00:13:34,24 --> 00:13:38,82
the morning decline at them and there
was a you know by the name of dennis

160
00:13:40,05 --> 00:13:41,71
and he used to come
along with these guitar

161
00:13:41,71 --> 00:13:46,45
and we used to dance in this room in di's
is you know until we either to go and

162
00:13:46,45 --> 00:13:47,89
that was great. That was fun.

163
00:13:48,73 --> 00:13:54,15
Just the staff and then us playing
his guitar and so and he was part of

164
00:13:54,15 --> 00:13:59,65
that festival. You know. That to me
was something that i will remember.

165
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,21
Personally from that but the wrong.

166
00:14:06,49 --> 00:14:10,36
In that 14. I mean the actual 14 days of
that festival that would be something

167
00:14:10,36 --> 00:14:15,70
that i would remember with a lot of joy.

168
00:14:15,72 --> 00:14:17,60
As well we always said

169
00:14:17,60 --> 00:14:22,60
that we would have an our little party mall
everyone else was sort of havin theirs

170
00:14:22,60 --> 00:14:27,15
you know and there was and. And we
had you know there was probably and.

171
00:14:28,58 --> 00:14:30,65
10 or 12 of us that worked in di's is

172
00:14:30,65 --> 00:14:35,22
and they were long shifts i said you sort
of think of them think never went to bed

173
00:14:35,22 --> 00:14:38,73
without a bath in abbott your side tied
that you just pulled out and go to sleep

174
00:14:38,73 --> 00:14:42,12
and get up and keep going
again and you didn't do that

175
00:14:42,12 --> 00:14:46,62
but now i've got fond memories of some
of those things that happened during

176
00:14:46,63 --> 00:14:52,44
that 14 days. I think a lot of sad
things have come out after not from

177
00:14:52,44 --> 00:14:58,05
that actual festival. You know along that
20 years it hasn't all been wonderful.

178
00:14:58,19 --> 00:15:02,11
Since then. So.

179
00:15:09,66 --> 00:15:15,44
Well. Shops you know that the i
think the town has grown in itself.

180
00:15:19,45 --> 00:15:21,04
Earlier in the place.

181
00:15:21,06 --> 00:15:27,56
There was a lot of who
i just say this bit in

182
00:15:28,33 --> 00:15:30,33
things that just didn't strike

183
00:15:30,34 --> 00:15:33,60
and if these are spared you could
call it just didn't so you know i do.

184
00:15:33,60 --> 00:15:36,28
Why because and i think
that came from the fact

185
00:15:36,28 --> 00:15:40,43
that we thought those people were
going to pack up and go in 20 years.

186
00:15:40,80 --> 00:15:47,55
What we have here now. I think we became
very tolerant of one another and now.

187
00:15:47,57 --> 00:15:52,75
I think that things have a in themselves
they are i'm not saying that.

188
00:15:52,77 --> 00:15:55,64
We don't get cross with one
another at times and that.

189
00:15:55,92 --> 00:15:59,21
And i suppose we get cross
with each other you know but.

190
00:16:00,79 --> 00:16:05,04
I think we've become we've come a
long way in 20 years that we can say

191
00:16:05,04 --> 00:16:07,97
that we are tolerant of one another now

192
00:16:07,97 --> 00:16:13,11
and we can you know this issues
that we'll never agree on

193
00:16:14,20 --> 00:16:16,84
but you know we'll talk and sort of yes

194
00:16:16,84 --> 00:16:21,99
and sort of say yes i do belong
to our area you know and

195
00:16:21,99 --> 00:16:22,68
that sort of thing

196
00:16:23,88 --> 00:16:30,09
but nimbin has changed my mind.

197
00:16:30,11 --> 00:16:34,24
This time and he has us up and healed the
so many beautiful homes up in the hills.

198
00:16:34,36 --> 00:16:39,48
There's you know some people say
there's always these in heels

199
00:16:39,48 --> 00:16:42,02
but you've got to get out
there in those hills and say.

200
00:16:42,12 --> 00:16:44,05
And there is lovely homes in those fields

201
00:16:44,05 --> 00:16:52,74
that those people have put there.

202
00:16:52,75 --> 00:16:57,26
And sometimes i think the town doesn't
look as clean as it used to but then

203
00:16:58,80 --> 00:17:02,59
when you count them probably
not a couple of thousand.

204
00:17:02,99 --> 00:17:07,17
I thought and probably thirty
thousand people. Sometime.

205
00:17:08,09 --> 00:17:10,15
So you can expect that anyway.

206
00:17:10,21 --> 00:17:14,26
Up you can't keep a small town kleinman
i just sort of got more people in a day

207
00:17:14,26 --> 00:17:18,58
that barry does a marvelous
job of keeping it clean.

208
00:17:18,78 --> 00:17:23,64
But you know there's times
and i wanted to have him.

209
00:17:25,91 --> 00:17:30,01
Definite change but i don't think
it's for the worse the past

210
00:17:30,01 --> 00:17:32,67
and i think we have got a
bit of a drug problem here.

211
00:17:32,75 --> 00:17:33,27
But then i suppose

212
00:17:33,27 --> 00:17:37,78
that they've really i don't know
because i haven't travelled a lot.

213
00:17:37,79 --> 00:17:44,33
This is home and and you know from a
holiday at the beach or somewhere like

214
00:17:44,33 --> 00:17:48,57
that you just sort of here so i don't
know whether they have bigger problems

215
00:17:48,57 --> 00:17:54,01
and what we've got anywhere
else. Living through.

216
00:18:01,84 --> 00:18:05,46
Early in the piece i think you know
people run around without their claws on

217
00:18:05,46 --> 00:18:08,86
although i mean i think that's gone too.

218
00:18:08,88 --> 00:18:13,21
I think people have become even from
that so out of it just became aware

219
00:18:13,21 --> 00:18:16,73
that you know where but
we're not going to just.

220
00:18:18,94 --> 00:18:22,14
I think they sort of came here
thought well that was a fact of life

221
00:18:22,14 --> 00:18:24,75
and that's what we're going
to do but then they realize

222
00:18:24,75 --> 00:18:29,41
that not everybody was the
end of that so they stopped.

223
00:18:34,13 --> 00:18:39,31
Other things you know cartwheels and.

224
00:18:40,06 --> 00:18:44,77
Not a lot of you laugh at things

225
00:18:44,77 --> 00:18:48,71
and i think if you didn't laugh at things
you wouldn't live here you can get a

226
00:18:48,71 --> 00:18:50,29
sense of humor. You don't live in nimbin.

227
00:18:50,59 --> 00:18:57,67
You really.

228
00:18:57,69 --> 00:19:00,51
You know people just go with it

229
00:19:00,51 --> 00:19:05,16
or just anything you know i
mean sure you know dies.

230
00:19:06,54 --> 00:19:12,64
Life here in him but when
you come and live this.

231
00:19:14,13 --> 00:19:19,89
In a fortnight your see what i mean it's
different it's just different living here

232
00:19:19,89 --> 00:19:26,79
you've got to you've got
to love him to live in it.

233
00:19:28,38 --> 00:19:32,42
Oh for sure. I think
it has i think it had.

234
00:19:35,98 --> 00:19:37,99
Said we couldn't tolerate one another.

235
00:19:38,10 --> 00:19:39,31
In the beginning of

236
00:19:39,31 --> 00:19:46,09
that kind of mind up until probably
15 year ago i think you know we

237
00:19:46,09 --> 00:19:48,72
you know i think oh my god you
know we're going to go out

238
00:19:48,72 --> 00:19:49,97
that i don't see them funny people

239
00:19:51,03 --> 00:19:55,35
and we think most of us got to a stage
where you sort of said oh we live just out

240
00:19:55,35 --> 00:19:59,92
of bliss no we didn't dare tell people
we lived in newman. And that now.

241
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,26
Do you do you say yes we live in him
and you know we're proud of that day

242
00:20:03,26 --> 00:20:09,38
but so yes we've we've all grown up and
all of us i think in them has grown

243
00:20:09,38 --> 00:20:12,76
and we've grown up together
and that's something

244
00:20:12,76 --> 00:20:18,21
that we should be proud of the part.

245
00:20:19,48 --> 00:20:25,36
Well i had joanne in august and in the
festival was the following night. So.

246
00:20:27,33 --> 00:20:29,03
When the oldest would have been about i'd

247
00:20:30,18 --> 00:20:32,62
and i would have went to school
children during that festival.

248
00:20:33,42 --> 00:20:34,33
I can remember time

249
00:20:34,33 --> 00:20:37,73
that would have gotten another thing with
i had one walk through the fields you

250
00:20:37,73 --> 00:20:40,05
know and i sort of take
you know beyond that.

251
00:20:40,09 --> 00:20:42,47
Oh mummy at the root
they've got my clothes on.

252
00:20:42,47 --> 00:20:45,60
So you know mammy sort of
grabbed them and ran off and.

253
00:20:45,61 --> 00:20:48,84
I didn't know what those people you know.

254
00:20:48,91 --> 00:20:50,05
So let them

255
00:20:55,18 --> 00:20:56,00
but they enjoyed it.

256
00:20:56,03 --> 00:20:59,05
I think you know what those two
older ones would remember of it

257
00:20:59,05 --> 00:21:00,99
when they would remember
it more than anything.

258
00:21:02,76 --> 00:21:06,15
I suppose i didn't sort of get out a lot
because you could move on the streets in

259
00:21:06,15 --> 00:21:13,12
that fortnight but after that they you
know. Sort of grew with it. I know that.

260
00:21:16,04 --> 00:21:16,83
My never encouraged

261
00:21:16,83 --> 00:21:20,06
and you know you're only going to have tried
friends don't you bring him because i

262
00:21:20,06 --> 00:21:24,58
think now it's kids around through this
house as much as anybody's kids you know

263
00:21:25,71 --> 00:21:29,28
and i encourage that sort
of felt that was important

264
00:21:31,11 --> 00:21:32,49
that if they were all
going to school together

265
00:21:32,49 --> 00:21:37,59
that they had to be they were all
children and they belong to somebody and

266
00:21:37,60 --> 00:21:42,82
that was how we thought
of this or that that

267
00:21:42,82 --> 00:21:45,38
that was the why we were
going to go that you know

268
00:21:45,38 --> 00:21:48,07
that they were all children
out there together

269
00:21:48,07 --> 00:21:50,58
and that's what we we wanted for them.

270
00:21:51,87 --> 00:21:55,52
And i think it's a done the more
good than harm growing up in the end

271
00:21:55,52 --> 00:21:59,28
and i think our children
learned a lot and i didn't.

272
00:22:02,17 --> 00:22:04,46
I think i really think they they they did

273
00:22:04,46 --> 00:22:08,06
and i learned a lot through
being here in that 20 years.

274
00:22:08,72 --> 00:22:15,64
During and after that first of all i'm
not disappointed i read them here.

275
00:22:16,74 --> 00:22:16,93
Really.

276
00:22:22,76 --> 00:22:27,54
Will mainly through not not so
much with parents. I think.

277
00:22:32,41 --> 00:22:38,48
Some of i think i was more concerned about
the education department sort of getting

278
00:22:38,48 --> 00:22:41,42
into more of this.

279
00:22:41,43 --> 00:22:45,54
Free education instead of you know
being in a classroom doing things

280
00:22:45,54 --> 00:22:47,95
that was me i manage speaking for me.

281
00:22:50,92 --> 00:22:54,30
I was used to the old way of schooling and
that's what i wanted for my children.

282
00:22:54,68 --> 00:22:59,37
I just felt that i needed that.

283
00:22:59,48 --> 00:23:06,43
And i think i still think that way you know.
And it was you know. But with us now.

284
00:23:06,46 --> 00:23:10,58
I don't think that i ever. You
know the kids or anything.

285
00:23:14,13 --> 00:23:18,91
Of you know i think i was i was in some
cases i would say i know you can't go to

286
00:23:18,91 --> 00:23:23,07
that person's plight because it was
a commune situation or something

287
00:23:23,07 --> 00:23:25,39
and i didn't know about it so

288
00:23:26,52 --> 00:23:31,90
but i didn't sort of argue
or fight or anything like

289
00:23:31,90 --> 00:23:36,15
that with other parents you know
i think that any that children

290
00:23:36,15 --> 00:23:37,59
that my children got to know the parents

291
00:23:37,59 --> 00:23:41,36
and i sort of had a thing as wearable
even though we know one another.

292
00:23:45,29 --> 00:23:49,96
It's not you know we didn't sort of now
the arrangements of one other time lords

293
00:23:49,96 --> 00:23:51,56
that.

294
00:23:52,68 --> 00:23:56,59
And because i lived here in town i safire's
you know after the years it was sort of

295
00:23:56,59 --> 00:23:59,92
easy for parents like mainly
when school social for them.

296
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,27
On the kids could come
here and get dressed

297
00:24:01,27 --> 00:24:05,57
and go off to school in the mums would
come and pick them up lighter and and

298
00:24:05,58 --> 00:24:09,46
that was sort of a nothing like that that.

299
00:24:11,10 --> 00:24:13,85
Probably my kids didn't go to
the communes and that a lot

300
00:24:13,85 --> 00:24:18,38
but they sort of went out as a
group of kids a lot to try things

301
00:24:18,39 --> 00:24:23,12
that was on more than lay being
in homes and that together.

302
00:24:25,65 --> 00:24:32,59
Said if i had it all over again i
would do it the same way. No one is.

303
00:24:33,01 --> 00:24:39,78
Worried because i don't know i don't
really know because i didn't know a lot

304
00:24:39,78 --> 00:24:42,13
so it was only.

305
00:24:42,15 --> 00:24:45,70
Probably a lot lighter in our
lives that we met a young couple

306
00:24:46,65 --> 00:24:50,60
and i had three little children and
we did go to town of our commune

307
00:24:50,60 --> 00:24:53,46
and bein in their home and
and things like that and

308
00:24:53,46 --> 00:24:58,22
that was to us was probably you know i know
because you know you hear those things

309
00:24:58,22 --> 00:25:00,64
all your run around on
communes with no flies on

310
00:25:00,64 --> 00:25:05,70
and this in a way we had a
lovely die on ton of commune in.

311
00:25:05,83 --> 00:25:08,35
And we didn't see very many people at all.

312
00:25:08,57 --> 00:25:11,50
You know that and i certainly
all and flies on i might add.

313
00:25:11,55 --> 00:25:15,21
When with that them so early in the post

314
00:25:15,21 --> 00:25:17,87
when our kids will it we
didn't know we were learning.

315
00:25:18,20 --> 00:25:23,89
We were learning and that we didn't know
what. But what sort of things went on.

316
00:25:23,89 --> 00:25:26,25
You know because we've never
had a home of our own

317
00:25:26,25 --> 00:25:28,51
and we wasn't living in a group of people.

318
00:25:28,79 --> 00:25:33,81
So we didn't know what we were so
much sort of easy to say i know.

319
00:25:33,84 --> 00:25:42,50
Then the very sort of worry
about what are they doing.

320
00:25:44,08 --> 00:25:45,87
With strangers and friends.

321
00:25:47,10 --> 00:25:52,11
You know i think we all had that same
idea that their own living here.

322
00:25:52,21 --> 00:25:56,61
Do you know how are they living you know
i don't think there was any real rumors

323
00:25:56,61 --> 00:25:59,92
about because no what the ones
the people that lived in.

324
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,12
None of us knew what was when you
they'd bought some land and we.

325
00:26:06,55 --> 00:26:09,88
And i don't think we knew we must they
were living when they have living in tents

326
00:26:09,88 --> 00:26:13,35
or you know what you try was
going to actually sleep in.

327
00:26:13,35 --> 00:26:17,93
When i got there whether he was going to
be bedded down on a blanket under the

328
00:26:17,93 --> 00:26:19,29
stars and what we didn't know.

329
00:26:19,64 --> 00:26:24,32
No no we did we didn't room of what was
happening because we didn't know we

330
00:26:24,33 --> 00:26:26,82
honestly didn't know how
they were living out there

331
00:26:28,20 --> 00:26:29,22
and i said it was years later

332
00:26:29,22 --> 00:26:33,92
that we actually were given the opportunity
to go on to that property and.

333
00:26:34,35 --> 00:26:40,25
And so that they all they did have heart
normal and the same as what we had and.

334
00:26:42,67 --> 00:26:48,63
So possibly now if i had a daughter of a
size i don't 10 i'd be quite happy if i

335
00:26:48,63 --> 00:26:51,76
knew that parent to say yes
look you know i'm happy

336
00:26:51,76 --> 00:26:55,41
but deep down year ago i
know i thought i wouldn't

337
00:26:56,34 --> 00:27:00,28
and i couldn't because i didn't
know but now that i've been there

338
00:27:00,28 --> 00:27:05,01
and i've i know that they've got nice
homes the same as not them whole.

339
00:27:05,21 --> 00:27:07,03
But that they are living to.

340
00:27:07,41 --> 00:27:08,19
What they can afford

341
00:27:09,88 --> 00:27:14,41
and probably because i'm older i
can say well yes i can understand

342
00:27:14,41 --> 00:27:17,49
that it's costing you know
15 years for them to get

343
00:27:17,49 --> 00:27:22,03
that size ready because we're still getting
this ready you have to 26 years you

344
00:27:22,03 --> 00:27:24,48
know there's lots of things to do as a but

345
00:27:24,49 --> 00:27:29,22
when i was younger i was probably not as
tolerant think you know probably living up

346
00:27:29,22 --> 00:27:30,50
then about a box of thing

347
00:27:31,67 --> 00:27:38,54
but now i've been there so now i know.

348
00:27:40,27 --> 00:27:44,61
Oh yes we've always and this but
then you look at it now but

349
00:27:44,62 --> 00:27:47,46
when we bought it it was four rooms

350
00:27:47,46 --> 00:27:51,77
and the brand it was falling off
it so it wasn't very old house

351
00:27:51,77 --> 00:27:57,67
that we'd sort of viva like i said 26 years
sort of still paddling along the do up

352
00:27:57,67 --> 00:27:59,95
you know and that's what.

353
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,99
So now i can relate to those people sort
of up there with two rooms a sort of a yes

354
00:28:04,99 --> 00:28:09,52
we've extended the veranda or we finally
got a bathroom on or something like

355
00:28:09,52 --> 00:28:12,56
that because you. You've done it yourself.

356
00:28:12,92 --> 00:28:14,64
But like i said when
you're younger i suppose

357
00:28:14,64 --> 00:28:21,12
and young children you don't think
more you know to broaden the mind.

358
00:28:21,24 --> 00:28:23,76
Think of i wouldn't let
my kids go up there

359
00:28:23,76 --> 00:28:28,26
but i think we were all the same we were
tougher so we didn't expect them to start.

360
00:28:28,50 --> 00:28:30,98
So we didn't expect them to we
didn't know what they were doing

361
00:28:30,98 --> 00:28:31,89
when they did buy

362
00:28:31,89 --> 00:28:41,04
that land up there are
how they were living.

363
00:28:43,19 --> 00:28:50,13
To work. We had all sorts of fun here.

364
00:28:55,44 --> 00:29:00,41
I don't know what we would have done you
know we probably just done what had to be

365
00:29:00,41 --> 00:29:06,69
done said sound right to
say that you know the cost

366
00:29:06,69 --> 00:29:12,08
but we're still doing it you know
in a funny sort of way. If you say.

367
00:29:12,10 --> 00:29:17,02
Something someone needs to go about
someone's got a child or you know

368
00:29:17,02 --> 00:29:18,81
and i think you just do it.

369
00:29:18,91 --> 00:29:23,42
That's a mother's instinct to do
that and i don't think that you know

370
00:29:23,42 --> 00:29:25,68
and because we were there in that shop.

371
00:29:27,28 --> 00:29:36,42
It was something you just.

372
00:29:38,28 --> 00:29:40,35
Look after kids.

373
00:29:42,68 --> 00:29:45,90
You know you talk to young
people that were really down.

374
00:29:46,26 --> 00:29:50,29
I mean it wasn't all and a lot
of those young kids came here

375
00:29:50,29 --> 00:29:54,72
and they didn't know what they were
doing when they got here right that.

376
00:29:54,74 --> 00:29:58,13
I mean if you could lend a helping
hand here. No cattle there are no.

377
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,11
I'm and i suppose we had a few
arguments to i can remember once

378
00:30:03,11 --> 00:30:06,88
when i went got a kid out of a cast right.

379
00:30:07,61 --> 00:30:12,79
But they had things you do
you know and it was doormen

380
00:30:12,79 --> 00:30:14,88
and the job was crimes
of i went and got it.

381
00:30:14,90 --> 00:30:17,43
The mother put it back you
know this sort of went on

382
00:30:19,40 --> 00:30:26,27
and i'm just anything in general not
you know there was some lovely young

383
00:30:26,27 --> 00:30:30,54
girls came here that we got
the press months i got here.

384
00:30:30,75 --> 00:30:32,78
I don't know why they had
to come here but i think

385
00:30:32,78 --> 00:30:35,64
that there's a big party
going on. Let's go.

386
00:30:37,25 --> 00:30:42,46
And so dies you know i don't actually.

387
00:30:50,23 --> 00:30:52,79
Think you.

388
00:30:55,76 --> 00:30:59,35
Well i think them that they're more
tolerant and they would have been if

389
00:30:59,35 --> 00:31:00,46
that had just gone up.

390
00:31:02,02 --> 00:31:08,03
Three kids not you know i don't know
whether we did still had a school.

391
00:31:09,15 --> 00:31:12,35
You know i'm going back when we would
have started school here but i'm sure

392
00:31:12,35 --> 00:31:15,75
that it would have you know we
didn't have a lot of children

393
00:31:15,75 --> 00:31:17,19
and we've got a big school now.

394
00:31:17,53 --> 00:31:20,10
So maybe we wouldn't have
had a school lot and i

395
00:31:20,10 --> 00:31:22,85
but i think they are though
they're more tolerant children

396
00:31:22,85 --> 00:31:26,24
and i would have been
had this not happened.

397
00:31:31,76 --> 00:31:32,78
I don't know how to explain.
