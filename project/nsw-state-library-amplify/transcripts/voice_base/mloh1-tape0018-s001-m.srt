1
00:00:01,13 --> 00:00:02,11
I'm talking to mr.

2
00:00:02,11 --> 00:00:05,70
William brindle who was an assistant
photographer on the sydney harbour bridge

3
00:00:05,70 --> 00:00:10,03
working for the public works. Do you
remember how you first got the job. Do most

4
00:00:10,03 --> 00:00:12,23
mental. Well yes i was

5
00:00:12,23 --> 00:00:18,22
a junior. Salesman in the shop
at kodak in george street

6
00:00:18,99 --> 00:00:23,62
and i've been there for about two years
and i was very keen to get out into

7
00:00:23,62 --> 00:00:28,33
photography and of course these were the
days when tough jobs were pretty tough.

8
00:00:28,35 --> 00:00:34,68
And one day one of the senior men in
kodak said to me. That mr bob bowed and

9
00:00:34,68 --> 00:00:37,77
whose aim with the public works
department was looking for

10
00:00:37,77 --> 00:00:44,13
a junior. And that he would need to introduce
him to me or introduce me to him as

11
00:00:44,13 --> 00:00:51,02
the case was and this happened and
eventually i got the job with bob

12
00:00:51,02 --> 00:00:57,16
bouton and we were then located
and bridge street in the works

13
00:00:57,16 --> 00:01:04,10
building up on the roof and these

14
00:01:04,11 --> 00:01:09,58
were the days of course of glass plates.
Our standard plate in those days with what

15
00:01:09,58 --> 00:01:12,05
we termed a whole plate which
was eight and a half by six and

16
00:01:12,05 --> 00:01:16,13
a half inches in size.
And. The cameras were

17
00:01:16,13 --> 00:01:22,64
a big beautifully made cameras of
cedar and brass and very heavy

18
00:01:23,73 --> 00:01:29,06
and i was to find that out as the bridge
progress and they had to cut these things

19
00:01:29,06 --> 00:01:35,21
up over the bridge arches and so on. But
before that time we were involved in

20
00:01:36,62 --> 00:01:41,06
work this was before they actually the
bridge was started being built. We were

21
00:01:41,06 --> 00:01:46,64
involved in work which required us to
photograph some of the old buildings around

22
00:01:46,64 --> 00:01:51,86
the rocks areas and buildings that were
adjacent both on the north sydney side and

23
00:01:51,86 --> 00:01:58,71
the doors point side to where the bridge
excavations would be made for the pylons.

24
00:01:59,43 --> 00:02:03,52
And also the blowing up of the or gun
emplacements that dawes point they were.

25
00:02:03,74 --> 00:02:10,43
These were pretty solid concrete and
placement and the buildings where it

26
00:02:10,43 --> 00:02:15,46
gammoned by. People from
the works department

27
00:02:17,59 --> 00:02:24,07
. And all cracks were registered. By
them and then we were sent along to

28
00:02:24,07 --> 00:02:30,05
photograph them and course these
were done in case of any possible.

29
00:02:31,10 --> 00:02:35,42
Legal battles later on for damages as

30
00:02:35,42 --> 00:02:42,35
a result of the blasting we. I suppose
did hundreds and hundreds of pictures

31
00:02:43,19 --> 00:02:48,47
of this nature at that time. Well then
of course there was the building of the

32
00:02:48,47 --> 00:02:55,43
workshops on the enormous your side
where luna park now stands and we

33
00:02:55,44 --> 00:03:01,08
went on from there with the covering
the excavation work for the pylons

34
00:03:01,91 --> 00:03:08,77
and well sort of i grew
up as the bridge grew

35
00:03:08,77 --> 00:03:14,02
i grew with it because i started with bob
bad and when i was eighteen and spent

36
00:03:14,02 --> 00:03:20,73
some years with him and i have
very vivid memories in those

37
00:03:20,73 --> 00:03:24,24
days with these big cameras when
we got to the stage of the arch.

38
00:03:24,24 --> 00:03:29,18
. Progressing across the
harbour. That you had

39
00:03:29,18 --> 00:03:35,36
a very do what yourself in the afternoons
in those days. The southerly buses used

40
00:03:35,36 --> 00:03:40,41
to come up very regularly about four o'clock
of an afternoon. And if you're up on

41
00:03:40,41 --> 00:03:46,89
top there and with these big cameras in the
southerly buster was due. You went for

42
00:03:46,89 --> 00:03:52,45
your life but in those days of
course the observatory used to drop

43
00:03:52,45 --> 00:03:56,79
a black ball. If sadly buster was due.
So we used to keep our eye on the

44
00:03:56,79 --> 00:04:02,14
observatory because it was very involved
so of course any rain about you wouldn't

45
00:04:02,14 --> 00:04:05,92
venture up there because it was too
slippery and there are no guardrails or

46
00:04:05,92 --> 00:04:09,97
anything of that nature.
It was just often just

47
00:04:09,97 --> 00:04:14,65
a. Piece of rope but a cross between

48
00:04:14,65 --> 00:04:21,19
a couple of stanchions for
you to hang onto. The

49
00:04:25,09 --> 00:04:27,36
water member. Do you remember
ever going up the creek

50
00:04:27,36 --> 00:04:33,76
a crane for taking photographs. Yes yes
indeed. And also on several occasions that

51
00:04:33,76 --> 00:04:39,65
we were dropped over in these wooden
cages. To photograph suspended over the

52
00:04:39,65 --> 00:04:44,34
harbour to photograph and you nearing
details which would be required

53
00:04:46,71 --> 00:04:50,41
this at times would be quite nerve
wracking but after you done it

54
00:04:50,41 --> 00:04:52,42
a few times you got quite a blouse

55
00:04:52,42 --> 00:04:58,91
a about it. Do you remember. Do you remember
of preparing for graphs of plans for

56
00:04:58,91 --> 00:05:04,24
bradfield early on. Oh
yes indeed we. We had

57
00:05:05,65 --> 00:05:10,82
standard negatives of the various designs
for the bridges which were put away very

58
00:05:10,82 --> 00:05:17,64
carefully and many occasions would get
rushed demands from dr bradfield to make

59
00:05:17,64 --> 00:05:22,48
extra print of these which he obviously
had to present to cabinet or of the

60
00:05:22,48 --> 00:05:29,40
government of the day to make his point.
And we would stay back often late at

61
00:05:29,40 --> 00:05:32,41
night to get the truth
for him. He was a man

62
00:05:32,41 --> 00:05:37,36
a very demanding fellow he he knew what
he wanted and he wanted it always wanted

63
00:05:37,36 --> 00:05:44,01
everything yesterday. Dude remember that
he used to do up plans or used to do up

64
00:05:44,01 --> 00:05:48,61
plans for the press. Yes
but not not very often.

65
00:05:52,15 --> 00:05:56,92
I don't know how brad feels relationships
where with the press of that day. My

66
00:05:56,92 --> 00:06:02,34
memory is not very good about this. Certainly
he would supply them with pictures

67
00:06:02,34 --> 00:06:05,91
that don't because we're in those days we
were generally day only source of this

68
00:06:05,91 --> 00:06:12,33
type of material is an embargo that the
sydney mail always got his early stuff and

69
00:06:12,33 --> 00:06:16,85
then that was usually copied in various
other papers. Yes. What that could be so

70
00:06:18,42 --> 00:06:22,81
that's what you're discussing mostly the
engineering photographs our plans and so

71
00:06:22,81 --> 00:06:26,96
on. That's right. Yes yes. Well of
course that would be so i don't think we

72
00:06:26,96 --> 00:06:31,42
supplied the press generally with actual
engineering details as the bridge

73
00:06:31,42 --> 00:06:37,42
progressed i think generally they were
allowed to take their own pictures. Yes

74
00:06:37,42 --> 00:06:42,43
right. Do you remember while you were
working on the on the bridge. If.

75
00:06:44,13 --> 00:06:47,89
The various other people. The working people
did you ever photograph them at work.

76
00:06:49,16 --> 00:06:54,55
Well yes we did because but generally
are work was only concerned with the

77
00:06:54,55 --> 00:06:59,47
engineering details and if the other
people were in these pictures. They were

78
00:06:59,47 --> 00:07:06,34
coincidental because we were not really
tied up in the human side of the of

79
00:07:06,34 --> 00:07:13,05
the of the bridge building it was not our
function. It was we weren't doing a p.r.

80
00:07:13,05 --> 00:07:19,83
Exercise as such it was it was you know
straightforward engineering detail.

81
00:07:20,89 --> 00:07:21,70
Bob bad and was

82
00:07:21,70 --> 00:07:28,01
a magnificent photographer and
he believed in accuracy and

83
00:07:29,38 --> 00:07:34,86
the fact he was dedicated to it and but
i don't think that he he would ever

84
00:07:37,33 --> 00:07:40,62
worry so much about human
interest but that you recall

85
00:07:40,62 --> 00:07:46,07
a an incident that also at the same time
we were covering the building of the

86
00:07:46,07 --> 00:07:52,27
underground tunnels for the railway for
the city railway and i remember on

87
00:07:52,27 --> 00:07:58,45
occasions this would involve big flashes.
Of the tunnels where you would use their

88
00:07:59,19 --> 00:08:05,02
own or blowgun type of thing which allowed
you to fire exposure to different

89
00:08:07,08 --> 00:08:11,91
fire flashes rather at different points
along the tunnels and sometimes if they

90
00:08:11,91 --> 00:08:17,35
were men working there you would see men
turn their backs to us or something of

91
00:08:17,35 --> 00:08:22,13
this nature involved bad and said he's
got a premier criminal record. It's

92
00:08:22,13 --> 00:08:26,34
a common thing they turn their backs on
you. Isn't it when it is right. I mean

93
00:08:26,34 --> 00:08:31,03
within like the flash. No no i think of
those days cause you know the jobs are hard

94
00:08:31,03 --> 00:08:35,74
to get and and for that type of work. I
don't think they were terribly fussy where

95
00:08:35,74 --> 00:08:42,56
they got their labours from but this did
happen quite frequently but if you talk

96
00:08:42,56 --> 00:08:48,89
about human relationships. My experience
of the harbour bridge workers was always

97
00:08:48,89 --> 00:08:54,99
that i've never worked which that youre
more honest hardworking crowd who were

98
00:08:54,99 --> 00:08:59,82
dedicated to their job their relationships
with each other were to my mind.

99
00:09:00,03 --> 00:09:04,42
Excellent. And i think that they knew that
they were battling against the elements

100
00:09:05,81 --> 00:09:11,55
and against all the engineering problems
to get this thing across and i think it

101
00:09:11,55 --> 00:09:12,23
gave them more or less

102
00:09:12,23 --> 00:09:17,24
a common cause. Yes many people have told
me that i was one thing i was wanting to

103
00:09:17,24 --> 00:09:22,43
ask you. Its relation to dr bradfield
it seems to me. Looking back at the

104
00:09:22,43 --> 00:09:25,22
photographs that you took that there was

105
00:09:26,36 --> 00:09:32,06
a little you know inordinate proportion
have bradfield in the foreground. Well yes

106
00:09:33,05 --> 00:09:34,22
. I think he was

107
00:09:34,22 --> 00:09:40,92
a publicity seeker. I think of
course of that period there were

108
00:09:40,92 --> 00:09:46,89
rumours that. Things were not always happy
between some of doormen long's engineers

109
00:09:46,89 --> 00:09:51,62
and bradfield in my lowly position of
course i didn't know the the rights of this

110
00:09:51,62 --> 00:09:57,88
but you couldn't help but but grasp them
and it was actually taking place but. I

111
00:09:57,88 --> 00:10:02,91
think that possibly it had to push himself
because pushing himself he was pushing

112
00:10:02,91 --> 00:10:09,32
the bridge and quite honestly i
give him full credit for this. Is.

113
00:10:10,53 --> 00:10:14,99
Looking back also. Can you remember what
the well the conditions of work for you as

114
00:10:14,99 --> 00:10:21,80
a photographer were like
in those days. Well we had

115
00:10:23,33 --> 00:10:25,85
we had reasonable facilities there was

116
00:10:25,85 --> 00:10:32,76
a lot of money available for equipment
or anything of that nature. But our

117
00:10:32,77 --> 00:10:37,26
relationships were dumb and long were
excellent because they realized that that

118
00:10:37,26 --> 00:10:42,38
they had access to our pictures and they
wanted them taken and in fact often our

119
00:10:42,38 --> 00:10:48,16
pictures help them and the job because
we had regular intervals we would take

120
00:10:48,16 --> 00:10:54,12
pictures. With the camera erected on the
triangle like triangulation points which

121
00:10:54,12 --> 00:10:59,39
were situated there i think there are three
of them for memory. To ignore sydney

122
00:10:59,39 --> 00:11:06,16
and one on the doors point side and these
were where the surveyors erected their

123
00:11:07,30 --> 00:11:13,23
theodolite to check on the progress of
the arch to make certain that they were

124
00:11:13,23 --> 00:11:19,59
holding their line across the
harbour and you know we always

125
00:11:19,59 --> 00:11:26,55
received excellent cooperation from all
the doormen long people. And it was

126
00:11:26,55 --> 00:11:27,63
a very happy time it was

127
00:11:27,63 --> 00:11:33,97
a hard time in the sense that the equipment
was very heavy encumber some compared

128
00:11:33,98 --> 00:11:40,11
to modern photography. Do you ever going
down to the quarry. No i never went down

129
00:11:40,11 --> 00:11:41,55
to the quarry. But as

130
00:11:41,55 --> 00:11:47,99
a funny story about that you did this
interview recalls about two years ago wife

131
00:11:48,01 --> 00:11:51,63
and i were touring around the south coast
and i was fishing awful wharf in the

132
00:11:51,63 --> 00:11:58,35
earlier river and up. Picked up. I didn't
pick them up. I lost him but i obviously

133
00:11:58,35 --> 00:12:02,48
hooked a decent sized fish which i
thought must have been some sort of

134
00:12:02,48 --> 00:12:09,29
a decent jewfish. And he took me
down under some debris in the

135
00:12:09,29 --> 00:12:15,07
river bed. And i lost. I had to cut my line
away i couldn't get him up and looking

136
00:12:15,07 --> 00:12:19,39
around i suddenly realise that this was
the war where the concrete where the

137
00:12:20,89 --> 00:12:26,02
granite blocks for the harbour bridge
pylons were loaded and that only just

138
00:12:26,02 --> 00:12:32,83
a few yards away was the start of the
quarry in fact i started to look around

139
00:12:32,83 --> 00:12:34,24
and in amongst a long.
