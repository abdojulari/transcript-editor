1
00:00:04,74 --> 00:00:06,61
I think she was a typist or like

2
00:00:06,61 --> 00:00:12,62
a receptionist and she was working down
there in this in this sea station. Well.

3
00:00:14,60 --> 00:00:19,86
I was when the department of representatives
down there and got the over the phone

4
00:00:19,86 --> 00:00:26,48
. One night i got the. Got the yellow alert
that was the red the green and the and

5
00:00:27,47 --> 00:00:31,71
which meant you had to get out was fast as
you could. So this is about two o'clock

6
00:00:31,71 --> 00:00:35,90
in the morning so i did nothing really.
Said yellow alert and i knew what that

7
00:00:35,90 --> 00:00:41,33
meant i had to when you get down to
the bottom ground floor bowels and

8
00:00:42,93 --> 00:00:49,41
so away i know there were no taxis. There
were no buses there was no nothing. Say

9
00:00:49,42 --> 00:00:55,05
a cushion and then
membered. Oh gosh there's

10
00:00:55,05 --> 00:01:01,95
a spare my truck down the manly bus depot
hollering up the whole ring up the

11
00:01:02,81 --> 00:01:07,06
bloke in charge down there telling her i
wasn't going to have his truck to get over

12
00:01:07,06 --> 00:01:08,75
sydney i have urgent i had to go in

13
00:01:08,75 --> 00:01:12,93
a hurry. So he said look i know what
you're talking about. I know what you're

14
00:01:12,93 --> 00:01:19,43
talking about he said the tracks elsewhere.
So i said. What i'd do to get i got to

15
00:01:19,43 --> 00:01:24,40
get out of the straightaway. He said leave
it to me leave it to me. I said. Right.

16
00:01:24,45 --> 00:01:28,65
I believe it. You know he seemed fairly
confident within about ten minutes

17
00:01:28,65 --> 00:01:29,84
a quarter and how there was

18
00:01:29,84 --> 00:01:36,64
a double decker bus pulled up
outside. So. I got broken that

19
00:01:36,64 --> 00:01:41,19
always that the buses waiting for you. So
i day were over to town in this double

20
00:01:41,19 --> 00:01:47,63
decker bus. Well that was all right. I
went down to be did what i had to do. Down

21
00:01:47,63 --> 00:01:53,52
came home later on but when i got back
to the office. Louise chief traffic

22
00:01:53,52 --> 00:02:00,49
management. He was calling for your i got
me on the intercom and he was robel what

23
00:02:00,49 --> 00:02:05,01
i'd done i'd take the bus out of service
and manley would bus services in many

24
00:02:05,01 --> 00:02:10,33
cases but i'd take them so he said why going
to the commissioner i'll tell you this

25
00:02:10,34 --> 00:02:15,48
is absolutely unthinkable i'm just here
frank manager that was my you know all the

26
00:02:15,48 --> 00:02:20,59
rubbish they go on. So i said right oh
that's the best thing you can do then you go

27
00:02:20,59 --> 00:02:24,47
ahead. So about half an hour later there's

28
00:02:24,47 --> 00:02:31,25
a bus. I wish this message. Are waiting
and he said look mr pizza commissions

29
00:02:31,25 --> 00:02:36,56
waiting for you would you come up and see
him sort i preside now. Went up their

30
00:02:36,56 --> 00:02:39,47
mobility said he said you took

31
00:02:39,47 --> 00:02:46,19
a bus out of service morning mr police.
I said yes i didn't just i commend your

32
00:02:46,19 --> 00:02:53,03
action very much. But said it right down
the ground. What the other bloke right

33
00:02:53,03 --> 00:02:59,21
over because i didn't like it really goes.
So there i think about it but what did

34
00:02:59,21 --> 00:03:06,11
you have to go down there for anyway i
was departmental representatives. And

35
00:03:06,11 --> 00:03:13,05
part of the part of the arrangements were
that the wardens in charge of particular

36
00:03:13,05 --> 00:03:19,47
areas in the event of an emergency
happening. Had to get in touch with their

37
00:03:19,47 --> 00:03:25,14
headquarters filling or forward over the
fire and these girls on the other end

38
00:03:25,93 --> 00:03:31,39
would would fill it and type
them out and people or all this.

39
00:03:33,32 --> 00:03:35,35
To think. They had

40
00:03:35,35 --> 00:03:41,49
a u-shaped table and the
message was read comsec.

41
00:03:42,14 --> 00:03:46,77
Get sick. It really is. You went right
and anything very important which would

42
00:03:46,77 --> 00:03:51,71
affect their department they who were in
direct telephone communication direct line

43
00:03:51,71 --> 00:03:56,73
to that and you then report to the department.
What it was you thought that way.

44
00:03:56,78 --> 00:04:03,75
Should now go out and take the
necessary action. From then on in

45
00:04:03,75 --> 00:04:09,100
the years to have these to
have these these. Mock fairs

46
00:04:10,75 --> 00:04:12,67
and everybody come in

47
00:04:12,67 --> 00:04:18,93
a way to put it past the bond i junctions
are blown up or something like that. The

48
00:04:18,93 --> 00:04:25,33
moment the middle of central station but
anybody or any consequence had to to pick

49
00:04:25,34 --> 00:04:29,36
out what was interesting. Let them
know. Well you know this involves

50
00:04:29,36 --> 00:04:36,02
a lot of time as they have to get messages
over all over the and these typists

51
00:04:36,02 --> 00:04:41,31
i who i believe principally employed
by the railway department was typists.

52
00:04:43,07 --> 00:04:46,91
No one of them on the upper
floor a couple of off for

53
00:04:46,91 --> 00:04:51,27
a long winded house where the railway station
is now they were slip on their health

54
00:04:51,27 --> 00:04:55,94
just released this week cases like that.
So these girls had been pulled out

55
00:04:55,94 --> 00:05:00,70
a bit about two o'clock in the morning and
they came down into this conference room

56
00:05:01,45 --> 00:05:07,59
and you never saw more drag women fight in
all your life i've been pulled out of it

57
00:05:07,59 --> 00:05:12,86
. I haven't had time to get dressed like.
Dressing gowns and hair all over the

58
00:05:12,86 --> 00:05:19,76
place you know. Completely
absence of what about you

59
00:05:19,76 --> 00:05:23,96
might be you must look pretty terrible to.
Oh yes we probably i got. Straight out

60
00:05:23,96 --> 00:05:28,30
a bit i stated i mean a
race should look like

61
00:05:28,30 --> 00:05:30,89
a cuppa tea. That's seen

62
00:05:30,89 --> 00:05:37,66
a piece of cake by the silence plus it
turned up and i got to go to work and.

63
00:05:37,68 --> 00:05:43,96
Do you remember the day that the of the
submarine attack were you were in the

64
00:05:43,96 --> 00:05:49,21
committee at that time. Yes yes yes i was
down there defend out after what it was

65
00:05:49,21 --> 00:05:55,99
all about. But you weren't actually down
there during the attack. I don't know

66
00:05:55,99 --> 00:06:01,49
you don't know would get the alarm i mean
right well that well they were i don't

67
00:06:01,49 --> 00:06:06,75

Laughter. Well that sounds like what happened

68
00:06:06,75 --> 00:06:11,30
then. Because judith writes that she was
on duty down there at time and they didn't

69
00:06:11,30 --> 00:06:14,100
know to let came up. Well
i didn't know about it.
