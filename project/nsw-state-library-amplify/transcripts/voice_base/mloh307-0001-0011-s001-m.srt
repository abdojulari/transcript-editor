1
00:00:10,45 --> 00:00:14,13
This is Station eleven recorded with faith.

2
00:00:15,27 --> 00:00:28,74
Bandler and Karen Craig Tuesday the twelfth of August one nine hundred ninety seven in approximately ten seconds time.

3
00:00:28,76 --> 00:00:31,23
Faced you just want to pick up from where we left off.

4
00:00:32,88 --> 00:00:39,56
Yes there was I got to finish off a little about the Aboriginal Australia and finish it.

5
00:00:39,58 --> 00:00:48,06
As I told you in the beginning the goal was to work for the evolution of the New South Wales Aboriginal welfare.

6
00:00:48,07 --> 00:00:56,99
That was Polls here. Well we campaigned against the board for thirteen years. No stop.

7
00:00:58,06 --> 00:01:06,49
And Tony just this tiny group of people lived and breathed the work of a fellowship.

8
00:01:07,67 --> 00:01:16,75
And as one of the Aboriginal person came brindle. Said. I've never met a group of people like this.

9
00:01:16,8 --> 00:01:25,74
I was strange to me they didn't talk about Jesus and I didn't talk about this

10
00:01:25,75 --> 00:01:32,59
and all those things that all the other organizations talked about you know getting people to be Christians.

11
00:01:33,23 --> 00:01:35,48
So full of.

12
00:01:35,5 --> 00:01:44,31
Funny little group of people who got together even in the middle of winter in a definitely old office there in

13
00:01:44,31 --> 00:01:53,23
Chinatown and thank you got stuck into the government. And I made positive.

14
00:01:53,25 --> 00:01:59,24
And well the government doesn't like money so that must be all right.

15
00:02:01,11 --> 00:02:10,32
But he could never understand us and he said to me one day earlier you were involved in this doesn't. To you.

16
00:02:12,03 --> 00:02:21,92
Running down the running all over the place and kicking up a fuss. He says we like it. Get out of the.

17
00:02:22,84 --> 00:02:33,94
Others get out of it and down there in that little office the great great woman. Jack and you know. Lenin mono fox.

18
00:02:34,46 --> 00:02:43,15
Bird Charlie Leo and paying. Us about it. When we took the state government on.

19
00:02:43,57 --> 00:02:50,06
Well Ken was amazed he couldn't understand he says and he looked a bit Graffy at times you know a lot.

20
00:02:50,2 --> 00:02:58,38
I didn't think you'd get anywhere. Well the fellowship worked very hard.

21
00:02:58,95 --> 00:03:05,3
First of all like challenge the ball or challenge the government the the.

22
00:03:05,35 --> 00:03:12,54
The lack of one right which the Aborigines were confronted with and that was the right to go into premises.

23
00:03:12,9 --> 00:03:14,79
Where alcohol was so hold

24
00:03:15,5 --> 00:03:23,34
and as a result of these men he suffered very much so because women in particular who were bringing their sick children

25
00:03:24,18 --> 00:03:28,22
from the waist in the south and.

26
00:03:28,23 --> 00:03:32,69
Would travel by train and these trains were very slow

27
00:03:33,86 --> 00:03:43,15
and so they would have to sit on the railway station because they wouldn't be permitted to have a room in a local pub.

28
00:03:43,16 --> 00:03:46,37
And the children would have to sit through that often in the winter.

29
00:03:46,62 --> 00:03:55,56
So apart from the fact that they were DID NOT a right great. People were suffering help.

30
00:03:56,24 --> 00:04:08,42
So we fought that section and if they have New South Wales. And we had it apart. And then it was so time.

31
00:04:09,57 --> 00:04:13,14
You know like sixty like sixty.

32
00:04:14,42 --> 00:04:16,86
Where there are ten sixteen zero on the board was abolished

33
00:04:18,03 --> 00:04:24,5
and what did the fellowship do they closed the organization. No one was there.

34
00:04:24,52 --> 00:04:29,82
To carve a career out of it for themselves and that had happened very much.

35
00:04:29,89 --> 00:04:33,48
And some of the Aboriginal charities that were.

36
00:04:33,5 --> 00:04:38,32
People quite got you know and they were paid a salary to look after the blacks you see

37
00:04:39,06 --> 00:04:46,22
and we didn't have people like that in the fellowship. So I want to make their point that immediately we reached.

38
00:04:46,24 --> 00:04:58,99
We close the organization. And that was in one nine hundred sixty. Now in nineteen fifty seven.

39
00:04:59,01 --> 00:05:10,58
The Federal Council was formed of child Dr Charles do good. And in many ways the work was being duplicated.

40
00:05:10,6 --> 00:05:13,22
Like housing education.

41
00:05:13,23 --> 00:05:24,15
Not so much into health but into equal employment and both organizations were doing very much the same work.

42
00:05:24,17 --> 00:05:27,59
It was a good thing in a way that the Fellowship closed.

43
00:05:28,1 --> 00:05:35,02
Because those skills and all of that experience then could be turned into the federal body which was formed.

44
00:05:36,84 --> 00:05:39,13
And I mentioned earlier.

45
00:05:39,85 --> 00:05:48,54
That he felt the motion was moved to the third or fourth conference or second conference of the federal.

46
00:05:48,56 --> 00:05:53,19
That it should be become responsible for the circulation of the petition for the referendum.

47
00:05:53,69 --> 00:06:08,5
And that was so then the petition began to become. The responsibility of the Federal Council. I would see.

48
00:06:09,67 --> 00:06:15,38
The people of Melbourne. And the people of Sydney.

49
00:06:15,4 --> 00:06:24,31
Were the leaders in that that is not in that campaign but that is not to say that the people who Western Australia

50
00:06:24,32 --> 00:06:30,26
and Queensland didn't pull the white they did but they didn't have the facilities that we had

51
00:06:30,96 --> 00:06:35,65
and I did not they did they have the people.

52
00:06:35,67 --> 00:06:44,85
On a broad level to pull the churches who were pulling this from us but we were able to do that in Melbourne

53
00:06:44,85 --> 00:06:47,06
and Sydney.

54
00:06:47,07 --> 00:06:57,57
Now Jack Horner who for about I mean the secretary of fellowship had now you know on the executive of the Federal

55
00:06:57,57 --> 00:07:10,9
Council and Jack is a very very dedicated dedicated and this and that the church had a duty here.

56
00:07:11,59 --> 00:07:15,82
And he would not let up until they saw that duty

57
00:07:15,82 --> 00:07:29,72
and it was a duty towards personal people that didn't have to do the charity. Well. Jack couldn't come.

58
00:07:30,52 --> 00:07:43,89
And I do know that time and again conferences in Sydney. And he was bad to the bishops. And. They all knew him.

59
00:07:45,19 --> 00:07:52,56
And fortunately we had among the Anglican bishops and reverend gentleman opposed

60
00:07:52,57 --> 00:07:55,56
and as I mentioned earlier a friend called Rick.

61
00:07:57,18 --> 00:07:59,34
Who took up a collection in the town hall for us

62
00:07:59,34 --> 00:08:17,5
or one of the two people who did that come to call Drake was an open door. And the corridors of that. Drive.

63
00:08:17,51 --> 00:08:22,54
And he wasn't going to have an admission charity.

64
00:08:23,75 --> 00:08:31,97
The federal Constitution had to be changed and of course I thought it crazy. How do you read the law. Do you Richard.

65
00:08:32,16 --> 00:08:43,72
You were a federal constitution. But he persisted and I cannot speak to. Honus dedication to and as well.

66
00:08:45,13 --> 00:08:51,2
So the petition got off the ground in a big way on a national level.

67
00:08:51,46 --> 00:09:04,59
Now I have touched on this because I remember saying how clean the house do all the meetings but during this time.

68
00:09:04,84 --> 00:09:24,26
There were people like myself who. Were in a way becoming nationally and in fact during the campaign.

69
00:09:24,28 --> 00:09:38,2
And this was also very involved with. And he and his wife invited me to go over and take some meeting.

70
00:09:40,23 --> 00:09:52,06
And I had been to Perth before. But more for my pleasure. And I went to have campaigning.

71
00:09:52,08 --> 00:10:02,14
And they wanted me with a local doctor who was the wife of one of the senators who was who would have me

72
00:10:02,14 --> 00:10:21,81
and my stay with people. Not have to go out. Speak so they booked me to the Travelodge and Gerald Walsh.

73
00:10:22,74 --> 00:10:31,12
Was just big becoming a journalist at the time and came to the travel hard to see me.

74
00:10:32,9 --> 00:10:41,5
And I was sort of floating rate guy but he just made for myself and I was going out to dinner with friend.

75
00:10:41,52 --> 00:10:54,1
But she came a knock tomato. So she came in and. They still kick them out.

76
00:10:54,12 --> 00:10:57,66
And they certainly not allow him to places like that

77
00:11:00,2 --> 00:11:10,8
and I think you should talk to some of those people who brought a few people picked me up or other

78
00:11:10,8 --> 00:11:17,21
and took me to make some of the people who were suffering these indignity he said it was one thing to go out

79
00:11:17,21 --> 00:11:23,22
and stand before the businessman or.

80
00:11:24,19 --> 00:11:32,56
Business Women's luncheon or what have you personally it was necessary to take the people along with us.

81
00:11:33,73 --> 00:11:36,55
And they should be informed of what we were on about.

82
00:11:36,75 --> 00:11:44,09
So I went to a group of people my countrymen personally whether it was a public meeting or.

83
00:11:45,12 --> 00:11:50,84
Which direction had organized and I talked about the need to hold this referendum.

84
00:11:51,54 --> 00:11:58,39
While our models are well I've been talking to. A brick wall. They weren't interested in the least.

85
00:11:59,75 --> 00:12:08,35
What about our houses. New jobs. What about all my people a sick then dying and. All of that you see me.

86
00:12:08,55 --> 00:12:12,72
Serious problems while lying heavily on their shoulders

87
00:12:13,73 --> 00:12:19,72
and you come here talking about changing the federal constitution should we change the federal constitution we want

88
00:12:19,72 --> 00:12:28,2
these things now. And do you see it was at a time when the state still fully controlled the Aboriginal people.

89
00:12:28,68 --> 00:12:37,9
And that had enough of their people had been flogged for their people had been jailed in the worst then people right in

90
00:12:37,9 --> 00:12:46,79
the forty's for working in what am I talking about the federal constitution for.

91
00:12:46,81 --> 00:12:55,51
And it was very difficult to convince the people what I refer him to do. That was a great lesson to me.

92
00:12:57,59 --> 00:12:59,88
And so I think I can say with confidence.

93
00:13:01,51 --> 00:13:08,22
That very few people comparatively speaking where involved in the referendum in the campaign.

94
00:13:08,89 --> 00:13:14,12
We had those who were very enlightened in Melbourne and Sydney.

95
00:13:14,14 --> 00:13:29,02
And perhaps a handful in the other states but that was about all those fires indigenous people. And.

96
00:13:30,22 --> 00:13:36,00
Just before you tell you that Britain can human in the late fifty's you went to post was that in the beginning.

97
00:13:36,92 --> 00:13:44,81
Into the sixty's into the sixty's that was well into the sixty's it was coming up close to sixty seven. Yeah.

98
00:13:45,34 --> 00:13:50,2
But early in the sixty's the fellowship.

99
00:13:50,22 --> 00:13:57,62
Decided that they should bring the Eversharp more a person

100
00:13:57,62 --> 00:14:03,86
or people into it a lot of Aboriginal people in New South Wales but then had tremendous faith in the fellowship.

101
00:14:04,35 --> 00:14:09,19
There wasn't another organisation going who would protect them from the. Who.

102
00:14:12,62 --> 00:14:22,29
So I thought well I better go over to read for a few minutes into the hair and see if I get them to pull a white.

103
00:14:23,28 --> 00:14:29,34
But Jack in June. Holder I think of us who sit well but if we're on a day.

104
00:14:29,36 --> 00:14:38,82
Now I haven't talked about the dances over there and they were for both the Federal Council and the fellowship to try.

105
00:14:38,84 --> 00:14:47,15
Well we had the Waterloo town hall. And we worked.

106
00:14:48,11 --> 00:14:53,33
And then we had a fellowship monthly meeting to finalize the right range plans for the first day.

107
00:14:53,95 --> 00:15:08,83
And who should turn up. And kid and he said listen you lot. What are you doing over there in my area. So you come.

108
00:15:08,85 --> 00:15:14,1
Now we run a dance for our footballers and I'll go do your day.

109
00:15:16,32 --> 00:15:21,74
What are we going to do to keep the bass on the first you see it. Incidentally it was black and white.

110
00:15:23,96 --> 00:15:32,62
So I was furious with us so we come to him and. He said Oh OK.

111
00:15:33,61 --> 00:15:41,49
You're on the dance on my mobile come up but we better have a look at his dances

112
00:15:41,49 --> 00:15:53,91
and if I compare couldn't compare it with. We were highly organized you see. There was surely some a.

113
00:15:55,13 --> 00:16:02,79
And she carried a good nineteen twenty nine. Surely necklace and surely what we need.

114
00:16:02,8 --> 00:16:08,06
Is that we're not going to have any drunks in the home. Because they'd come out after ten o'clock.

115
00:16:08,55 --> 00:16:09,54
After the pubs that close.

116
00:16:11,03 --> 00:16:16,63
And it wasn't that they could actually get the growing from the pub

117
00:16:16,63 --> 00:16:22,17
but they could get around the back as much as what it was illegal. So they'd come.

118
00:16:22,66 --> 00:16:34,24
And surely would stand at the top of the stairway and anyone who misbehaved would get just one with a huge chip

119
00:16:34,24 --> 00:16:44,25
and then go rolling down the stairs and she was like an eyebrow. Well. It was a bouncer. Absolutely.

120
00:16:44,37 --> 00:16:52,86
She was a bouncer and then the shows were rip roaring success. With the money with footballers.

121
00:16:53,58 --> 00:16:55,05
And we were a protection.

122
00:16:55,58 --> 00:17:02,71
You see for the people because what normally happened would be the cops would come and her under them

123
00:17:02,71 --> 00:17:06,47
but that doesn't mean that petty worked and.

124
00:17:06,49 --> 00:17:16,06
So life began to appreciate this group of people all looking very trim and proper.

125
00:17:16,08 --> 00:17:34,87
You know and I think glasses and hanging them and everyone like a glove so if you played so I had made afraid.

126
00:17:34,88 --> 00:17:48,76
Of a person by the name of Barry Cohen. And Barry at that time was already the. Clothing shop in the park.

127
00:17:48,78 --> 00:17:57,85
Thriving business to this very day. And this is going back an awful long time. And Barry said to me one day.

128
00:17:58,3 --> 00:18:02,51
But so what can I do what can I do if I really want to do something.

129
00:18:02,73 --> 00:18:08,49
It's terrible what they're doing to the Aboriginal people. I saw when I bury we're running these the.

130
00:18:09,94 --> 00:18:18,25
And why didn't you come over and give us a hand. By then we had a roster you see of for people to go over to refer to.

131
00:18:19,74 --> 00:18:25,32
Manager and. There is if you're sure of course I will.

132
00:18:26,21 --> 00:18:34,09
Now I had also become very friendly with through his wife and I saw all the children growing up to three.

133
00:18:34,9 --> 00:18:38,13
And at this time. Ray was hardly pregnant with the third one.

134
00:18:38,48 --> 00:18:46,58
So we left her at her friend's place who was a friend who was on the executive of the fellowship and hounds

135
00:18:46,58 --> 00:18:49,65
and I had a nice evening while we went over to read for.

136
00:18:51,08 --> 00:18:59,77
Barry being a business man I said listen very Your job is to take the five bob at the door for shillings entrance.

137
00:19:00,55 --> 00:19:05,71
So you sit here and I had trouble looking at. So you just walked at every shop as he always did.

138
00:19:05,75 --> 00:19:14,34
Amy and I recall a lady had to make a move since yellow pullover on and I went with him he picked me up

139
00:19:15,28 --> 00:19:18,58
and Jean gave him you know negation a few instructions about.

140
00:19:18,97 --> 00:19:29,17
Taking the five bar and making sure that nobody got in for nothing. Well around about half past ten comes.

141
00:19:30,33 --> 00:19:42,49
So I was a take and he says you fuckin white man. We're not paying you anymore I'm down my dad.

142
00:19:42,51 --> 00:19:53,71
And Barry stood in the door the entrance to the States and he said Now you know where. This is you think you are.

143
00:19:55,12 --> 00:20:02,8
I'm going in. Barry says no you're not. You're not and this went on and on and Barry wouldn't give an inch.

144
00:20:04,92 --> 00:20:15,32
I will never forget it ever. All the others compiled. Barry and so are you. And Shirley is waiting at the top of that.

145
00:20:15,34 --> 00:20:25,65
So he slips in behind a rambling hand Berry and shoots up I'm going to be turfed down again by Shirley's big.

146
00:20:25,67 --> 00:20:35,03
Then one day one of the here leaders his wife was Piggy. Said. We need more people at the end.

147
00:20:35,7 --> 00:20:42,94
I said you know I think they'd get a marvelous supper you know. All thrown in for. But I sent.

148
00:20:43,72 --> 00:20:46,18
She says you know marking the return people come about.

149
00:20:46,23 --> 00:21:01,02
We need them to come from apple green valley and black town and how do we do that. And she said to me I will call Joey.

150
00:21:01,22 --> 00:21:09,57
If you type and later for me. Culturally to bring his. Contribution to the.

151
00:21:10,87 --> 00:21:30,49
I didn't know who it was forty years fifty euro. Into a culturally must be something of a man.

152
00:21:30,74 --> 00:21:40,26
So we talked to him later and she took it into his office from where he was calm to show it came with this band.

153
00:21:41,44 --> 00:21:47,47
Where he couldn't like a drone we had to lock him in the kitchen.

154
00:21:48,72 --> 00:21:55,72
And I remember standing kitchen door and the young girls were trying to push it back together.

155
00:21:55,73 --> 00:22:02,00
With their little pieces of paper and pin so for autographs or what have you. We kept him there.

156
00:22:02,18 --> 00:22:08,09
Until he came in and it was an eye opener. Now I understand they don't want to rock is about.

157
00:22:08,55 --> 00:22:15,77
And why they go but he was a person who was loved by married women.

158
00:22:15,79 --> 00:22:27,81
He was very much sort of but when he walked onto the plane just weighed completely.

159
00:22:27,83 --> 00:22:33,39
One mad a lot of money that night because he wasn't letting everyone in.

160
00:22:33,4 --> 00:22:42,53
And I didn't tell you that you almost threw us. Anyhow I had just had to remember.

161
00:22:45,27 --> 00:22:51,81
And enriching evening so I had it lay with the people.

162
00:22:51,83 --> 00:23:00,84
I was doing state and it was going to be held on the Thursday before Easter.

163
00:23:01,4 --> 00:23:08,98
And I guess this would have been sixty five sixty six.

164
00:23:09,00 --> 00:23:17,02
And there were a lot of people on the footpath you know you sort of walked and got to be there. What have you.

165
00:23:20,3 --> 00:23:24,42
To pending work and came.

166
00:23:25,22 --> 00:23:31,68
And I was just going to babble all of these people into the tube and Jack Horner went out

167
00:23:35,58 --> 00:23:42,54
and the petty were going straight away. Then another man. There was a terrible fight out.

168
00:23:43,15 --> 00:23:47,32
And we were a bit worried about these two blokes who getting into each other.

169
00:23:47,41 --> 00:23:59,95
Look it just appeared like kill each other. And you're walked out and he started very badly and.

170
00:24:00,89 --> 00:24:11,94
The respectable dances. If you want to fight. I'm to the park. And you wouldn't believe. Karen.

171
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:18,03
Those two black stopped and I went down into the park to finish the fight and Ken said

172
00:24:18,03 --> 00:24:22,18
when I saw objects stand between the two men I thought they clearly.

173
00:24:22,62 --> 00:24:30,57
They didn't and that was what the respect was like for the little group of people.

174
00:24:30,59 --> 00:24:38,29
They knew who you were and I went away and they finished the fight in the park. And Carolyn.

175
00:24:39,62 --> 00:24:52,17
These were rich experiences in my life I was brought. Where my mom never so much as put a finger on not even a smack.

176
00:24:52,19 --> 00:24:57,56
If we did the wrong thing you should sit there and cry.

177
00:24:58,86 --> 00:25:08,65
And their interest for it was very foreign to me extremely far and I couldn't as a standard.

178
00:25:08,67 --> 00:25:21,53
And I guess that made me really great for China. What exactly for I wasn't quite sure. Certainly from our fundie.

179
00:25:21,88 --> 00:25:29,69
Change for. The federal government to become responsible for the people on the house.

180
00:25:31,9 --> 00:25:39,41
That there was also a need for a child. For the people to each other from each other and need for respect.

181
00:25:40,6 --> 00:25:49,65
And the sort of people who came to their stances Was there a mixture of everybody in it mainly Aboriginal people coming.

182
00:25:49,67 --> 00:25:59,02
Oh no. Why the Fellowship a point where there are sheep Yes and a few people who volunteered.

183
00:25:59,04 --> 00:26:06,2
There were all those people fern Aboriginal people and I knocked on these dances there's nobody else.

184
00:26:06,22 --> 00:26:15,46
And it was wonderful. Would get a whole lot of stuffed and aged to me in the way for a battle.

185
00:26:15,48 --> 00:26:24,29
And the every two women would come into the kitchen and Microsoft. Always sandwiches and big parts of tea.

186
00:26:25,17 --> 00:26:37,71
And it became a great social affair. It was a very important period. And I was greatly humbled that.

187
00:26:37,72 --> 00:26:49,36
And it made me fully realize what a very potent piece of history was happening really.

188
00:26:51,42 --> 00:26:54,34
People who are people who are thinking.

189
00:26:55,38 --> 00:27:01,73
People will be beginning to think about those kinds of people in the work community who made up the fellowship

190
00:27:01,73 --> 00:27:14,09
executive. The world that made me very few of the master spends ten or twelve we made security.

191
00:27:14,11 --> 00:27:27,31
Then came brindle who was dedicated to the family and all that we were doing was one of the leaders in Redfern. And.

192
00:27:27,33 --> 00:27:36,35
We'd get into Ken's house and Caroline Street. Posters for Ed you know.

193
00:27:36,37 --> 00:27:42,41
I'm coming back into the fellowship because that was a very important thing. That happened.

194
00:27:42,44 --> 00:27:49,12
The cops would just drive up to a person's house and arrest them for nothing.

195
00:27:50,06 --> 00:27:56,29
Now they would they did this to Kane because what. And.

196
00:27:57,24 --> 00:27:59,29
It would be two or three in the morning sometimes

197
00:27:59,29 --> 00:28:08,14
and my wife would ring who want to come on the police have taken care and when you come to the station.

198
00:28:08,55 --> 00:28:26,4
Me and I'd go and put houses. Few people now. And. Then there was a time when.

199
00:28:26,42 --> 00:28:38,94
Young a personal person young man was shot. DETECTIVE. For breaking allegedly breaking into a chaos and pinching.

200
00:28:40,62 --> 00:28:49,33
Cigarettes. And there was quite a disturbance in Redfern about this and great concern. And his mother.

201
00:28:49,34 --> 00:28:56,79
Rang and said look this is happened. And came to the police station and.

202
00:28:58,52 --> 00:29:06,17
What's the charge what if you knowing that you could ring up the fellowship if there was any trouble from.

203
00:29:06,93 --> 00:29:16,67
The cops will tell you what. And I beat him out. They didn't arrest him.

204
00:29:18,59 --> 00:29:25,17
But a detective got into him and I didn't care what anyone says positives that came got him to the detective as well.

205
00:29:26,83 --> 00:29:36,47
Well the law of the short of it is that Kane was charged for bashing up a cop. On a fellowship moved in quickly.

206
00:29:36,48 --> 00:29:47,59
And put up the Council for Civil liberty to take the case. And there in the court. Was this person.

207
00:29:48,73 --> 00:30:01,19
Defended one of brilliant barrister who's not bumps into. I think you miss a Q.C.

208
00:30:01,19 --> 00:30:08,07
At the time but I wouldn't say for sure. And it's a courtroom that would leave you with barristers.

209
00:30:08,55 --> 00:30:20,97
Middle class women in high hats and spiky gloves and. All the charges eventually were dismissed.

210
00:30:21,68 --> 00:30:29,35
But when the judge for some a nap. He said to the jury. Now I want you to remember.

211
00:30:30,77 --> 00:30:40,88
You are not awarding we were now suing for compensation.

212
00:30:40,89 --> 00:30:49,02
You are not awarding bad jockey or anyone like this you are awarding only an Aboriginal from richer.

213
00:30:49,04 --> 00:30:50,53
We got a few thousand dollars.

214
00:30:52,53 --> 00:30:57,76
Which would never have happened if it were not for the fellowship and the Council for Civil Liberties.

215
00:30:57,91 --> 00:30:58,81
She would leave it there.
