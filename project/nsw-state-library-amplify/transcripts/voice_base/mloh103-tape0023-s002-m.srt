1
00:00:14,82 --> 00:00:18,52
I've biggest success in. Technology
that this community is achieved.

2
00:00:18,62 --> 00:00:22,30
It's not so much that we've
got wonderful new brilliant.

3
00:00:22,32 --> 00:00:24,35
Energy systems going or anything like

4
00:00:24,35 --> 00:00:28,30
that we've got a few demonstration
projects to prove it's possible.

5
00:00:28,53 --> 00:00:33,85
We've got a big hydroelectric scheme we've
got my flying fox transport the things

6
00:00:33,85 --> 00:00:35,14
you can actually poke a stick at

7
00:00:35,14 --> 00:00:38,92
and say this is radical appropriate
such a soft technology

8
00:00:38,92 --> 00:00:43,91
but if you look at the statistics of the
whole communities lifestyle over the

9
00:00:43,91 --> 00:00:47,29
property what the only way
we really are winning.

10
00:00:47,49 --> 00:00:52,05
As far as the planets concerned is the
fact that we're not using nearly as much.

11
00:00:52,07 --> 00:00:54,91
We've got by with a lot less
servicing and we've found

12
00:00:54,91 --> 00:00:59,47
that it doesn't really matter all
that much. It's enough would have.

13
00:01:01,17 --> 00:01:05,21
In this community decision.

14
00:01:05,23 --> 00:01:11,18
And then. Someone either. Community or.

15
00:01:11,51 --> 00:01:17,76
Things or things. Well it was
always a bit of a nifty project.

16
00:01:18,88 --> 00:01:23,05
There was never enormous
push behind that project.

17
00:01:23,88 --> 00:01:28,89
Was buying more land there's
always been incredible push for.

18
00:01:28,90 --> 00:01:31,78
Cynically i'd say that's
because more dope growing land

19
00:01:31,78 --> 00:01:32,65
but that's not totally true.

20
00:01:33,27 --> 00:01:37,92
It's more the feeling of wishing to
consolidate people wishing for security

21
00:01:39,14 --> 00:01:43,22
and owning this whole valley
was a very important political

22
00:01:43,22 --> 00:01:46,53
and ideological strength
behind this community.

23
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:49,41
It meant that as a community
we had less neighbours.

24
00:01:50,98 --> 00:01:54,97
We hardly ever conflict out our direct
neighbours with different ideas.

25
00:01:55,54 --> 00:01:59,89
Other communities have great big legal
fights over pesticide spraying that.

26
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,30
Those over the fences and things like

27
00:02:01,30 --> 00:02:03,68
that because we own the
whole valley we don't have

28
00:02:03,68 --> 00:02:07,75
that on a couple of occasions fires of
come over the ridgeline from the neighbor

29
00:02:07,75 --> 00:02:09,86
and we've taken him to court.

30
00:02:11,76 --> 00:02:15,02
And a couple of occasions he's come
a log our logs over the border

31
00:02:15,77 --> 00:02:16,84
and were made a big fuss about it.

32
00:02:16,98 --> 00:02:23,59
So that's about the only interaction we've
had and we've been on very solid ground.

33
00:02:25,76 --> 00:02:28,95
What is happening.

34
00:02:29,98 --> 00:02:35,54
On him and wonderful for its tolerance.
Nimbin is a wonderfully tolerant place.

35
00:02:36,70 --> 00:02:39,00
It's one place like even in that.

36
00:02:39,69 --> 00:02:43,50
What i say that the black spots of
nimbin which is the rainbow cafe

37
00:02:43,50 --> 00:02:48,44
and the freemasons hotel the freemasons
hotel is my favourite hotel anywhere.

38
00:02:49,52 --> 00:02:52,99
It's usually full of appalling
music horrible looking people

39
00:02:54,03 --> 00:02:58,23
and people are blatantly using
drugs and drinking to excess.

40
00:02:58,78 --> 00:03:03,94
But never in my whole 20
years of going frequenting

41
00:03:03,94 --> 00:03:04,98
that place of i've been assaulted.

42
00:03:06,50 --> 00:03:13,38
I've drunk with totally obnoxious looking
bikies with undercover police with some

43
00:03:13,39 --> 00:03:18,00
of the most suspicious looking do you
be as people that you never see.

44
00:03:18,02 --> 00:03:21,36
And yet there is never a
threat to person. This it.

45
00:03:21,76 --> 00:03:27,57
A wonderful cosmopolitan thing in. That
different cultures that respected and.

46
00:03:28,99 --> 00:03:29,33
You feel

47
00:03:29,33 --> 00:03:32,53
that you could just about walk down the
street naked in fact i know someone who did

48
00:03:32,53 --> 00:03:35,05
and no one would take
the slightest notice.

49
00:03:35,99 --> 00:03:39,00
And yet it's also a place where you
know everybody and they know you.

50
00:03:39,62 --> 00:03:45,10
And if you desperate someone might
even lend you five dollars.

51
00:03:46,12 --> 00:03:52,19
You know so funny story.
Idea. I could go on.

52
00:03:53,88 --> 00:03:59,35
Yes.

53
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,68
Funny thing in the story. I
know i guess this doesn't.

54
00:04:03,31 --> 00:04:06,26
I'm sure this is legally ok to say so with

55
00:04:06,27 --> 00:04:11,35
that one of our ideological leaders during
their careers festival who was very keen

56
00:04:11,35 --> 00:04:12,88
on peace love and non-violence

57
00:04:12,88 --> 00:04:17,54
and his child conceived at the
aquarius festivals call softly.

58
00:04:17,56 --> 00:04:21,33
Turned into me the most
beautiful flower child.

59
00:04:21,34 --> 00:04:24,67
He actually.

60
00:04:25,50 --> 00:04:29,63
Assaulted one of my neighbors the still
ruler got dragged into court for it.

61
00:04:31,67 --> 00:04:35,77
And the only thing you could say after
being convicted was i should have hit him

62
00:04:35,77 --> 00:04:41,94
harder.

63
00:04:43,02 --> 00:04:49,44
Where the same fellow unfortunately got
must have irritated some bikies equally

64
00:04:49,44 --> 00:04:51,09
and they probably shot
him in the neck apps

65
00:04:51,09 --> 00:04:53,30
and left his body in the in the
quarry up the top of the hill.

66
00:04:53,68 --> 00:05:01,80
So i sort of had total sympathy.

67
00:05:03,70 --> 00:05:10,18
And i mean. Oh yes. And
most irritating man.

68
00:05:10,20 --> 00:05:14,75
Same time was it was a a oneness
with the environment that

69
00:05:14,75 --> 00:05:20,39
that man showed which is possibly
forgotten. Sometimes moonlight nights.

70
00:05:20,40 --> 00:05:24,82
You just come crashing out of the forest
obviously having walked five kilometres

71
00:05:24,82 --> 00:05:28,82
through the. Totally unknown untracked
bush in the middle of the night

72
00:05:29,84 --> 00:05:31,27
and had to have a wild fire

73
00:05:31,27 --> 00:05:37,11
and his eyes like he was like an animal
out of the forest and i could relate to

74
00:05:37,11 --> 00:05:38,51
that because part of the whole point.

75
00:05:38,73 --> 00:05:44,32
This is a community commune ality of all
the animals live in the forest a love the

76
00:05:44,32 --> 00:05:46,57
fact that all these animals just walk in

77
00:05:46,57 --> 00:05:50,92
and out of my house as if it's part
of the track which was always there.

78
00:05:50,93 --> 00:05:54,60
I just happen to build my house
at the joining of three tracks.

79
00:05:54,61 --> 00:05:58,42
And the animals treat it still as just
exactly what it was a meeting of those three

80
00:05:58,42 --> 00:05:58,65
tracks.

81
00:06:01,40 --> 00:06:07,88
That's very much so. Yes.

82
00:06:10,12 --> 00:06:12,93
I think. Yes.

83
00:06:14,19 --> 00:06:19,35
Well ever since i started taking
mushrooms i was very worried about what

84
00:06:20,91 --> 00:06:23,30
consciousness is what are we who are we.

85
00:06:24,09 --> 00:06:28,14
What's it all for all those
fundamental spiritual questions.

86
00:06:28,16 --> 00:06:31,65
And one of the things i came to us that
there wasn't any reason it just is

87
00:06:32,90 --> 00:06:37,03
and all animals that are are it
sounds semantically tautological

88
00:06:37,03 --> 00:06:40,88
but that's still the way i feel about these
animals that walk around the forest.

89
00:06:40,91 --> 00:06:41,42
They're no more

90
00:06:41,42 --> 00:06:47,69
and no less than i am so being
able to just go by in peace

91
00:06:47,69 --> 00:06:51,29
and have the the go
owners and push turkeys

92
00:06:51,29 --> 00:06:54,66
and all these amazing creatures
just come and look at me

93
00:06:54,66 --> 00:06:57,83
when i'm sitting there watching television
to me is that an amazing event.

94
00:07:01,72 --> 00:07:08,39
Because i think women. When.

95
00:07:10,56 --> 00:07:15,95
You know. I don't take it that far. I
don't think there's anything wrong.

96
00:07:16,06 --> 00:07:19,91
Squashing much flies fact i find it quite
amusing you squash them then you watch

97
00:07:19,91 --> 00:07:26,28
the lizards eat them.
The part of the cycle.

98
00:07:26,30 --> 00:07:30,80
So i'm not a buddhist in that sense.

99
00:07:30,82 --> 00:07:33,17
I've never formalized what
religious views i've had.

100
00:07:33,32 --> 00:07:37,05
Except that i don't believe in any
of them and none of it makes sense

101
00:07:37,05 --> 00:07:43,68
but i'm quite prepared to
leave it not making sense.

102
00:07:43,70 --> 00:07:48,29
Are strong. Yes of course everyone
must mention the difference.

103
00:07:49,55 --> 00:07:54,99
Most people tend to be buddhist in the
sense of valuing all life thinking that

104
00:07:55,68 --> 00:07:59,23
that the mountains the trees
everything has spirit which it does.

105
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,06
When the most beautiful spiritual times
he was walking around the valley by

106
00:08:03,06 --> 00:08:09,74
moonlight you feel like you're
you've come back to a primeval world

107
00:08:09,74 --> 00:08:13,73
beyond beforetime and it's the middle
of the day and you wearing sunglasses.

108
00:08:14,95 --> 00:08:17,78
That's the closest way i can express what
it's like to walk around this valley by

109
00:08:17,78 --> 00:08:19,68
moonlight. It's so quiet.

110
00:08:20,88 --> 00:08:25,17
You can hear a car for five kilometres
away easily you can even tell which car it

111
00:08:25,17 --> 00:08:30,75
is now that's under its imponderable
when you live in somewhere like sydney.

112
00:08:30,76 --> 00:08:34,10
Where you might hear a
siren three streets away

113
00:08:34,10 --> 00:08:39,17
and that's about it.

114
00:08:39,95 --> 00:08:46,17
Yes this valley is acoustically one
unit. And you smell things here.

115
00:08:46,32 --> 00:08:48,80
It's got wonderful smell. It's got.

116
00:08:48,82 --> 00:08:54,36
Beautiful sounds everyone mentions at night
time walking around here can hear all

117
00:08:54,36 --> 00:09:01,12
of the birds the different sorts of owls
night jars the you can hear things going

118
00:09:01,12 --> 00:09:03,04
on and wallabies hopping around.

119
00:09:05,29 --> 00:09:10,93
It's like it's a whole world happening that
just there aren't people dominating it.

120
00:09:13,10 --> 00:09:17,14
We just one more night
animal walking around.

121
00:09:18,56 --> 00:09:25,13
I think. Important.

122
00:09:25,67 --> 00:09:29,65
Are music was almost a driving
force in this culture.

123
00:09:30,16 --> 00:09:34,68
This aquarian culture we had the
protest movement we had bob dylan.

124
00:09:34,70 --> 00:09:38,19
Joan baez all of those people and
they really created the dream.

125
00:09:38,62 --> 00:09:44,38
I mentioned before broke celtic infusion
rock. But it's also the ballad.

126
00:09:44,95 --> 00:09:50,11
You get people. Joan baez
thing the thing about.

127
00:09:50,13 --> 00:09:54,17
Like the circle song as one of the
classic it's about the circle of life.

128
00:09:54,76 --> 00:09:59,19
And one of the key lines
about the boy. If cut will.

129
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,43
Change the car wheels through the
town and then the next person.

130
00:10:03,95 --> 00:10:08,38
And his dreams of lost their
grandeur coming through.

131
00:10:08,40 --> 00:10:12,34
I see a lot of the people around me feeling
a little bit sort of jaded about the

132
00:10:12,34 --> 00:10:16,30
tunnel experience and it sometimes
feels a bit like a holiday camp

133
00:10:16,30 --> 00:10:21,21
or so much like a beach place
where people go to retire and die

134
00:10:22,50 --> 00:10:25,22
but i think partly it's because
the dreams that come true.

135
00:10:26,38 --> 00:10:27,28
They've lost their grandeur

136
00:10:28,04 --> 00:10:32,37
and it's all sort of worn off a bit
because sometimes it's not the reality of

137
00:10:32,37 --> 00:10:33,15
what's happened but the way

138
00:10:33,15 --> 00:10:40,79
that people feel about it which affects
the way they talk about it so.

139
00:10:40,81 --> 00:10:48,15
I feel at the same inspirational creating
a new vision thing which has been.

140
00:10:48,17 --> 00:10:52,90
Like the led zeppelin song. Stairway
to heaven. That was one of the.

141
00:10:53,36 --> 00:10:58,08
The hymns of our movement
and everyone can play

142
00:10:59,44 --> 00:11:00,52
that song on the guitar

143
00:11:00,52 --> 00:11:04,72
but it's just one of the sort of
rites of passage in this community.

144
00:11:06,32 --> 00:11:08,59
And the the forest will
echo with laughter.

145
00:11:08,80 --> 00:11:11,26
If one of the most amazing lines
in the middle of that song

146
00:11:14,07 --> 00:11:17,30
and funny because it brings together the
two elements of this culture which i've

147
00:11:17,30 --> 00:11:19,51
always found contradictory ones

148
00:11:19,52 --> 00:11:25,36
that the forest echoing the laughter the
silence on the other hand the incredible

149
00:11:25,36 --> 00:11:31,32
noise with which most people play music
around here right from beginning bobby

150
00:11:31,32 --> 00:11:34,62
craven scalp sales down there which was the
nearest point to sell atrocity we could

151
00:11:34,62 --> 00:11:38,28
plug in a thousand what amplifier
was booming and shaking

152
00:11:38,28 --> 00:11:42,41
and shocking the whole valley with
really quite miserable doors type rock

153
00:11:42,41 --> 00:11:46,74
and roll and all the concerts around here.

154
00:11:47,03 --> 00:11:49,67
I couldn't relate to culture at all
until i learned to wear earplugs

155
00:11:50,83 --> 00:11:54,98
and now before i go into any constant
round here i plug up my years with toilet

156
00:11:54,98 --> 00:11:58,64
paper and you simply have to
try the few reasons i think

157
00:11:58,64 --> 00:12:01,85
that i've got still my hearing. Was
many people around here are quite deaf.

158
00:12:02,45 --> 00:12:07,21
It's one of the. My theories about the
communication between people and.

159
00:12:07,52 --> 00:12:08,67
Extremely simple.

160
00:12:09,84 --> 00:12:15,19
People don't communicate because half the
people are too stoned to talk coherently

161
00:12:15,19 --> 00:12:17,92
in the other half to death to hear.

162
00:12:18,68 --> 00:12:22,98
And you know i think that the communications
the lifeblood of any community

163
00:12:22,98 --> 00:12:31,86
and we're not doing enough.

164
00:12:31,88 --> 00:12:36,70
Well that's work to our
favor. We've collected. Yes.

165
00:12:37,78 --> 00:12:40,85
The burden of being seen
as a visionary center.

166
00:12:41,17 --> 00:12:44,47
As wonderful for example
my immediate neighborhood.

167
00:12:44,50 --> 00:12:48,09
There's now a totally rip up you lated
on the only person who was there in the

168
00:12:48,09 --> 00:12:52,32
original hamlet. Although people
have come a germans except one.

169
00:12:52,33 --> 00:12:59,20
Tony was not electrician from up in queensland.
But all of the others are germans.

170
00:12:59,22 --> 00:13:01,73
Germans know more about
nimbin than australians do.

171
00:13:01,79 --> 00:13:07,82
It's considered a mecca for anti-authoritarian
forces when they call themselves.

172
00:13:07,84 --> 00:13:10,36
Junkies or anarchists or what
a doesn't really matter.

173
00:13:10,45 --> 00:13:13,20
The point is they're anti-the state and.

174
00:13:13,58 --> 00:13:18,09
They've been over inspected over defected
over everything in germany by an

175
00:13:18,09 --> 00:13:19,76
excessively efficient public service.

176
00:13:20,34 --> 00:13:24,95
They come here to escape it as he opposite
point of the globe as the opposite end

177
00:13:24,95 --> 00:13:29,28
culturally and for that reason we've got
all these wonderful immigrant germans.

178
00:13:29,90 --> 00:13:33,14
Who are skilled. Ambitious.

179
00:13:33,15 --> 00:13:35,71
Old enough and have the
wherewithal to be constructive

180
00:13:36,99 --> 00:13:41,86
and my whole neighborhood has been totally
rebuilt in a wonderful way by the

181
00:13:41,86 --> 00:13:43,58
ingress of all is wonderful germans.

182
00:13:44,84 --> 00:13:51,50
So it's attracted a lot of negative
attention from government bureaucracies.

183
00:13:52,39 --> 00:13:57,81
For example if i win i get regularly stopped
because i drive an old car they were

184
00:13:57,81 --> 00:14:01,06
slick my license. And the fact

185
00:14:01,06 --> 00:14:03,52
that the license has the wrong
gender doesn't seem to bother them.

186
00:14:03,65 --> 00:14:08,15
What bothers them is that as the word
tangible falls they promptly get out

187
00:14:08,15 --> 00:14:09,57
and start searching the car for marijuana.

188
00:14:11,14 --> 00:14:15,57
The image of the place has got a lot
of attention unwanted for both police

189
00:14:15,57 --> 00:14:20,36
and drug traffickers in general
it was beautifully ambiguous

190
00:14:23,08 --> 00:14:29,03
but yes it's it's been also a wonderful
drawcard we've got an unbelievable string

191
00:14:29,03 --> 00:14:31,72
of talented wonderful people
come to this property.

192
00:14:32,56 --> 00:14:35,21
Most of whom we've used
poorly and consumed

193
00:14:35,21 --> 00:14:39,29
and spat out my biggest guilt about this
community is how poorly we've served many

194
00:14:39,29 --> 00:14:44,90
of the very talented ideal it ideologically
motivated people because what's

195
00:14:44,90 --> 00:14:49,34
happened this community is built
of the cream and the dregs.

196
00:14:50,24 --> 00:14:54,03
They both come together where unselective
and often i'm not quite sure.

197
00:14:54,05 --> 00:14:57,32
Sometimes which category
to put people in is not

198
00:14:57,32 --> 00:14:59,96
that i'm being touched mental
it's just simply the fact

199
00:14:59,96 --> 00:15:03,37
that people come here sometimes
for their own purposes

200
00:15:03,38 --> 00:15:09,25
and sometimes the community purposes just
occasionally enlightened self-interest

201
00:15:09,25 --> 00:15:14,19
makes them serve both masters.

202
00:15:14,21 --> 00:15:19,33
Ok. Riot.

203
00:15:20,85 --> 00:15:26,53
My name is sally spain and i came to
nimbin. In 1976 one hundred seventy six.

204
00:15:27,83 --> 00:15:31,45
And i've lived here on
and off since then on

205
00:15:31,46 --> 00:15:34,56
and off because some of the
time i go over the border.

206
00:15:35,47 --> 00:15:38,16
The aborigines used to call this
country the country of the men

207
00:15:38,16 --> 00:15:39,94
and they sent of the ceremonies.

208
00:15:40,53 --> 00:15:41,62
On mount warning

209
00:15:41,62 --> 00:15:45,72
and the terrain here is rougher than where
i grew up which is just over the border

210
00:15:45,72 --> 00:15:49,85
in south east queensland which
catwalk at once told me.

211
00:15:49,86 --> 00:15:54,28
Was with stradbroke island and and mount
turnberry in the country of the women

212
00:15:55,18 --> 00:15:56,59
and i find that the values

213
00:15:56,59 --> 00:15:59,93
that are expressed in both of these
places one on each side of the ball.

214
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,58
Yeah part and parcel of the same thing.

215
00:16:02,69 --> 00:16:06,87
I don't know how many people would agree
with me because a lot of the people who

216
00:16:06,87 --> 00:16:08,12
came to nimbin

217
00:16:09,27 --> 00:16:13,12
and some of them with the very best
of our generation came from sydney

218
00:16:13,12 --> 00:16:19,57
and in those days we had because of the
hard work of our parents generation a lot

219
00:16:19,57 --> 00:16:25,06
of freedom to discuss and talk about
the ideas and out of the universities

220
00:16:25,06 --> 00:16:29,27
and the colleges and the
workplaces there came a feeling

221
00:16:29,27 --> 00:16:31,83
that it would be good in in
view of some of the crises

222
00:16:31,83 --> 00:16:36,49
that seem to be be setting the world
to set up an ideal society and young

223
00:16:36,49 --> 00:16:40,24
and naive as we were i think we
expected to walk out of the country

224
00:16:40,24 --> 00:16:44,12
and set one up just like that
of course 20 years later

225
00:16:44,12 --> 00:16:49,01
when people talk about it that's
fine. Yeah i'm sorry. Yeah sure.

226
00:16:49,18 --> 00:16:51,74
Of course 20 years later
when people talk about it.

227
00:16:51,78 --> 00:16:52,71
They see the vision

228
00:16:52,71 --> 00:16:55,83
and they also see some of the disappointments
as well as some of the things

229
00:16:55,83 --> 00:16:58,64
that have been achieved. I
think in our generation

230
00:16:59,42 --> 00:17:02,92
and the generations later on haven't had
such total freedom because of the economic

231
00:17:02,92 --> 00:17:04,40
times that came upon us.

232
00:17:05,38 --> 00:17:08,11
We had an opportunity to
express some of the things

233
00:17:08,11 --> 00:17:12,38
that we believed in which was like
a whole lifestyle with with trust

234
00:17:12,38 --> 00:17:16,18
and friendship with people and
some connection to the earth again

235
00:17:16,18 --> 00:17:19,17
and a rural community fresh air

236
00:17:19,17 --> 00:17:24,21
and freedom to bring up our children
perhaps in a way outside of the city areas

237
00:17:24,21 --> 00:17:24,78
and so on

238
00:17:25,69 --> 00:17:30,29
and i think in a lot of cases some of
this has been achieved in other cases it

239
00:17:30,29 --> 00:17:34,64
hasn't because people have got sidetracked
drugs were a problem with our generation

240
00:17:34,64 --> 00:17:35,75
and there were other issues too.

241
00:17:36,07 --> 00:17:37,16
But nimbin

242
00:17:37,16 --> 00:17:40,97
and in a way has been a learning centre
many more people than are actually here now

243
00:17:40,97 --> 00:17:42,29
have passed by

244
00:17:42,29 --> 00:17:46,23
and some of them have learnt difficult
lessons here because it wasn't easy to come

245
00:17:46,23 --> 00:17:51,71
from at least a semi urban lifestyle and
suddenly plant oneself in a rural area

246
00:17:53,02 --> 00:17:55,99
but some of the people who have
come here have found friendship.

247
00:17:56,66 --> 00:17:59,86
I think from some of them
found disappointment also.

248
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,81
Because of course the vision couldn't
always be immediately realized

249
00:18:03,81 --> 00:18:06,69
or even ever realized
perhaps but it doesn't mean

250
00:18:06,69 --> 00:18:09,72
that a lot of the people here
haven't held on to the principles

251
00:18:09,72 --> 00:18:13,06
that they espoused when they
when they dropped out of

252
00:18:13,06 --> 00:18:16,89
that was what it was called in those days.
That's all i can think of right now.

253
00:18:18,07 --> 00:18:20,48
The insular. Community.

254
00:18:22,97 --> 00:18:27,10
You know i think probably we did some partly
that's contributed to by the terrain i

255
00:18:27,10 --> 00:18:30,82
mean in a sense. We're doing both
things because we live in queensland

256
00:18:30,82 --> 00:18:32,13
and my husband works

257
00:18:32,13 --> 00:18:38,42
and we've got our children now at school
so i taught them in the early years. But.

258
00:18:38,43 --> 00:18:41,17
To a degree. We've got
we've got rough terrain

259
00:18:41,17 --> 00:18:44,60
and to walk across to our
neighbours there is something

260
00:18:44,60 --> 00:18:47,93
that you can't really do because you've
got to sort of hack your way through

261
00:18:47,93 --> 00:18:52,16
or go right round via a long way
and i think just dealing with.

262
00:18:52,75 --> 00:18:56,87
Planting orchards and building houses and
looking after children it might mean

263
00:18:56,87 --> 00:18:59,91
that people don't associate but
in other ways i think they do

264
00:18:59,91 --> 00:19:03,52
when i was here more full time. And
the little school was down there.

265
00:19:03,61 --> 00:19:05,72
The children would visit the kindergarten.

266
00:19:05,74 --> 00:19:08,29
And i would go down and be part
of the committee of the school

267
00:19:08,29 --> 00:19:09,75
and i think through group endeavors.

268
00:19:09,92 --> 00:19:13,81
People get a lot of their social life
where they might hop skip across to a

269
00:19:13,81 --> 00:19:16,89
neighbour because of the
actual nature of the terrain.

270
00:19:16,93 --> 00:19:21,47
I don't know if that
answers your question.

271
00:19:22,31 --> 00:19:27,59
Down. Sure i think that's right.

272
00:19:27,80 --> 00:19:32,01
And that's what we were talking about before
i think if you have a community where

273
00:19:32,02 --> 00:19:35,92
it's group life then you make some
sacrifices to be part of the group

274
00:19:35,92 --> 00:19:41,03
and sometimes that's that's individually
an individuality and sometimes.

275
00:19:41,05 --> 00:19:43,51
That means that you have to
be able to group pressures

276
00:19:43,51 --> 00:19:47,31
and sometimes the group is wrong.
So there's always that danger.

277
00:19:47,65 --> 00:19:51,30
I mean sometimes it's correct you get
some energy from people being different

278
00:19:51,30 --> 00:19:52,34
and you're free to be different.

279
00:19:52,39 --> 00:19:54,99
Amongst them and who express
what you felt you should express

280
00:19:55,74 --> 00:19:59,95
but on the other hand there is there is
tyranny by the group and i think the.

281
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,27
What can happen to. And that's
something that that would bother me.

282
00:20:04,36 --> 00:20:07,26
I think in a way because i tend to
relate to people on an individual level.

283
00:20:07,48 --> 00:20:09,15
So i found beautiful friends here.

284
00:20:09,75 --> 00:20:12,94
But but i avoid the tribal
meetings because it bothers me

285
00:20:12,94 --> 00:20:16,85
that some decision can be made and perhaps
that's an unjust decision not always

286
00:20:16,85 --> 00:20:23,28
but it can. Been.

287
00:20:23,30 --> 00:20:38,40
A reflection.

288
00:20:39,62 --> 00:20:43,37
I mean just you know reflection.

289
00:20:43,39 --> 00:20:47,16
You know i think there are things
there are there are great lessons

290
00:20:47,16 --> 00:20:48,66
that can be learnt from
what's happened here.

291
00:20:48,91 --> 00:20:51,68
But there's also with every step forward.

292
00:20:51,70 --> 00:20:55,08
Sometimes i think there's a step backwards
i mean people here are more conscious of

293
00:20:55,08 --> 00:20:59,12
a healthy lifestyle and they are more
conscious of having organic food

294
00:20:59,89 --> 00:21:02,21
but because they they
landed in a rain for us.

295
00:21:02,25 --> 00:21:03,52
Sometimes hygiene

296
00:21:03,52 --> 00:21:07,36
and sanitation was slack whereas if you
if you went up to the coast where the

297
00:21:07,36 --> 00:21:11,21
council had more control in the hinterland
there. So notation was all right.

298
00:21:11,24 --> 00:21:12,85
But people might not realize so much about

299
00:21:12,85 --> 00:21:16,18
that their alternative ways of dealing
with health problems and things like

300
00:21:16,18 --> 00:21:19,01
that it was it was always very dualistic.

301
00:21:19,66 --> 00:21:24,34
That's what i found i mean if i breastfed
the children here publicly to a late age

302
00:21:24,34 --> 00:21:28,64
that was never a problem. If i did it
up there you know over the border.

303
00:21:28,67 --> 00:21:31,07
That was more conspicuous.

304
00:21:31,09 --> 00:21:35,71
But if i fed the children sweets down here
which i think is perfectly correct then

305
00:21:35,71 --> 00:21:38,33
that might be a cause of some
neighbourly interference.

306
00:21:38,55 --> 00:21:41,02
If i fed them sweets up
there. That was no problem.

307
00:21:41,75 --> 00:21:43,69
It was like that always i
always had that experience.

308
00:21:44,20 --> 00:21:45,60
If i birth the children at home.

309
00:21:46,05 --> 00:21:49,03
Up there which i did because
our house wasn't finished here

310
00:21:49,03 --> 00:21:51,72
and my mother was up there
she was a midwife then

311
00:21:51,72 --> 00:21:54,76
that wasn't a problem here
people so the home birth is fine

312
00:21:55,45 --> 00:21:58,82
and in those days i had i had no feeling
of going there a hospital i had three

313
00:21:58,82 --> 00:22:00,30
healthy children. But.

314
00:22:00,71 --> 00:22:04,04
But if i if i was home birthing
up there people would would say.

315
00:22:04,11 --> 00:22:06,02
Good heavens how unguarded of you.

316
00:22:06,08 --> 00:22:10,49
So i always had this experience of
living between but not so much.

317
00:22:10,70 --> 00:22:13,95
Now i think that some of the ideas
that were that were current and

318
00:22:13,95 --> 00:22:17,69
that were good ideas that came
here have spread widely so that

319
00:22:17,69 --> 00:22:18,73
when i say to my cousins.

320
00:22:18,75 --> 00:22:23,49
Look you don't have to come up here to
see if you've been being true to the

321
00:22:23,49 --> 00:22:26,72
traditions the australian traditions
of of looking after your children

322
00:22:26,72 --> 00:22:29,45
and having basic morality and giving them.

323
00:22:29,61 --> 00:22:33,32
You know a healthy lifestyle and keeping
them in touch with nature then that

324
00:22:33,32 --> 00:22:36,16
when i different to them. I
mean it's not so different now.

325
00:22:36,36 --> 00:22:47,99
So much.

326
00:22:48,01 --> 00:22:52,58
Whereas i don't know i draw a lot of
strength from beautiful people who are here.

327
00:22:52,85 --> 00:22:56,51
You know that have come i mean i've
met some extraordinary souls here.

328
00:22:57,09 --> 00:22:58,41
Who came you know with.

329
00:22:58,92 --> 00:23:02,07
Most beautiful ideas and
managed to manifest them but

330
00:23:03,32 --> 00:23:07,61
but also i mean we had people who were
travelling through who were who are you know

331
00:23:07,61 --> 00:23:08,15
out of it.

332
00:23:09,40 --> 00:23:13,19
Who had had had too many drugs who are
difficult to deal with we've had both very

333
00:23:13,19 --> 00:23:16,24
extreme. And they've been more
free to express themselves here

334
00:23:16,24 --> 00:23:17,13
and i would have in other places

335
00:23:18,29 --> 00:23:21,80
but i don't draw so much from the
group life as a whole that i did

336
00:23:21,80 --> 00:23:23,53
when the children were
going to the kindergartens

337
00:23:23,53 --> 00:23:25,96
when it was very much a group
parent sort of endeavor.

338
00:23:26,51 --> 00:23:31,07
But i do draw from from the people who
felt to come here some friendships.

339
00:23:31,34 --> 00:23:33,31
So i guess that's the way out

340
00:23:33,31 --> 00:23:36,45
but that's just i think that's to
do with my personality too i'm.

341
00:23:36,63 --> 00:23:40,35
I don't know i wouldn't have life didn't
like school or large groups very much.

342
00:23:40,38 --> 00:23:43,70
Anyway in the first place so it
seems odd to have come to a commune

343
00:23:43,70 --> 00:23:49,49
but there are.

344
00:23:52,83 --> 00:23:59,74
Extreme.

345
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,10
I think it can be.

346
00:24:01,14 --> 00:24:05,02
Yes i've seen good people who've had
good ideas and have been harassed

347
00:24:05,02 --> 00:24:07,63
and criticized for them and who've left

348
00:24:07,63 --> 00:24:10,74
and i've seen good strong people who've
managed to put their point of view on have

349
00:24:10,74 --> 00:24:15,11
stayed. I think because we
were such a loud generation.

350
00:24:15,23 --> 00:24:20,29
Everybody had their opinions and
some of them were very good but that

351
00:24:20,30 --> 00:24:23,45
that cause people conflict i
think that that's sort of thing

352
00:24:23,45 --> 00:24:26,71
and also also i've seen
incredible wisdom in people

353
00:24:26,72 --> 00:24:28,48
and managing to deal with other people

354
00:24:28,48 --> 00:24:32,70
and to to draw on experiences to to
know themselves more and to mature.

355
00:24:32,80 --> 00:24:37,29
I've seen both really i've seen
people who are deluded and still are.

356
00:24:38,18 --> 00:24:41,12
And i've seen people
who've who've realised.

357
00:24:41,14 --> 00:24:44,07
Well what it comes down
to an end which is that

358
00:24:44,07 --> 00:24:47,84
that their god consciousness if you like
the fact that god created the planet

359
00:24:47,84 --> 00:24:50,87
and that they've said they're here to
care for it and to care for other people.

360
00:24:50,89 --> 00:24:52,95
I've seen people reach that that stage

361
00:24:52,95 --> 00:24:57,14
and i've seen people miss it
completely both actually.

362
00:24:58,20 --> 00:25:04,50
Right. Which is.

363
00:25:04,52 --> 00:25:07,72
You know but it probably did me
good. I certainly was challenged.

364
00:25:07,80 --> 00:25:09,25
I mean we had thousands of people.

365
00:25:09,28 --> 00:25:12,64
It seemed like coming through here before
the house was built the early days were

366
00:25:12,64 --> 00:25:16,16
pretty hectic i had little
children and all the things

367
00:25:16,16 --> 00:25:18,94
that other people dealt with no
water and things like that at first

368
00:25:18,94 --> 00:25:19,84
that kind of stuff

369
00:25:20,61 --> 00:25:25,30
but i had it easier than some because i
did go across the board across the border

370
00:25:25,30 --> 00:25:27,71
so that they were
co-parenting by my mother

371
00:25:27,71 --> 00:25:32,12
and david had work to do sometimes up
there so we were coming back and forth.

372
00:25:32,14 --> 00:25:34,81
Some people had it harder than
that. You know that's true.

373
00:25:37,62 --> 00:25:40,81
But on the other hand i think some
people i hopefully i feel at that

374
00:25:40,81 --> 00:25:45,72
that they drew drew support from the
group in their hard times more would you

375
00:25:45,72 --> 00:25:52,02
reckon that's right. Yeah well you get
both. That's right. Yeah and it's tricky.

376
00:25:52,06 --> 00:25:55,94
It's painful when you get somebody
good sizing i mean i married david

377
00:25:55,94 --> 00:25:59,37
and came here and i didn't agree with
that rule that there should be no dogs.

378
00:25:59,45 --> 00:25:59,93
I can.

379
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:02,88
Understand people's logic behind it
because there are lots of paddy melons

380
00:26:02,88 --> 00:26:03,46
and stuff like that

381
00:26:03,46 --> 00:26:07,02
but i never would have come to a
community where there weren't dogs.

382
00:26:07,15 --> 00:26:10,90
So when i tried to bring dogs in
and just followed my feelings on

383
00:26:10,90 --> 00:26:15,01
that because i really think that that
people and animals should be close.

384
00:26:15,03 --> 00:26:18,63
I think that's why christ was born
in a stable to show that the animals

385
00:26:18,63 --> 00:26:21,96
and people are meant to be close
and we had the sort of dogs

386
00:26:21,96 --> 00:26:25,07
that didn't chase paddy melons but i
got into a lot of conflict there and

387
00:26:25,07 --> 00:26:28,77
that was hurtful but it is i suppose
that happens in any walk of life

388
00:26:28,77 --> 00:26:33,76
and to a degree. You know although perhaps
we were more overt about it here.

389
00:26:33,95 --> 00:26:38,58
I don't know perhaps that's oh yeah.

390
00:26:40,17 --> 00:26:45,78
You know. And you know that's right.

391
00:26:45,95 --> 00:26:47,95
And this is that's what
david says my husband.

392
00:26:48,35 --> 00:26:51,98
This is the the biggest land cooperative
where people have come together

393
00:26:51,98 --> 00:26:54,29
and that's one of these donnish
only good things about it

394
00:26:54,29 --> 00:26:57,79
that you said once the fact that
people with a tiny bit of capital

395
00:26:57,79 --> 00:27:01,07
and we were lucky because from
david's father we had more capital

396
00:27:01,07 --> 00:27:03,32
and other people to set up fruit
trees and to help build a house

397
00:27:04,23 --> 00:27:07,21
but for people with small amount of
capital they can get access to land

398
00:27:07,97 --> 00:27:11,68
and the land has always been locked
in australia from earliest times

399
00:27:11,68 --> 00:27:15,18
and so that's that that was very
important that was revolutionary

400
00:27:15,18 --> 00:27:20,10
and that's something that should
be observed on the other hand

401
00:27:20,10 --> 00:27:24,54
that had probably problems too because
we where we are here were insulated by a

402
00:27:24,54 --> 00:27:27,51
creek and it and the forest at the back

403
00:27:27,51 --> 00:27:31,49
but some people who might have had such a
strong personality might have got pushed

404
00:27:31,49 --> 00:27:33,09
more into a corner in earlier times

405
00:27:33,09 --> 00:27:37,35
and not been allowed to have so much
land as somebody else who was because it

406
00:27:37,35 --> 00:27:39,08
wasn't all set up with
rules and regulations.

407
00:27:39,16 --> 00:27:43,53
I think since going to land cooperatives
made it more fair by trying to make it

408
00:27:43,53 --> 00:27:49,31
spelt out at the beginning. Who
could be where and what they had.

409
00:27:50,74 --> 00:27:53,52
No. Right.

410
00:27:54,70 --> 00:28:01,25
Yeah. Because it. I haven't seen it.

411
00:28:02,65 --> 00:28:06,51
Is that right. What you're talking
about there is anarchy isn't it.

412
00:28:06,60 --> 00:28:08,85
And that that's the
spirit. That's in heaven.

413
00:28:08,86 --> 00:28:12,22
I mean if everybody who had come
here had had that heavenly vision

414
00:28:12,22 --> 00:28:13,97
or had managed to hang onto it.

415
00:28:14,12 --> 00:28:18,09
Then you wouldn't have ever had
any problem and a lot of them did

416
00:28:19,06 --> 00:28:24,28
but also it was very quickly earth with
with a lot of disputes which i guess work

417
00:28:24,29 --> 00:28:28,84
had to happen in the physical
reality but but that

418
00:28:28,84 --> 00:28:31,01
that heavenly vision i
don't have any doubt

419
00:28:33,02 --> 00:28:36,16
that people had had it's
really strange but i follow.

420
00:28:36,26 --> 00:28:38,21
I follow the strategy and

421
00:28:38,21 --> 00:28:43,36
and our generation was a leo generation
that's why they were such argumentative

422
00:28:43,37 --> 00:28:49,09
talkers. But they also had their
leo was in pisces which is

423
00:28:49,09 --> 00:28:52,63
that which is the sign of the person
who's at their old stage of life

424
00:28:52,63 --> 00:28:56,48
and has a heavenly vision as well as an
earthly vision that's while people sit

425
00:28:56,48 --> 00:29:01,91
and dream there and heaven away. And so
we got our heavenly vision at that age.

426
00:29:02,19 --> 00:29:04,94
Some people get it at a different age and.

427
00:29:05,50 --> 00:29:09,51
Everybody has their chance i think
to do to envision something of that

428
00:29:10,38 --> 00:29:16,00
that christ like thing on the earth
and i think people did have that

429
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:19,13
but of course you know the
earth is not perfect.

430
00:29:21,63 --> 00:29:23,40
So some of the things that
were done were perfect

431
00:29:23,40 --> 00:29:25,28
and some of them weren't that's about it

432
00:29:26,66 --> 00:29:30,89
that keeps coming under the same point.

433
00:29:30,91 --> 00:29:42,00
Right.

434
00:29:42,94 --> 00:29:47,48
Yes i think that's probably too i
meant true if we had a fine education

435
00:29:47,48 --> 00:29:51,13
and i know we had a lot of
skills from that but i know

436
00:29:51,13 --> 00:29:57,43
that also we had more than a lot of other
generations experience of classrooms to a

437
00:29:57,43 --> 00:29:59,87
very late age especially the
ones who were not deterred.

438
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:02,86
Three institutions and i know
that the early days and then

439
00:30:02,86 --> 00:30:05,63
and were partly a childhood
that was played out.

440
00:30:05,74 --> 00:30:08,97
I mean there was a lot of fun people
people didn't have no clothes

441
00:30:08,97 --> 00:30:12,13
and they did walk all over the place
and dance and sing i mean there was

442
00:30:12,13 --> 00:30:15,60
that crazy sort of summer of of of.

443
00:30:16,12 --> 00:30:21,01
Just an innocence in a way i mean that
that brought its problems to but.

444
00:30:21,02 --> 00:30:24,73
But in a way that that was a childhood
that some people had never had

445
00:30:24,73 --> 00:30:30,17
that they dropped out to to enjoy and and
as always happens that their people.

446
00:30:30,27 --> 00:30:32,74
If they don't go through a
certain stage of got to do it.

447
00:30:32,79 --> 00:30:36,49
Later and a lot of people
had a freedom then.

448
00:30:36,50 --> 00:30:36,96
That was

449
00:30:36,96 --> 00:30:40,36
that was very beautiful it was it was a
celebration there were some very good

450
00:30:40,36 --> 00:30:44,08
things. That. The people
enjoyed in terms of.

451
00:30:45,60 --> 00:30:54,26
Just just being free for a while.

452
00:30:54,27 --> 00:30:59,07
As well. People are no longer young.
I guess and it's not appropriate.

453
00:30:59,61 --> 00:31:02,57
I don't think to try and
call that that back.

454
00:31:02,76 --> 00:31:06,82
That was a special time i mean there are
echoes of it all around but i think that.

455
00:31:07,38 --> 00:31:08,62
That was a time that was given

456
00:31:08,62 --> 00:31:12,19
and then you're supposed to get
the messages from your time

457
00:31:12,19 --> 00:31:16,93
and realize the things that you dreamt of
so i don't think that that's appropriate.

458
00:31:17,19 --> 00:31:18,47
Now but it was appropriate.

459
00:31:18,74 --> 00:31:22,41
Then it was a very special freedom and
they were very special friendships.

460
00:31:23,08 --> 00:31:23,59
And

461
00:31:24,56 --> 00:31:30,18
and of course many previous generations
had been too tightly control

462
00:31:30,18 --> 00:31:32,51
and sexual morality comes into that.
