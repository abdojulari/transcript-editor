1
00:00:10,32 --> 00:00:14,38
Military. Take on you.

2
00:00:16,83 --> 00:00:18,19
And. I know.

3
00:00:18,30 --> 00:00:25,84
Where it's raining.

4
00:00:25,86 --> 00:00:30,06
Well i think i can consider myself an
old timer. You want to say my name.

5
00:00:31,19 --> 00:00:32,04
I'm not nicholson

6
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:37,07
and i think i can consider myself an old
timer now in this area which is a chain

7
00:00:37,07 --> 00:00:39,45
and in an area although i
think you have to be here

8
00:00:39,45 --> 00:00:42,28
but 60 years before you
consider the true blue oldtimer

9
00:00:42,28 --> 00:00:46,08
but having been here for almost 20 years.

10
00:00:46,10 --> 00:00:48,99
I consider myself a veteran
of a number of battles.

11
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:54,89
I've been living on the one property for
most of those almost 20 years trying to

12
00:00:54,89 --> 00:00:59,50
make a go out of living on the land running
a nursery having some kids maintaining

13
00:00:59,50 --> 00:01:03,25
a relationship which is a fulltime job
in itself fighting for the local forests

14
00:01:03,25 --> 00:01:08,83
and staying involved in a lot of other
issues and doing university study

15
00:01:08,83 --> 00:01:12,77
and a lot of other study as well and
trying to maintain my intelligence.

16
00:01:14,42 --> 00:01:20,12
Despite a few problems with
work overload and so on. What.

17
00:01:22,90 --> 00:01:26,01
I think you have to admit for a start
it's the ascetics you can't help being

18
00:01:26,01 --> 00:01:28,23
affected by the place
when you walk into it.

19
00:01:29,25 --> 00:01:29,85
But it's not just

20
00:01:29,85 --> 00:01:34,62
that i think it's the sense of the
fragility in the face of human onslaughts

21
00:01:35,46 --> 00:01:35,95
and in itself.

22
00:01:36,09 --> 00:01:39,88
It's not fragile because it's been
around for roughly 100 million years.

23
00:01:39,96 --> 00:01:42,50
So we know it's extremely durable.

24
00:01:43,46 --> 00:01:46,27
That's withstood a number of
very dramatic climate changes

25
00:01:47,29 --> 00:01:52,03
but in the face of what we've had about
to it. It's become extremely fragile.

26
00:01:52,04 --> 00:01:56,25
And so i think was a combination of
these two the beauty and the fragility.

27
00:01:56,27 --> 00:01:59,70
And also the fact that there was
so little left. We could see.

28
00:02:00,22 --> 00:02:01,79
Quite obviously when we
came to the north coast

29
00:02:01,79 --> 00:02:07,02
that the resident vegetation was on the
back foot and retreating very rapidly.

30
00:02:07,14 --> 00:02:10,55
It still is by the way despite
and political decisions

31
00:02:10,55 --> 00:02:15,16
that make people think it's saved in
fact it's still very much endangered.

32
00:02:15,18 --> 00:02:15,53
And so

33
00:02:15,53 --> 00:02:19,26
when we came to this area to buy land we
particularly want to get a bit of intact

34
00:02:19,26 --> 00:02:19,69
forest.

35
00:02:19,86 --> 00:02:25,97
So we ended up buying a piece of land
immediately adjacent to a state forest which

36
00:02:26,92 --> 00:02:28,75
on the surface appeared to
look in pretty good shape

37
00:02:28,75 --> 00:02:33,83
but as we became more adept at.

38
00:02:33,84 --> 00:02:36,53
Interpreting the signs in
the rainforest we could see

39
00:02:36,53 --> 00:02:40,52
that there had been some previous damage
from logging although a fair bit of it was

40
00:02:40,52 --> 00:02:43,73
in quite good shape and so
we bonded very quickly to

41
00:02:43,73 --> 00:02:46,53
that piece of land not only
the land that we farmed

42
00:02:46,53 --> 00:02:50,39
but the land adjacent because it was very
beautiful at the end of the valley with

43
00:02:51,21 --> 00:02:54,57
cliffs and tall forest and
beautiful cloud effects.

44
00:02:55,58 --> 00:03:01,59
So we became very attached to this area
and felt we should. Fight in its defence.

45
00:03:01,63 --> 00:03:03,35
When we discovered that it was in fact.

46
00:03:05,10 --> 00:03:06,72
In danger in the immediate future and

47
00:03:06,72 --> 00:03:12,07
that was after a few months after we
arrived at the place in 74 we discovered

48
00:03:12,07 --> 00:03:15,23
that there were plans to log
the forest and logging at

49
00:03:15,23 --> 00:03:21,07
that stage meant clear feeling and burning
and replacing with eucalypt forest.

50
00:03:21,09 --> 00:03:25,24
Which 20 years later now has been discovered
to be not a very effective system

51
00:03:26,59 --> 00:03:29,65
because either various timber problems
but you could see at the time

52
00:03:29,65 --> 00:03:33,52
that it was wasn't a good thing to do
to clear fell a very complex ecosystem

53
00:03:33,52 --> 00:03:35,15
and replace it with a monoculture

54
00:03:36,30 --> 00:03:39,12
but the prevailing forestry ethic
at the time was to do this.

55
00:03:40,39 --> 00:03:42,90
So i made it reaction was terror and.

56
00:03:43,51 --> 00:03:47,11
And need to fight actually are
initial reaction was to run.

57
00:03:47,25 --> 00:03:50,37
I have to admit sell the land go.

58
00:03:50,39 --> 00:03:54,02
But by coincidence a number of people had
moved into this area at the same time

59
00:03:54,02 --> 00:03:57,03
and just by discussing with
other people within days.

60
00:03:57,41 --> 00:03:59,86
Our courage had come back and.

61
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,73
We've felt yes we would fight this

62
00:04:01,73 --> 00:04:06,65
and it sprang very quickly the spirit of
fighting this issue came together very

63
00:04:06,65 --> 00:04:10,90
quickly with quite a small bunch
of people that gave me hope.

64
00:04:11,08 --> 00:04:15,12
The fact that so many people could feel
encouraged and feel they might even win

65
00:04:15,94 --> 00:04:19,08
but i think at the time we had no idea
what sort of battle we were talking about

66
00:04:19,08 --> 00:04:20,29
what sort of money. What sort of.

67
00:04:20,68 --> 00:04:26,78
Toll in terms of relationships money general
lives was a really big thing to take

68
00:04:26,78 --> 00:04:28,52
on which.

69
00:04:28,54 --> 00:04:35,33
Maybe i wouldn't have done if i'd
known how bad it would be much.

70
00:04:35,35 --> 00:04:38,75
Yes yes i worried about that
title for a long time of the.

71
00:04:39,07 --> 00:04:40,88
The defense of my own
backyard is something

72
00:04:40,88 --> 00:04:46,20
that i've worried about for some time because
this is the main accusation thrown at

73
00:04:46,20 --> 00:04:48,47
greens. But now i realise

74
00:04:48,47 --> 00:04:52,40
that it's very defensible it's it's quite
okay to fight for your own backyard.

75
00:04:52,67 --> 00:04:56,76
In fact everyone should fight for their
own backyard and maybe if we all did

76
00:04:56,76 --> 00:04:56,93
that

77
00:04:56,93 --> 00:05:00,55
and didn't worry about the global issues
so much we could have a consciousness of

78
00:05:00,55 --> 00:05:05,46
global issues but if we really concentrated
our energies on our local issue.

79
00:05:05,47 --> 00:05:07,04
Something could be done.

80
00:05:07,95 --> 00:05:09,23
And so now i feel much more confident

81
00:05:10,24 --> 00:05:14,48
that we can really fight for a very small
issue it might even be one tree on the

82
00:05:14,48 --> 00:05:17,43
street or it might be in this
case before thousand hectares.

83
00:05:18,54 --> 00:05:20,99
But all these issues can be
fought with an enormous vehemence

84
00:05:20,99 --> 00:05:25,07
and spirit by the people that are most
intimately involved and they're the ones

85
00:05:25,07 --> 00:05:27,21
that go on for years you get the residents

86
00:05:27,21 --> 00:05:28,45
that have lived at a place for 50 years

87
00:05:28,45 --> 00:05:30,08
and they're still fighting
for the same piece.

88
00:05:30,21 --> 00:05:32,68
I feel the same about this piece of forest

89
00:05:32,68 --> 00:05:36,64
that i fought for it then another
it's under national park control.

90
00:05:36,90 --> 00:05:40,62
I still worry about it in a
very intimate relationship.

91
00:05:40,64 --> 00:05:45,56
And i still have arguments with national
parks about the way they manage the place.

92
00:05:45,58 --> 00:05:49,84
Because although we've changed bureaucracies
the still the same problem that.

93
00:05:50,18 --> 00:05:53,05
The same concept at the
park is there for human use

94
00:05:53,81 --> 00:05:59,57
and we haven't yet switched to this.
Major radical. Mind movement that.

95
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:03,67
These places have got a right to exist
for their own sakes they've been there a

96
00:06:03,67 --> 00:06:07,08
long time without us.
We're very late comer.

97
00:06:07,10 --> 00:06:10,75
And we don't have to think that we're
the most important thing on the planet.

98
00:06:10,77 --> 00:06:17,12
So i still fight for that and.

99
00:06:18,01 --> 00:06:24,41
Motivation. Yes it's certainly a
deeper philosophical association.

100
00:06:24,57 --> 00:06:27,64
The idea that these places have
a right to exist on their own

101
00:06:28,72 --> 00:06:31,92
and i think along with being embarrassed
about fighting for my own backyard.

102
00:06:31,93 --> 00:06:34,55
I was embarrassed to admit
that it might be a passionate

103
00:06:34,55 --> 00:06:37,03
or religious feeling for the land.

104
00:06:37,06 --> 00:06:39,60
But now again i'm much
more confident about that.

105
00:06:40,81 --> 00:06:42,30
And the accusation

106
00:06:42,30 --> 00:06:46,03
that the green movement is somehow religious
has been thrown about very flippantly.

107
00:06:46,41 --> 00:06:49,24
But i think we can claim
that and not show to throw

108
00:06:49,24 --> 00:06:53,90
that away because what else have we got
going for us with the demise of so many

109
00:06:53,90 --> 00:06:55,71
other religions.

110
00:06:55,73 --> 00:06:59,73
Something has to fill the place because
humans do have a need for spirituality

111
00:06:59,73 --> 00:07:03,54
and what can be more spiritual
than the whole planet.

112
00:07:03,56 --> 00:07:08,36
So i feel we have to grasp
that one and and fight for it.

113
00:07:08,41 --> 00:07:11,24
Something maybe like chris eight of
which is a bit of a common image

114
00:07:11,24 --> 00:07:17,39
but i feel quite strongly that we
have to think of ourselves as that.

115
00:07:17,41 --> 00:07:28,50
Can you.

116
00:07:28,52 --> 00:07:29,38
On this.

117
00:07:29,51 --> 00:07:34,98
Further on the spiritual side of things i
don't like to espouse obvious dogmas like

118
00:07:34,98 --> 00:07:39,28
that the gaia hypothesis even though
i feel that's completely plausible.

119
00:07:39,87 --> 00:07:42,46
I think it's much more
of a personal issue.

120
00:07:42,48 --> 00:07:45,40
But i just happen to have the same personal
philosophy along with a lot of other

121
00:07:45,40 --> 00:07:47,50
people. And i guess you can call it.

122
00:07:47,77 --> 00:07:50,19
Deep ecology that there
is a name for it now

123
00:07:50,19 --> 00:07:53,85
or there's the dark green
environmental ism a number of names

124
00:07:53,85 --> 00:07:58,24
and a lot of them are derogatory.
But i feel happy to espouse those

125
00:07:58,24 --> 00:08:01,85
and take them on on that on a very
deep. Level because i feel it.

126
00:08:01,91 --> 00:08:06,49
We're just beginning to learn
the depth of spirituality and.

127
00:08:06,51 --> 00:08:09,43
Emotional feeling that the
aborigines had for the land.

128
00:08:09,78 --> 00:08:11,77
And i only i've only lived here 20 years.

129
00:08:11,79 --> 00:08:15,35
I don't depend on it financially
it's not my god it's not my food.

130
00:08:15,42 --> 00:08:18,49
It's not any of those things but
it's still terribly important to me.

131
00:08:19,52 --> 00:08:22,67
So i've got only got a glimmering
of what it meant to those people.

132
00:08:22,69 --> 00:08:26,87
And i feel the more that people can
have some sort of feeling for the land.

133
00:08:27,06 --> 00:08:30,54
The more hope we have got of rescuing
the planet because it's this divorce of

134
00:08:30,54 --> 00:08:33,96
feeling. That has got us into big trouble.

135
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:37,41
Now and it's we've now got the
land in the relationship that.

136
00:08:38,89 --> 00:08:41,85
That slaves and masters have been in
where the master has all the rights

137
00:08:41,85 --> 00:08:42,30
and responsibilities

138
00:08:43,35 --> 00:08:47,19
and in fact you can only really
own the slave by destroying it.

139
00:08:47,25 --> 00:08:51,13
And that's what we've found in
australian relationships with land

140
00:08:51,13 --> 00:08:52,91
that unless you're doing something to it.

141
00:08:53,00 --> 00:08:54,87
Clearing it or plowing it
you don't really own it.

142
00:08:55,85 --> 00:08:58,87
So we have to turn our attitudes
to the land on on their heads

143
00:08:59,70 --> 00:09:03,91
and include the land in our morality which
is very difficult for most australians

144
00:09:03,91 --> 00:09:07,21
to feel because they've always
had the frontier attitude

145
00:09:07,21 --> 00:09:14,14
that it's a battle to
conquer it. You know. Yes.

146
00:09:15,42 --> 00:09:20,25
It's very sad that that alienation
exists because in the end it will be.

147
00:09:20,27 --> 00:09:21,77
Found doom ridden doesn't it.

148
00:09:21,79 --> 00:09:26,52
But it will be the death of us if we can't
start including the land in the way we

149
00:09:26,52 --> 00:09:29,39
feel in the way we love
what hope of we've got

150
00:09:29,39 --> 00:09:33,66
and this increasingly becomes a problem
with the dominance of of economics as the

151
00:09:33,66 --> 00:09:34,41
main mode of thinking

152
00:09:34,41 --> 00:09:39,20
that everything absolutely everything
can be translated into dollar terms

153
00:09:39,20 --> 00:09:42,94
and i saw a couple of days ago
ross kelly talking about.

154
00:09:43,75 --> 00:09:46,38
That the control of pollution and the.

155
00:09:46,40 --> 00:09:49,95
The reversal of the degradation in
rivers has to be tied into economics

156
00:09:49,95 --> 00:09:51,71
and i just groaned thinking that.

157
00:09:52,61 --> 00:09:54,30
People need to do it for the river sake

158
00:09:54,30 --> 00:09:57,76
and for the land's sake not
because it's going to pay them

159
00:09:57,76 --> 00:10:02,11
or not pay them to do the
right or wrong thing. Yes.

160
00:10:03,50 --> 00:10:07,99
No.

161
00:10:09,31 --> 00:10:10,84
That's right.

162
00:10:12,37 --> 00:10:14,74
Yes it's very disturbing
especially when you realize

163
00:10:14,74 --> 00:10:20,47
that a lot of the activities that are
actually degrading contribute to the g

164
00:10:20,47 --> 00:10:22,02
and p or the economy as a whole.

165
00:10:23,03 --> 00:10:25,58
These two things are non-compatible so
we maybe have to start thinking about

166
00:10:25,58 --> 00:10:30,22
abandoning our economic system which is
very difficult because the belief in

167
00:10:30,22 --> 00:10:34,77
perpetual growth is so profound that
you virtually can't even bring it up.

168
00:10:34,84 --> 00:10:38,14
It's like saying mother's milk
poisonous or something like that

169
00:10:38,14 --> 00:10:41,42
that just doesn't follow.

170
00:10:41,44 --> 00:10:44,72
But we need something as radical as that
and that's why i think the people that.

171
00:10:45,28 --> 00:10:47,57
Started working in nimbin 20 years ago.

172
00:10:48,25 --> 00:10:52,91
Can still contribute a lot because they
have that basically very radical idea that.

173
00:10:53,20 --> 00:10:56,73
The system has to go. Even
though you and i are.

174
00:10:57,13 --> 00:11:00,57
I can say are entrenched in the system
to some extent we've published books

175
00:11:00,57 --> 00:11:04,06
and we've printed them on paper that
came from trees that were filled

176
00:11:04,06 --> 00:11:06,49
and we live in a wooden house
and we use the postal system

177
00:11:06,49 --> 00:11:11,31
and all these other things i still feel
if i can let that go if i need to.

178
00:11:12,36 --> 00:11:14,29
We just can use that as a
vehicle to change minds

179
00:11:14,29 --> 00:11:16,20
but we don't have to be attached to it.

180
00:11:16,29 --> 00:11:20,97
We have to be attached to consumerism as
not only a way of life but as an ethic

181
00:11:20,97 --> 00:11:24,51
and as a duty to keep the economy
going. It's an absurd proposition.

182
00:11:25,25 --> 00:11:26,68
We have to learn how to let go

183
00:11:27,68 --> 00:11:31,72
and i think that's what niman has with
all its problems and all its horrors.

184
00:11:31,74 --> 00:11:37,15
Has really taught a lot of people that you
can let go and live a lot more simply.

185
00:11:37,17 --> 00:11:40,43
And i know the thing i feel very
strongly about this possibly not.

186
00:11:40,57 --> 00:11:44,53
Not a sequitur from what we've been
talking about but i feel strongly

187
00:11:44,53 --> 00:11:48,01
that with all the problems
in nimbin in this area.

188
00:11:48,03 --> 00:11:49,27
We didn't have to prove

189
00:11:49,27 --> 00:11:52,75
that we could actually solve the
whole planet's problems in one go.

190
00:11:54,07 --> 00:11:57,80
It seems unfair to me to
focus on the alcoholics

191
00:11:57,81 --> 00:11:59,18
and the drug addicts in the streets.

192
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,75
Look at mainstream society you can't say
it's squeaky clean it has no problems.

193
00:12:04,12 --> 00:12:07,33
So it's ok to have problems we just
have to be proud of the things that

194
00:12:07,33 --> 00:12:12,03
that have occurred and a lot of that is
the putting a crack into the main system.

195
00:12:12,30 --> 00:12:14,90
The assumption that consumerism
is the only way to go.

196
00:12:15,46 --> 00:12:19,35
I think there's a lot to be proud
of in the last 20 years since.

197
00:12:20,04 --> 00:12:22,45
Nimbin and rainier creek
and all the other issues

198
00:12:23,42 --> 00:12:27,12
but there's an awful
long way to go as well.

199
00:12:28,64 --> 00:12:35,45
You know.

200
00:12:37,10 --> 00:12:41,88
I think. From 1974 which is
when you and i first discovered

201
00:12:41,88 --> 00:12:43,32
that the force was to be locked.

202
00:12:43,40 --> 00:12:49,03
There was a campaign until 1979 of just the
conventional methods of fighting issues

203
00:12:49,03 --> 00:12:54,86
that was endless letters to ministers
endless submissions appeal for clemency

204
00:12:55,80 --> 00:12:56,94
invitations to visit the area

205
00:12:56,94 --> 00:13:02,71
and so on all of which chinked away
at the edifice of forestry expertise

206
00:13:02,71 --> 00:13:05,23
but we didn't actually get to
a point where we could win.

207
00:13:05,67 --> 00:13:08,67
Even though they'd compromise
to a certain extent.

208
00:13:08,68 --> 00:13:12,01
But we felt in view of what was
happening to the forest in this area.

209
00:13:12,19 --> 00:13:14,85
This wasn't really a compromise.

210
00:13:14,87 --> 00:13:18,03
So we kept fighting and it wasn't
until almost the last minute

211
00:13:18,03 --> 00:13:21,08
when the blockade started
to occur in september 1979

212
00:13:21,08 --> 00:13:25,67
that the group the main group called to
rainier native forest action group actually

213
00:13:25,67 --> 00:13:30,26
contemplated a blockade. We do
ways felt we must win before then.

214
00:13:30,29 --> 00:13:32,32
Because the argument
seemed to be so apparent.

215
00:13:32,99 --> 00:13:36,89
How could they not listen to what we're
saying the naivete staggers me now we just

216
00:13:36,89 --> 00:13:37,10
thought

217
00:13:37,10 --> 00:13:40,34
that they would have to accede to our
demands because they were so obvious

218
00:13:40,34 --> 00:13:43,24
and so we didn't actually have
a blockade planned at all.

219
00:13:43,38 --> 00:13:48,32
We joked about it in very lighthearted
terms that no one had organised anything.

220
00:13:48,34 --> 00:13:51,47
And so when the crunch came and the
bulldozers were definitely coming.

221
00:13:52,54 --> 00:13:54,65
We put out a call at the
local market which was.

222
00:13:55,86 --> 00:13:59,93
Called the china market just a local
market of kraft people put it.

223
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,96
Call did a couple of minor bits vegetating
and bangor we had. Oh i don't know what.

224
00:14:05,96 --> 00:14:07,25
How many people there
were at the first day

225
00:14:07,25 --> 00:14:11,97
but about 100 came almost immediately
which really floored it because we had no

226
00:14:11,97 --> 00:14:14,81
idea that they should taken such
a hold on people's imagination.

227
00:14:15,82 --> 00:14:17,09
Unfortunately for the people

228
00:14:17,09 --> 00:14:21,44
and the only nato force action group who
had been working on the political side

229
00:14:21,44 --> 00:14:24,83
but neglected the social side the
people who came were very good at

230
00:14:24,83 --> 00:14:27,28
that stuff a lot of them
came from communities

231
00:14:28,27 --> 00:14:31,98
and began to work out a social
system extremely effectively

232
00:14:31,98 --> 00:14:36,65
and also a physical system for for life
support for cooking washing water.

233
00:14:37,02 --> 00:14:39,71
Childminding health everything else.

234
00:14:40,39 --> 00:14:43,69
Just staggered me how quickly
they could get that together.

235
00:14:43,71 --> 00:14:47,75
And so we all tended to feed off each
other we need to be able to support each

236
00:14:47,75 --> 00:14:49,31
other because there were a lot of problems

237
00:14:49,31 --> 00:14:52,72
that always in a bunch of people like
that there are a lot of personal problems

238
00:14:52,72 --> 00:14:53,40
and conflicts

239
00:14:53,40 --> 00:14:57,61
and difficulties in solving them especially
if you work on the consensus system

240
00:14:57,61 --> 00:15:00,60
and don't have a hierarchy.
So there were problems

241
00:15:00,60 --> 00:15:04,29
but it was an extremely exciting
time when we all felt very strongly

242
00:15:04,29 --> 00:15:06,54
that we were doing
something very important

243
00:15:06,54 --> 00:15:15,42
and historic.

244
00:15:15,43 --> 00:15:19,41
The blockade went on for. I think two or
three weeks it's hard to remember now.

245
00:15:19,53 --> 00:15:23,82
So long ago. I feel i should have these
figures in my memory but it was about

246
00:15:23,82 --> 00:15:29,62
that long. And not from from the very
beginning there were some police involved

247
00:15:29,62 --> 00:15:33,55
but these numbers escalated very quickly
when rand attempted to tough it out.

248
00:15:34,98 --> 00:15:41,88
And we got up to. Dozens of police at some
stage and how many 20 20. Paddy wagons.

249
00:15:41,96 --> 00:15:45,79
We had to have some photographs which
were quite graphic of the number of blue

250
00:15:45,79 --> 00:15:46,86
shirts that there were there

251
00:15:46,86 --> 00:15:51,49
and as always with all these demonstrations
you had some extremely heavy police

252
00:15:51,49 --> 00:15:52,86
that were very intimidating

253
00:15:52,86 --> 00:15:55,22
and i mean on the other scale
some who are very supportive

254
00:15:56,30 --> 00:15:59,91
and just said i'm doing my job
but i agree with you sow.

255
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,36
There was quite a concerted campaign to
tackle the police themselves on a personal

256
00:16:04,36 --> 00:16:09,25
level not on aggressive level. And i in
particular had an experience when i.

257
00:16:09,73 --> 00:16:13,52
For once was up in the forest on my own
just getting a bit of an up because i was

258
00:16:13,52 --> 00:16:18,03
so exhausted and came across one of
the upper echelon cops who was lost.

259
00:16:19,33 --> 00:16:21,25
And i thought i had my
chance to lose this bastard

260
00:16:21,25 --> 00:16:23,50
and make it really
embarrassing for him but

261
00:16:23,50 --> 00:16:26,51
that i thought no i
have to to do good p.r.

262
00:16:26,51 --> 00:16:29,56
So i in fact chatted with him
and took them even i split

263
00:16:30,45 --> 00:16:33,14
and led him out of the forest
and i think he was grateful

264
00:16:33,14 --> 00:16:34,53
but he realised he was very vulnerable.

265
00:16:34,77 --> 00:16:36,78
He didn't know the bush
come from somewhere else

266
00:16:36,78 --> 00:16:41,83
and he felt afraid of the place was i
felt as if i was in my living room.

267
00:16:42,05 --> 00:16:43,38
I felt so at home in

268
00:16:43,38 --> 00:16:49,58
that piece of forest.

269
00:16:49,60 --> 00:16:53,33
You know just talking to them
treating them like people

270
00:16:53,33 --> 00:16:59,73
and listening which i've learnt subsequently
is absolutely vital not to even try

271
00:16:59,73 --> 00:17:03,50
and put your ideas across just ask
questions and ask how it is for them.

272
00:17:04,48 --> 00:17:07,11
And sometimes you get an
enormous rush of feeling from

273
00:17:07,11 --> 00:17:09,40
that person because they may never
have been listened to before.

274
00:17:10,80 --> 00:17:12,17
And i particularly knows this

275
00:17:12,17 --> 00:17:17,76
that nobody which was later demonstration
for another piece of forest nearby.

276
00:17:17,78 --> 00:17:18,61
When a group of demonstrators

277
00:17:18,61 --> 00:17:22,72
and i entered the prohibited area of forest
where there were some loggers guarding

278
00:17:22,72 --> 00:17:25,30
some equipment. Not that we
were threatening it anyway

279
00:17:26,37 --> 00:17:30,92
and some people attacked them verbally not
abusing but yelling arguments at them

280
00:17:30,92 --> 00:17:33,03
and you could see the
reaction was a brick wall.

281
00:17:34,43 --> 00:17:35,17
But i perceive

282
00:17:35,17 --> 00:17:38,51
that if i just listen to one of the chaps
in particular the one with the doberman

283
00:17:38,51 --> 00:17:42,96
and the one who is really likely to let
fly with a fist first talking to him he

284
00:17:42,96 --> 00:17:45,16
would come down and it was true.
It was worked like magic.

285
00:17:45,49 --> 00:17:46,62
Just listening to his grievances.

286
00:17:48,24 --> 00:17:51,57
And finding out what was going on for them
was very important because they have got

287
00:17:51,57 --> 00:17:54,58
extremely important grievances
that no one was listening to

288
00:17:55,38 --> 00:17:56,67
and i still feel strongly that the.

289
00:17:57,10 --> 00:17:59,56
People at the bottom of the
ranks in forestry and.

290
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,80
In the the logging camp are the ones
that get victimized all along the line.

291
00:18:03,83 --> 00:18:05,17
They're the ones that get thrown out

292
00:18:05,17 --> 00:18:09,84
when you get meal rationalizations one
meal taking over another the blokes get

293
00:18:09,84 --> 00:18:11,69
dumped. It's the bottom
blokes that get dumped.

294
00:18:11,80 --> 00:18:12,09
Every time

295
00:18:12,09 --> 00:18:15,14
when you get a big new machine it's
the less skilled ones are get dumped.

296
00:18:15,23 --> 00:18:15,57
Every time

297
00:18:16,55 --> 00:18:19,66
and now they felt they were being victimised
by the greens as well so they were

298
00:18:19,66 --> 00:18:22,02
just in an absolutely no win situation.

299
00:18:22,15 --> 00:18:24,55
So i think we're few started
listening to someone

300
00:18:24,55 --> 00:18:28,13
and listen to what they were worried
about they had plenty to say

301
00:18:28,13 --> 00:18:33,13
and we needed to hear that stuff we couldn't
just forced our own ideas onto them.

302
00:18:34,43 --> 00:18:40,01
Because comparatively the greenside
was more. Had more internal support.

303
00:18:41,35 --> 00:18:43,66
We had formulated ideas
to a certain extent

304
00:18:43,66 --> 00:18:48,04
and had it quite a good network of
people who knew who felt the same way

305
00:18:48,75 --> 00:18:52,99
but these logging blokes felt isolated
you could see a very isolated

306
00:18:52,99 --> 00:18:56,05
and very threatened and of course you
threatened if you love a good looks like.

307
00:18:56,12 --> 00:18:57,33
Getting shot from under you

308
00:18:58,15 --> 00:19:00,72
and they're not only threatened for most
are threatened by the mill ownership as

309
00:19:00,72 --> 00:19:05,25
well as we've seen subsequently there's
huge employment losses with these mills

310
00:19:05,25 --> 00:19:07,46
either closing down and
taking other mills over

311
00:19:08,54 --> 00:19:12,01
or putting in new machines to dice these
books so they were very threatened

312
00:19:12,01 --> 00:19:14,80
and i think we could have done
more on that score more listening

313
00:19:14,80 --> 00:19:22,32
and more actually physically
helping these people.

314
00:19:22,34 --> 00:19:31,25
But it's going to get people.

315
00:19:34,22 --> 00:19:35,54
I think the throne you creek

316
00:19:35,54 --> 00:19:38,54
and they might not be issues
were very formative in bringing.

317
00:19:39,10 --> 00:19:41,49
Many of the greens together
and a lot of green thought

318
00:19:42,23 --> 00:19:45,90
but i don't think we can take the credit
for a lot of the green movement in the

319
00:19:45,90 --> 00:19:49,34
area. I think that was something that
was coming. Anyway. Was quite clear.

320
00:19:49,66 --> 00:19:52,72
But at the time the
green movement did feel

321
00:19:52,72 --> 00:19:57,80
that the support from sydney wasn't forthcoming
and there's a certainly the urban.

322
00:19:59,03 --> 00:20:04,13
Tide that is there. Certain tired
green movement that compared with us.

323
00:20:04,20 --> 00:20:05,17
Was very straight

324
00:20:05,17 --> 00:20:09,37
and we certainly looked like the dirty
hippie people in the hills which wasn't true

325
00:20:09,37 --> 00:20:13,13
but it was just the image that came
across at the time and so we needed

326
00:20:13,13 --> 00:20:19,49
that the city suited people to to
help us help the media realize

327
00:20:19,49 --> 00:20:24,53
that in fact this was a very widespread
movement. Unfortunately when.

328
00:20:24,55 --> 00:20:27,89
Of course the people up here were talking
to the media always the cameras go to the

329
00:20:27,89 --> 00:20:30,58
most way out looking crazies.

330
00:20:30,60 --> 00:20:33,74
But the bulk of the movement
wasn't there wasn't these people.

331
00:20:33,77 --> 00:20:35,58
It was very straight live more people

332
00:20:36,37 --> 00:20:41,58
and people in this area in the valley some
selves who may not have dressed in suits

333
00:20:41,58 --> 00:20:45,77
and ties but had a very well thought
out philosophy and. A lot of.

334
00:20:46,42 --> 00:20:48,60
A lot of thinking going into the
way that they were operating

335
00:20:48,60 --> 00:20:54,45
and also a lot of professional and
other expertise plenty of people with.

336
00:20:54,98 --> 00:20:59,40
I think advertising in advertising
training or photographic training

337
00:20:59,40 --> 00:21:01,24
or teaching training or.

338
00:21:01,81 --> 00:21:06,68
Media training all sorts of different skills
that we could apply to this situation.

339
00:21:07,77 --> 00:21:13,21
Area. Reputation breeding. Extreme.

340
00:21:14,29 --> 00:21:17,58
Yes that's something to be
proud of. I think we need.

341
00:21:18,49 --> 00:21:22,62
This area has had a reputation for
breeding green extremists which i think is

342
00:21:22,62 --> 00:21:24,19
something we can be extremely proud of.

343
00:21:24,29 --> 00:21:25,75
In fact there's now a t-shirt

344
00:21:25,75 --> 00:21:29,46
that you can buy put up by the local
environment centre same green extremist.

345
00:21:30,98 --> 00:21:32,76
So that's a good thing
but i'm a bit worried

346
00:21:32,76 --> 00:21:36,91
that the green extremist idea may
get hijacked by commercialism

347
00:21:38,30 --> 00:21:39,85
and be sold as a nice idea

348
00:21:39,85 --> 00:21:42,86
but we really don't have to do
anything very constructive about this

349
00:21:42,86 --> 00:21:44,21
and i think that's something

350
00:21:44,21 --> 00:21:48,00
that the whole movement in this area
has to really worry about that.

351
00:21:48,07 --> 00:21:49,97
Our opposition.

352
00:21:49,99 --> 00:21:54,54
The world of economics and
commercialism and large bureaucracies

353
00:21:54,54 --> 00:21:59,15
that are intent on doing the same as they've
always done these people have now got

354
00:21:59,15 --> 00:22:03,39
the skills. Who use green
ideas against us and so

355
00:22:03,39 --> 00:22:09,11
that the normal person in the street thinks
they're doing something useful by using

356
00:22:09,12 --> 00:22:11,70
unbleached toilet paper
and feel good about it

357
00:22:11,70 --> 00:22:14,46
but are basically still a
major part of the problem.

358
00:22:15,22 --> 00:22:19,35
So i think that's the next challenge for
us we appear to have had a major win

359
00:22:19,35 --> 00:22:22,70
that looks like people really
care about this these issues.

360
00:22:23,22 --> 00:22:26,32
But underneath it all has
been a very minor change

361
00:22:26,32 --> 00:22:30,03
and that's what we have to work on now.

362
00:22:31,87 --> 00:22:35,55
You know a changed.

363
00:22:36,52 --> 00:22:45,20
Story.

364
00:22:45,22 --> 00:22:55,08
You know.

365
00:22:55,09 --> 00:22:59,24
There's certainly been a very strong
anti green movement come into being.

366
00:22:59,53 --> 00:23:01,09
Since the especially

367
00:23:01,09 --> 00:23:06,13
that quick battle where for a start we
were ahead because we had all innovative

368
00:23:06,13 --> 00:23:10,89
ideas such as using advertising which
hadn't been thought of a green issue before

369
00:23:11,72 --> 00:23:15,84
so we are ahead on that score. But now
there's a problem with the backlash to

370
00:23:15,84 --> 00:23:16,00
that

371
00:23:16,00 --> 00:23:22,23
and an increasing sophistication of tactics
from large bureaucracy such as advertising

372
00:23:22,92 --> 00:23:25,22
and getting across what i
considered to be false information.

373
00:23:26,37 --> 00:23:30,42
But i'm not too concerned about the backlash
against green movements in the general

374
00:23:30,42 --> 00:23:32,56
population. I think that
is actually diminishing

375
00:23:33,29 --> 00:23:37,83
and green ideas are increasing because of
the evidence is so apparent we don't have

376
00:23:37,83 --> 00:23:42,81
to pretend that it's not happening. So i
think the violent anti-green movements.

377
00:23:43,81 --> 00:23:44,81
Will go in time

378
00:23:45,88 --> 00:23:50,08
but what we have to deal with in the
immediate future is is the apathy

379
00:23:50,08 --> 00:23:50,91
and the belief

380
00:23:50,91 --> 00:23:56,27
that it's all okay so i think you get
people like the more extreme members of the

381
00:23:56,28 --> 00:23:59,90
forestry protection for. Society
association should know that.

382
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,87
Times such as rage was that.
Rational action against green.

383
00:24:06,89 --> 00:24:08,95
Extremists.

384
00:24:08,96 --> 00:24:11,96
That meant rational action i
think against green extremists

385
00:24:12,95 --> 00:24:14,46
and i can see where these people.

386
00:24:14,48 --> 00:24:18,93
Come from they come from a position
of fear and powerless knus

387
00:24:18,93 --> 00:24:21,03
and it's easy to attribute causes

388
00:24:21,03 --> 00:24:25,64
and agreement green green
to the most obvious cause.

389
00:24:25,66 --> 00:24:26,96
So they will continue to be a problem

390
00:24:26,96 --> 00:24:32,88
but they will diminish what we have to
guard against is increasing apathy.

391
00:24:32,90 --> 00:24:37,44
So it's quite obvious with the greenhouse
effect having a big impact on public

392
00:24:37,44 --> 00:24:39,96
consciousness for the first year
or two it was talked about and.

393
00:24:40,64 --> 00:24:46,12
It's not discussed too openly. Changed.

394
00:24:46,14 --> 00:24:48,20
Of options

395
00:24:48,21 --> 00:24:55,42
and i don't know.

396
00:24:55,43 --> 00:25:01,20
You know. Now.

397
00:25:02,63 --> 00:25:08,25
Offering to provide. You.

398
00:25:09,28 --> 00:25:12,48
Yes the green movement certainly has to
start offering some positive alternatives.

399
00:25:12,65 --> 00:25:15,82
We have been saying no
for a very long time

400
00:25:15,82 --> 00:25:20,64
and unfortunately getting the image
of course that we're very negative

401
00:25:20,64 --> 00:25:24,00
and against everything. But
i think that's reasonable.

402
00:25:24,29 --> 00:25:27,68
Not to have these solutions when you're
pointing to a problem. It's like.

403
00:25:28,22 --> 00:25:32,00
A doctor saying you've got cancer
and they mightn't have the answers

404
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:33,56
but they still have to point
out that you've got a problem.

405
00:25:33,79 --> 00:25:35,96
So i think it's reasonable
for us to do that.

406
00:25:36,87 --> 00:25:42,00
But of course to increase public credibility
we do have to provide more in the way

407
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:43,18
of positive answers. Not

408
00:25:43,18 --> 00:25:47,20
that we haven't been doing this for some
time talking about reforestation being

409
00:25:47,20 --> 00:25:52,01
number one priority in this area with
the huge percentage of the great land

410
00:25:52,01 --> 00:25:56,62
that we have this is obviously a big question
which could solve a lot of employment

411
00:25:56,62 --> 00:25:59,48
problems of a degradation problem
solve a lot of planetary problems.

412
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,16
So we haven't been neglecting this issue
but we have to do it more effectively.

413
00:26:04,08 --> 00:26:07,72
And i think. As far as i'm concerned
the economics is a major problem.

414
00:26:07,77 --> 00:26:13,19
And so green people have to show more
explicitly how to live very softly on the

415
00:26:13,19 --> 00:26:15,97
earth and this means scaling down our.

416
00:26:16,45 --> 00:26:18,83
Economic involvement out
our desire to have things

417
00:26:18,83 --> 00:26:22,44
and becoming done with these socially
mobile as some of the people on hbo.

418
00:26:22,46 --> 00:26:24,54
Do you suggest that it's
a very good idea that.

419
00:26:24,75 --> 00:26:30,07
We have to stop aspiring to own more things
which obviously have a terminal impact

420
00:26:30,07 --> 00:26:34,08
on the planet. So we have to sabotage
the economic system from within

421
00:26:35,30 --> 00:26:38,73
and this will have enormous ramifications
for the forestry industry apart from

422
00:26:38,73 --> 00:26:39,10
anything else.

423
00:26:40,77 --> 00:26:44,58
We're not saying don't use trees we're
saying use an awful lot less than we are at

424
00:26:44,58 --> 00:26:46,12
the moment and that goes for
everything else as well.

425
00:26:46,38 --> 00:26:52,10
So i think if greens can show themselves
to be capable of living lightly on the

426
00:26:52,10 --> 00:26:54,96
planet. And coming up with
some alternative suggestions.

427
00:26:55,11 --> 00:26:59,05
They're going to look a lot more be looked
on a lot more favorably by the general

428
00:26:59,05 --> 00:27:02,43
populace at the moment we have
a few people that consider

429
00:27:02,43 --> 00:27:05,47
that having a rosewood table is
like if you plan to rosewood.

430
00:27:05,83 --> 00:27:10,39
But as far as i'm concerned. One seedling
doesn't equal 1000 year old tree.

431
00:27:11,18 --> 00:27:14,93
We have to do a lot more than that we
have to start using pine for instance.

432
00:27:15,47 --> 00:27:18,21
Which here and i have done in this house.

433
00:27:18,22 --> 00:27:21,46
Because those plans are in the
ground now we should use them

434
00:27:21,46 --> 00:27:22,73
and not keep using the old for

435
00:27:22,73 --> 00:27:27,30
that no matter how great it sound to plant
a tree is just really not going to work.

436
00:27:27,70 --> 00:27:30,87
We have to back off for some
period now and that these forests

437
00:27:30,87 --> 00:27:35,90
and indeed the whole country recover from
our ravages it's a difficult one because

438
00:27:35,90 --> 00:27:37,72
you can see the economic
impact will be enormous.

439
00:27:38,20 --> 00:27:40,82
That's why we have to escape
from this strait jacket.

440
00:27:42,04 --> 00:27:44,43
Of economic consciousness that
we have at the moment that

441
00:27:44,43 --> 00:27:48,28
that money is what will count money will
get us out of our problems increased

442
00:27:48,28 --> 00:27:51,11
growth increased use of resources
will get us out of these problems

443
00:27:51,11 --> 00:27:57,05
and a child can see that
this is a nonsense.

444
00:27:57,07 --> 00:27:58,30
Good questions.

445
00:28:03,77 --> 00:28:05,24
Yes.

446
00:28:06,29 --> 00:28:09,78
Working out how to stay green and
be completely non-hypocritical

447
00:28:09,78 --> 00:28:12,66
and completely pure is extremely difficult

448
00:28:12,66 --> 00:28:14,57
and i've decided it's
completely impossible

449
00:28:15,61 --> 00:28:19,44
and for a long time i've been
vulnerable to the accusation of.

450
00:28:19,85 --> 00:28:24,65
Well you drive a car you wear
shoes you walk on wouldn't flaws

451
00:28:25,82 --> 00:28:28,64
and i still worry about that
one and i still want to be.

452
00:28:28,66 --> 00:28:31,05
As pure as possible while realizing

453
00:28:31,05 --> 00:28:35,43
that if i was obsessed with consuming things
i'd be not only contributing to the g

454
00:28:35,43 --> 00:28:39,81
and p but i'd be untroubled by
feelings of hypocrisy i would in

455
00:28:39,81 --> 00:28:41,97
that sense be a good person.

456
00:28:42,05 --> 00:28:47,10
Whereas now i feel that if i cut a treat
and i my property to make a fence post.

457
00:28:47,11 --> 00:28:49,30
I'm somehow involved in
oh you know hypocrisy.

458
00:28:49,51 --> 00:28:53,73
But i'm coming to terms with that
and i think all i can do is my best

459
00:28:54,58 --> 00:28:57,00
and most people in fact
do that all the time

460
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:00,27
but we greens have to be
even more aware of that

461
00:29:01,40 --> 00:29:05,11
and not let ourselves slip into
into bad ways but i'm aware

462
00:29:05,11 --> 00:29:09,27
that you know nursery for instance we produce
hundreds of thousands of trees every

463
00:29:09,27 --> 00:29:11,09
year which sounds like a great idea

464
00:29:11,09 --> 00:29:15,06
but we use plastic pots we use
recycled ones where we can

465
00:29:15,06 --> 00:29:18,87
but we still use some new ones. So
we're very open to accusations of.

466
00:29:20,53 --> 00:29:23,95
Bad practices because i haven't
personally investigated the factory

467
00:29:23,95 --> 00:29:25,14
that makes these plastic pots

468
00:29:25,14 --> 00:29:28,78
and no doubt it's dumping its effluent
into the local creek. Who knows.

469
00:29:29,06 --> 00:29:31,39
And we use sand that's
dredged from the river

470
00:29:32,66 --> 00:29:35,76
and no doubt the sand there because
the the up slopes have been cleared

471
00:29:35,76 --> 00:29:39,58
and so i'm still responsible for everything
that goes on and i'm really aware

472
00:29:39,58 --> 00:29:43,69
that i personally have got a stake in
the whole degradation of the planet.

473
00:29:43,72 --> 00:29:46,98
So although this can give you
an enormous load of guilt.

474
00:29:48,15 --> 00:29:52,73
You have to somehow put it on the one
shoulder not have it on both shoulders.

475
00:29:53,05 --> 00:29:57,89
So use your guild as a motivator motivating
force to keep you as clean as you

476
00:29:57,89 --> 00:29:59,81
possibly can but don't be over when.

477
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:01,00
Good by and

478
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:05,27
that is the trick for almost all the greens
i now know operating the veterans of

479
00:30:05,27 --> 00:30:09,26
these old campaigns of how
to manage their guilt burden

480
00:30:09,26 --> 00:30:10,66
and their hypocrisy burden

481
00:30:10,66 --> 00:30:16,10
and still be effective positive happy people
who know they've got an issue to work

482
00:30:16,10 --> 00:30:19,47
on and don't want to be
crippled by the feelings

483
00:30:19,47 --> 00:30:21,21
that maybe something wrong
with what they're doing.

484
00:30:22,43 --> 00:30:24,60
For instance i use a car
and i'm very aware of that

485
00:30:24,60 --> 00:30:30,22
that i would step a lot more lightly on
the planet if i walk and serve driving.

486
00:30:30,24 --> 00:30:33,17
But the problems at the moment are
so crucial that you have to shortcut

487
00:30:33,17 --> 00:30:37,66
and fact use the paraphernalia
of the opposition to fight it.

488
00:30:37,79 --> 00:30:40,90
So that's why i use a
computer which no doubt.

489
00:30:40,92 --> 00:30:47,30
Had 50's involved it's manufactured
the list of hypocrisy with endless.

490
00:30:47,32 --> 00:30:53,49
I just try to get them
under control. Thank you.

491
00:30:54,37 --> 00:31:00,69
Very at the very same time.
Looking back now after 20 years.

492
00:31:00,71 --> 00:31:03,13
From an experiment on.

493
00:31:03,15 --> 00:31:05,45
I've come to the
conclusion that the ethics

494
00:31:05,45 --> 00:31:09,56
and ideas of the original even
people were and are still correct

495
00:31:10,50 --> 00:31:15,30
but often they're swatted by just
the prevailing lack of energy and.

496
00:31:15,32 --> 00:31:19,30
Hopelessness even a of a lot of people
unfortunately the people who are doing all

497
00:31:19,30 --> 00:31:20,56
the destroying of the planet.

498
00:31:21,38 --> 00:31:22,27
The ones i've got all the energy

499
00:31:22,27 --> 00:31:25,93
and initiative are the ones i've got
precisely the wrong ideas about stimulating

500
00:31:25,93 --> 00:31:28,73
the economy and consuming more and. And.
