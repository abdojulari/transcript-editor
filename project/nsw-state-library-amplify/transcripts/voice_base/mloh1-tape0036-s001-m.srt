1
00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:09,04
Identification this is the interview redress.

2
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:10,39
With a with the stand,

3
00:00:10,39 --> 00:00:32,13
London boilermaker in Newcastle on the twenty fourth of February nineteen eighty two he was very along the are only two

4
00:00:32,13 --> 00:01:01,11
years later, Wembley at the thirty women will make you when I speak of it as a direct by seven you were anyway, veggie,

5
00:01:01,11 --> 00:01:14,76
it's a long while she was no longer of the Earth twelve months after I feed the premiership of official who is the

6
00:01:14,76 --> 00:01:29,34
youngest boilermaker read by about eighteen months one of fellow came in the working mate of mine your previously going

7
00:01:29,34 --> 00:01:32,41
to the bar.

8
00:01:32,41 --> 00:01:40,74
I made several that sounds a bit of living in a matter of time to get a job that Mister Hippel,

9
00:01:40,74 --> 00:01:49,58
he was outside the manager of the film on your down to occasion

10
00:01:49,68 --> 00:02:00,01
but eventually said well that you are the assist those that will give you the no of the

11
00:02:00,01 --> 00:02:09,03
or fever here young man alive heading on the other, realising that both of them are a really good

12
00:02:09,57 --> 00:02:19,67
and I started over twenty who started straight away on the artist, it is that they were about

13
00:02:20,82 --> 00:02:31,28
and the view started as a riveting where your plate at the assembly so you are building up in actual fact for the

14
00:02:31,28 --> 00:02:47,77
relative the very secular regular place they move a particular many expected and the need section,

15
00:02:47,77 --> 00:02:57,86
plus together some of the life they were about eighty ability to imagine.

16
00:02:58,01 --> 00:03:10,4
The early staggering up the other order in Jamaica varied according to think of the section are all the lateral racing

17
00:03:10,4 --> 00:03:25,76
well they got down to the other very rarely read that you are in those days sermon.

18
00:03:25,76 --> 00:03:32,55
It was all riveting wasn't that map can you explain the process as you remember it over the assembly of the of the

19
00:03:32,55 --> 00:03:36,31
arched her the rigours job and your job afterwards, however,

20
00:03:36,31 --> 00:03:53,15
have a yet all actually the job was assembled in the shop may shop and the first stand a fully assembled in the shop

21
00:03:53,31 --> 00:03:56,58
and before that came out the next spammers may

22
00:03:56,69 --> 00:04:06,69
and fitted to the first the so as to make sure that the be no different when

23
00:04:06,69 --> 00:04:17,11
when the last so long with respect to the shop will not hold rare agreement out to make sure that everything perfect

24
00:04:17,11 --> 00:04:21,34
that you have no trouble with the

25
00:04:21,34 --> 00:04:34,97
and naturally they have been turned up driving fit into the whole police prisons make sure that free go to the bulk

26
00:04:35,48 --> 00:04:38,96
within that in the effort whatever.

27
00:04:38,96 --> 00:04:48,67
but In many cases the slight distortion was the plague put a bowl and every time you could be placed together,

28
00:04:48,67 --> 00:04:57,00
but sometimes be sixty four the sixteenth of them so for the level of the river came along he have to come along the

29
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:11,2
river, then an as you know it expands vinegar beyond critical point rivet amazingly well in reverse

30
00:05:11,2 --> 00:05:12,65
when you put them in the river,

31
00:05:12,65 --> 00:05:23,12
not the River about contracts will contraction naturally placed together well in a utterly are seen.

32
00:05:23,12 --> 00:05:34,82
Possibly dozens of rivers within them. We have cut them out so that the place of Fuller together, then the river.

33
00:05:34,82 --> 00:05:40,01
We go through the inspectors would come along test each ribbon individually

34
00:05:40,15 --> 00:05:49,12
and possibly level hundreds in one US dollar, so there is a lot of work done as you learned

35
00:05:49,12 --> 00:05:57,35
and happily Lilly government wasted away because they were that particular about making joints,

36
00:05:57,35 --> 00:06:09,97
extra time F will only a very well at question here is so in the first place you'd have to put in pens as well is as

37
00:06:09,97 --> 00:06:13,73
bold, what do I want proportion was pens involves well.

38
00:06:13,73 --> 00:06:19,65
Her regular whether they will love these pins, according to the number of plates

39
00:06:20,08 --> 00:06:26,13
and pillion have that sometimes be legible, not another Gay survey my vanity.

40
00:06:26,13 --> 00:06:34,8
Six of them long member just a slight taper either in of state was in the quarter steel pin were okay.

41
00:06:34,8 --> 00:06:45,22
Well the regular human supplement, as we prepayment healthily signal a selection are they dislike them

42
00:06:45,22 --> 00:06:47,16
and get them in the rigours

43
00:06:47,32 --> 00:06:59,05
and then he can for the boilermaker Venables his job to come up with the bulk were people of the world well then been

44
00:06:59,05 --> 00:07:02,68
spectrum come along, as they will joints of the plate is not close enough.

45
00:07:02,68 --> 00:07:05,85
He had affiliated insert in the whole

46
00:07:06,2 --> 00:07:17,76
and have a little foot well if he could insert which possibly measure of sale of each,

47
00:07:17,76 --> 00:07:24,48
I can't say you're the one that have to be put in a minimally mother with the place at the Vegemite,

48
00:07:24,48 --> 00:07:31,76
beautiful thing that the big birthday before they were allowed to river. The job of if you've got your site.

49
00:07:31,76 --> 00:07:35,42
Hence, as I stated earlier, the root of the river theme

50
00:07:35,42 --> 00:07:42,57
and contractor must take place in sprawling replaced together which you couldn't do by bolting daily with

51
00:07:42,57 --> 00:07:45,97
but above that every element of the case.

52
00:07:45,97 --> 00:08:00,4
If they collided practically every joint at the but are definitely a job whereby every joint to be so five.

53
00:08:00,4 --> 00:08:08,85
The lymph node- version of DragonDictate length later on in the sea here

54
00:08:08,85 --> 00:08:15,73
or less of a particular about both your big plaything tight

55
00:08:16,7 --> 00:08:23,78
and it was Boilermakers job to type permanent repaint your job the ones that were bolting up first before the rivers to

56
00:08:23,78 --> 00:08:32,74
get into fight we could get the river would come along expect would check the first equated with them along right with

57
00:08:32,74 --> 00:08:36,27
the reports in them as a writer

58
00:08:36,27 --> 00:08:46,87
and that we cut them out now are sometimes the River about the Lib Dems have you it behind someone

59
00:08:46,87 --> 00:08:57,72
or wipe with another in the boilermaker cross cut through the centre in there was never any Oxley by the way of the

60
00:08:57,72 --> 00:09:08,98
cutting down on your some reason it was always done by putting a crosscut back the record of that which is thereby

61
00:09:09,03 --> 00:09:17,89
river up in the battered the rounded and giving evidence eighty thousand litres of bacteria.

62
00:09:17,89 --> 00:09:22,42
The back is one half of the nine plus eight in other words,

63
00:09:22,42 --> 00:09:31,45
was bowled well back up a fairly good measure of the one after that it plus one eight.

64
00:09:31,45 --> 00:09:39,65
The diameter of the bat will you put across that and then when you write down the plate when you

65
00:09:39,86 --> 00:09:42,41
and several of them are made.

66
00:09:42,84 --> 00:09:52,22
That we did with the head of the month was surely affect well that you have punched that river,

67
00:09:52,22 --> 00:09:55,37
there believe me though, heart,

68
00:09:55,37 --> 00:10:04,87
both of them without much weight on the section the Giffnock who holds to have time to they have to be drilled at their

69
00:10:04,87 --> 00:10:14,75
own way of getting them out punch failed yes, I understand to me when you are home together,

70
00:10:14,75 --> 00:10:22,65
doing everything afterwards or we will have whole time I was a seminal essence is a different sort of job,

71
00:10:22,65 --> 00:10:24,03
although the river discovered,

72
00:10:24,03 --> 00:10:33,09
finally responsible for that though for the joint is no know actually the boilermakers responsible for the quality of

73
00:10:33,09 --> 00:10:41,06
its lengthy finish building up the sake he is back to say okay

74
00:10:42,48 --> 00:10:48,14
and that it what you have found the length of five will get labour.

75
00:10:48,14 --> 00:10:58,71
It would stand member that of a long outside because of the work went on inside the pool really bothered with in the

76
00:10:58,96 --> 00:11:09,43
examiner way down. You can often than that in the terrific pressure dealers as they avoid all the plates together.

77
00:11:09,43 --> 00:11:11,2
Therefore, the river.

78
00:11:11,2 --> 00:11:11,89
The job

79
00:11:11,89 --> 00:11:26,01
and then up the side that figure one million comeback to mencap one out because we live willing to fifty seventy get-together

80
00:11:27,19 --> 00:11:38,52
tool might be a price of market make sure you do that without no way otherwise of the flower go about your within the

81
00:11:38,52 --> 00:11:53,07
snap will have a map because of lust are well with that through the other room will need to decide that rip them if

82
00:11:53,07 --> 00:12:04,7
they have so people are sitting became lead to eleven in the day that they have become out you the five sure that the

83
00:12:04,7 --> 00:12:12,11
valley, well if of the thumb gave the still a very heavy wind is a pleasure to have put treasures.

84
00:12:12,11 --> 00:12:23,39
It is very leisurely evidence that they above record every top choice, and as and when outside of the plates,

85
00:12:23,39 --> 00:12:25,55
then the tenth of life.

86
00:12:25,55 --> 00:12:45,7
They have the bed with reducing down the line acre want down the base of the about half some could have been a little

87
00:12:45,7 --> 00:12:54,81
bigger than those of the start of the gradual vision, a half people are beginning

88
00:12:54,82 --> 00:13:11,12
and they gradually be reduced out of the wood of the given that the incidentally VM, the amount of thumb,

89
00:13:11,12 --> 00:13:17,78
the accuracy that was required arm was required was it not because of everything is straight in at that they had to get

90
00:13:17,78 --> 00:13:22,06
the egg. The angles exact type is exact in order to meet in the centre.

91
00:13:22,06 --> 00:13:32,24
I have well either side of the bridge were up there that I will take applicable in both their them there was a slap of

92
00:13:32,24 --> 00:13:36,03
concretely high with the surveyor at least.

93
00:13:36,03 --> 00:13:37,67
I stand

94
00:13:37,75 --> 00:13:52,48
and that the wonderful in my mind that are among because they were that all particular because the bridge that of the

95
00:13:52,48 --> 00:14:02,9
start of the little without the line in the Simon got to the centre might be at about the selection of staff from about

96
00:14:02,9 --> 00:14:18,24
the bottom of the lovely so here is the lead with your monthly limit is there about three steel ropes are the rows

97
00:14:18,24 --> 00:14:28,12
and rows of these able take a backup taken into the sure rock on she will as well.

98
00:14:28,12 --> 00:14:35,16
I think they achieve level was the only bridge of the way I have been

99
00:14:35,16 --> 00:14:48,97
and gone among the seventy dollars a year than Barlow began more were to be sophisticated because eleven I realise were

100
00:14:48,97 --> 00:14:58,86
pleased them family has researched the Wellington mail information that they could anchor the steel raved about the

101
00:14:58,86 --> 00:15:06,34
support of the way of the actual amount, plus the creeper crane which weighed approximately five hundred and four.

102
00:15:06,34 --> 00:15:09,52
That was creeping up after each,

103
00:15:09,52 --> 00:15:23,29
then went up creep up like a bicycle chain will be heavily with only very slowly on the bridge that vibrate a little

104
00:15:23,29 --> 00:15:36,41
humour well over the working of the outsider that considered the feeling of cluster B really feeling this movement take

105
00:15:36,41 --> 00:15:42,65
place the new. The claimant going up the news that the first of Monday the greater the risk.

106
00:15:42,65 --> 00:15:55,08
Please will be out of the rough laws in their home in my mind at the way of the fitting of a blow around during our

107
00:15:55,08 --> 00:15:55,88
move around

108
00:15:55,88 --> 00:16:06,74
when the weather was while yet to make the it was even though they does love the did not earn homogeneous picture drawn

109
00:16:06,74 --> 00:16:18,83
with the three. One five an hour. Just big your sharp game though that, and so the now lives on a very hot day.

110
00:16:18,83 --> 00:16:28,61
I have them twelve measures will so that none of these rivets on the value issue workload in the that of the work that

111
00:16:28,61 --> 00:16:37,28
a centralised that being rated almost together, but was locked.

112
00:16:37,28 --> 00:16:43,99
This year the rivers eventually and therefore the latter part of his life.

113
00:16:43,99 --> 00:16:56,71
Even the hang of, and from the record one good support the rabbi level thereon so that have well the sheer

114
00:16:56,92 --> 00:17:02,05
and the methane is hanged out see that people

115
00:17:02,05 --> 00:17:15,63
and workplace factors that down the hang of them at the effect island with the King of May.

116
00:17:15,63 --> 00:17:16,87
I

117
00:17:17,17 --> 00:17:30,85
when I look back the amount of the delivery lies in the what one of linear theirs that the number of because they make my

118
00:17:31,9 --> 00:17:40,42
impact them have a feeling they are actually hear the test

119
00:17:41,05 --> 00:17:54,2
but with the way that they have elected them in the amount of the full away from the ground that the average of the

120
00:17:54,2 --> 00:18:01,59
like have no I believe they weren't that they were built like that the children colours propped up from a made the

121
00:18:01,59 --> 00:18:17,86
great one that both of the five will be the below her the several bridges were built like that a lot more in Zimbabwe.

122
00:18:17,86 --> 00:18:27,46
In addition to these several bridges were built like that in Zimbabwe in Rhodesia by father but not the same.

123
00:18:27,46 --> 00:18:41,12
That know any of a size that the big has the fifth of them have been completely for the limbo with excellent

124
00:18:42,37 --> 00:18:44,84
but will come later.

125
00:18:44,84 --> 00:18:53,69
I have one thing in the me the way that gay and lonely

126
00:18:54,03 --> 00:19:03,96
when have the slow down the plaintiff you don't forget that in the lead in Sydney. Those rows of map on the Capel.

127
00:19:03,96 --> 00:19:14,23
The case went back to me about the men have a meet the low weight these heavy threes diameter steel rope that

128
00:19:14,23 --> 00:19:17,95
expenditure which is never in hundred feet stretch.

129
00:19:17,95 --> 00:19:30,42
I should say that that was the so that at the very least one row below the upgrade below have faith that do the work

130
00:19:30,55 --> 00:19:36,55
list of the top row on following that so therefore venture that take place.

131
00:19:36,55 --> 00:19:47,76
The grapes were guaranteed to stretch twelve inches every hundred of our is a fact because I check them by asking one

132
00:19:47,76 --> 00:19:58,93
of the engineers was amazing to think a rate they region diameter stretch made in the great weight stresses placed on

133
00:19:58,93 --> 00:20:03,27
the the growth in the US.

134
00:20:03,27 --> 00:20:11,87
They will have to spread because the bringing down the wood of the round the favour of the people alone to meet the

135
00:20:11,87 --> 00:20:12,7
other.

136
00:20:12,7 --> 00:20:22,71
They came up November come the mode of being out to make college with that you might be must deal with five hundred

137
00:20:22,71 --> 00:20:35,56
pounds on the side of the liver level of therefore at the end of what has become about a third of men

138
00:20:35,56 --> 00:20:46,4
and just the ladder down because of the ten inches square

139
00:20:46,4 --> 00:20:51,87
and was hoping to the other one in the seventy at home in the pilot

140
00:20:51,87 --> 00:20:59,81
and around the second what the defect images where will it was the pilot

141
00:20:59,81 --> 00:21:06,54
and the term that was in the middle square pin was sure they jacked out ahead of the of the art show them to make sure

142
00:21:06,54 --> 00:21:09,57
they would line up,

143
00:21:09,57 --> 00:21:21,61
they are big round of levellers around pen with a one-to-one across the crossed out that a unified will then as I said

144
00:21:21,61 --> 00:21:33,81
earlier at the square billing nervous weapons went out like like a finger-pointing are just had to get it in line

145
00:21:33,81 --> 00:21:39,36
without a socket square socket square pin jacked them out ahead,

146
00:21:39,36 --> 00:21:46,24
just to make sure they were absolutely aligned Holden that was apart from the the domain pens which came across the

147
00:21:46,37 --> 00:21:59,08
accords that is to join in the three in charge in the first place in the letter they were only used it

148
00:21:59,08 --> 00:22:09,2
when writing the middle to the square hole in one of the two there were no with a near the bottom,

149
00:22:09,2 --> 00:22:22,53
there was only to one in the lower lower court of each one of that I wasn't your narrowminded that you are they where I

150
00:22:22,53 --> 00:22:35,78
have pictures night will give that they are nevertheless the check them out to make a last bacon run transversely

151
00:22:35,78 --> 00:22:49,89
crossover your life it with your getting a bar could have been things like memory pictures of the earlier posting me

152
00:22:49,89 --> 00:22:55,78
the original calculation Troy I will use the value of the middle

153
00:22:55,78 --> 00:23:03,92
and the such things I were to ask you about the conditions that the working conditions as those what was it like inside

154
00:23:03,92 --> 00:23:12,12
the courtroom are welded gives that was developed because you knew that was going to be hard work

155
00:23:12,12 --> 00:23:26,68
and the white space really that the earth will receive your man back within the industrial trouble we had a a few were:

156
00:23:27,78 --> 00:23:39,15
a lunchtime meeting them will never after an output of the common move that that examine meeting are we never had any

157
00:23:39,15 --> 00:23:49,85

00:35:40,45 --> 00:35:44,45
the bingo to go the river.

221
00:35:44,45 --> 00:36:00,01
They were badly that although I do like at all of the hospital at the boilermaker of the December were better than the

These are living in June by the on the took of strongly held the level of the pro- EU management.

225
00:36:18,91 --> 00:36:26,62
They never further than you ever support groups over who will let Anglo vascular coming on being a month, sixty,

00:36:26,62 --> 00:36:34,88
sixty one inch angle on all the thickness of placement coming in them that would have to have someone because you

230
00:36:56,68 --> 00:37:04,16
The cooker, but it should would go with a four twenty three thousand where they are local religions are present.

231
00:37:04,16 --> 00:37:15,92
Well the apartment at this obstacle held with Natalie the product is easier to not down a lot will run contract to take

place at the regular

233
00:37:21,14 --> 00:37:40,66
but I will see what a thing that goes up to a value early about using a together with the way they tell me

00:37:40,66 --> 00:37:45,69
when they were riveting on the courts are upside down.

235
00:37:45,69 --> 00:37:54,81
They used to go really is to go inside the court then another hold-up outside a one hundred quickly the system will

236
00:37:54,81 --> 00:38:07,16
make the labour it have a Mayor Dolly 's he was all it is only used safely in the roof space down the bottom corner of

00:38:07,16 --> 00:38:08,09
the pipe.

238
00:38:08,09 --> 00:38:24,54
The point of the steel spoken to both the but the revision of the dial out just in the air on the user that a court,

239
00:38:24,54 --> 00:38:27,76
the legal and exert a key

240
00:38:27,76 --> 00:38:39,04
and did not doubt whether the blackout available without about the yes I have a level of the point I'm making is this

241
00:38:39,04 --> 00:38:45,9
that therefore the the cover plate that was right down the centre of the upper and lower courts,

242
00:38:45,9 --> 00:38:47,3
the displaced them together.

243
00:38:47,3 --> 00:38:48,46
Yes you,

00:38:48,46 --> 00:38:56,6
but must bend riveted upside down for the reporters on the bottom OIC of your get you where it was possible the river

00:39:22,42 --> 00:39:29,98
is holding me the rivet gun against his need and will revert the average had a grid.

248
00:39:29,98 --> 00:39:41,36
The rigour which is heavily on whatever they thought one as well some big member of the government had to wait so

249
00:39:41,36 --> 00:39:50,00
they'll won't work properly. They get older they go it them the year.

250
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:58,17
Labour would have his dolly working of something above this edit possible if not inevitable lunch after the heavy

251
00:39:58,17 --> 00:40:11,24

00:40:11,24 --> 00:40:22,9
the Riverside, one of the enough about them to be found himself that most cases they used an adult return

253
00:40:22,9 --> 00:40:24,37
and answer the two

254
00:40:25,54 --> 00:40:35,47
and a lack of plunger inside of the band of well that if I another was being knocked from evenly only the head was

00:40:36,05 --> 00:40:47,71
existing for the book on the boilermaker using graph of make the head on the sale of the family in

256
00:40:47,71 --> 00:40:56,49
when they you have carefully some cases,

257
00:40:56,49 --> 00:41:11,52
just because you have mentioned will bottles of her room well available that do not doubt trivia debating what you

258
00:41:11,52 --> 00:41:26,2
think of her. when You are doing over to be developed in the way they will cease to make silo in my case mail.

259
00:41:27,31 --> 00:41:38,61
I didn't move will not dispute among them below the line of learning to drive the mat is always on the side of the

260
00:41:38,61 --> 00:41:39,88
river by the way.

261
00:41:39,88 --> 00:41:40,47
In other words,

262
00:41:40,47 --> 00:41:50,38
the river takes the world of because it might derivative them with above litter over Buckley back gives over the bulk

263
00:41:50,38 --> 00:41:59,56
that in them that well naturally through the fact that they voted the receipt that they can take that out them in the

264
00:41:59,56 --> 00:42:02,94
last the number who without letting go back,

265
00:42:02,94 --> 00:42:14,64
before the make sure that you could rally snap around in there to make tighter case that last following getting

266
00:42:15,93 --> 00:42:25,49
contractions safe place on every rivet will you get a one hour knockabout okay and if they did not doubt he,

267
00:42:25,49 --> 00:42:28,71
taking eleven go back and one previous month.

268
00:42:28,71 --> 00:42:41,28
Few that might willingly got back all the way along the seven zones like hard work. I worked out.

269
00:42:41,28 --> 00:42:42,5
Nevertheless, two hundred

270
00:42:42,5 --> 00:42:49,57
and eight lines of rivets across the harbour on the courts alone just above all the places in the lead all the joints

271
00:42:49,57 --> 00:42:50,56
and such like two hundred

272
00:42:50,56 --> 00:43:00,45
and eight Lions are rivets in the cord to learn from one side of the harbour to the other two hundred may driven two

273
00:43:00,45 --> 00:43:06,29
hundred and eight lines of rivets from one side of arbiter. The other across the cords alone.

274
00:43:06,29 --> 00:43:16,44
That's right across the harbour lengthwise on all public commitment because they sleep demonstrated.

275
00:43:16,44 --> 00:43:23,03
You may longitudinally go across that way, run across the effluent give me a call.

276
00:43:23,03 --> 00:43:27,45
There are two hundred and eight lines of rivets across the harbour,

277
00:43:27,45 --> 00:43:30,59
but has worked it out to give some people some idea only rivers.

278
00:43:30,59 --> 00:43:44,39
There are holding in the business of five to six million. In SOA was five million.

279
00:43:44,39 --> 00:43:44,79
In summary,

280
00:43:44,79 --> 00:43:55,35
lovers of six million mixed up with the lecture urges on the grave in the room that yes it with either five

281
00:43:55,35 --> 00:44:01,81
or six million nine it suffered people say five million but to limit furnace.

282
00:44:01,81 --> 00:44:11,3
The directorate on long nova hundred one hundred and one thousand cut out according to the Public Works,

283
00:44:11,3 --> 00:44:24,33
you never like your average life that at the beginning of an early commitment to find out the date they will have made

284
00:44:24,33 --> 00:44:27,25
the know them Avenue Hamley meant limits their work.

285
00:44:27,25 --> 00:44:30,41
They were weighed only seminar how many tonnes they were evident,

286
00:44:30,41 --> 00:44:37,92
however it now little different sizes senility actually know they calculated the first estimate was just over five

287
00:44:37,92 --> 00:44:38,45
million

288
00:44:38,48 --> 00:44:47,95
and the last estimate was round about six million of the set six million net bulge in the family go vegan of the havoc

289
00:44:47,95 --> 00:45:08,78
that will they live in it outside of the two hundred one LaMonica well the Wakeman firm who weighed the missing they

290
00:45:08,78 --> 00:45:14,1
weighed three thousand two hundred tonnes of rivers that they don't know what sizes were

291
00:45:14,1 --> 00:45:17,66
or all of them 's analogy is actually calculated how many rivers.

292
00:45:17,66 --> 00:45:27,4
There were at the very worst from five million six and it in the way of section of the court whether yes,

293
00:45:27,4 --> 00:45:33,27
but I have it with me that altogether was about fifty eight thousand fifty two thousand tonnes,

294
00:45:33,27 --> 00:45:40,16
it will you would have a core

295
00:45:40,46 --> 00:45:48,31
but the BH is a half arches before their match with just under twenty thousand tonnes of death,

296
00:45:48,31 --> 00:46:01,27
but nineteen thousand something each side of the harbour on a hundred and twenty five movement

297
00:46:01,27 --> 00:46:04,59
but I was a eleven hundred and twenty eight cables on each side.

298
00:46:04,59 --> 00:46:09,12
There was a hundred twenty eight, and each of them was supposed to carry one hundred and eight tonnes,

299
00:46:09,12 --> 00:46:13,27
but at times wet as you said that stretch more than one.

300
00:46:13,27 --> 00:46:17,65
Sometimes they carried up to about a hundred and twenty tonnes, but they were tested to three hundred

301
00:46:17,65 --> 00:46:28,6
and sixty two there are about the one listed on a special machine in Middlesbrough

302
00:46:28,6 --> 00:46:38,39
and even though a specially built for the job or at least limited to the three hundred and sixty to
