1
00:00:23,95 --> 00:00:35,33
Identification. This is Station fourteen recorded on Tuesday the sixteenth of September.

2
00:00:36,88 --> 00:00:46,09
And of course the interview with faith and. And Karen and Craig and will begin in a few seconds and identification.

3
00:00:47,19 --> 00:01:01,63
We were in at the end of last. Yes well. I did I finished off what I wanted to do in.

4
00:01:02,42 --> 00:01:12,36
My father's village and those who were related to me and I came home. I was having coffee one day.

5
00:01:12,38 --> 00:01:23,15
A young friend who worked on the bill picked. And I was just happened to be telling him that.

6
00:01:23,16 --> 00:01:29,8
I'd finished the book and come home and finish the book and I had a copy of it and I showed it to him.

7
00:01:29,99 --> 00:01:37,77
I was just excited the wonderful colors on Monk. And he said to me.

8
00:01:38,85 --> 00:01:44,39
You know you said I'll talk to Bill about this you know we might be able to fit it into the series.

9
00:01:45,08 --> 00:01:59,56
Well the result of was that was going back to Amber I'm. My father's village a television unit and to my father's.

10
00:02:01,2 --> 00:02:17,24
We had a boy and of course the gay B.C. Arranged it so that we were and we were welcomed. Who was a Catholic.

11
00:02:18,87 --> 00:02:32,59
There were seven Catholics and he absolutely insisted that we stay with him. And he lived in a quite.

12
00:02:32,61 --> 00:02:39,31
In a place called Craig. The in the north. And.

13
00:02:39,95 --> 00:02:51,66
You know I think the House must have been built by the first person when they're probably a planter. It had a very.

14
00:02:51,68 --> 00:03:04,84
It had a lot. And we were treated the red carpet was out for us father who was just wonderful.

15
00:03:05,05 --> 00:03:11,81
And he had a army of women who worked for nothing.

16
00:03:12,81 --> 00:03:22,78
But that's how it was everywhere they have I'm not saying it was wrong but that was. At night we'd have.

17
00:03:23,13 --> 00:03:27,45
We'd work all day from early in the morning.

18
00:03:27,76 --> 00:03:32,26
Until about sunset and then we'd go back to the house

19
00:03:33,25 --> 00:03:41,61
and there'd be a better half a dozen women there cooking the evening. And it was cooked as a French cook.

20
00:03:41,93 --> 00:03:50,44
Because you see fathers it was French and we had chicken cooked beautifully.

21
00:03:52,5 --> 00:03:57,72
The priest would go into his cellar and bring up the best of what.

22
00:03:57,73 --> 00:04:03,91
And when the drink the ones that he would back down and bring up the French look at yours

23
00:04:04,85 --> 00:04:13,97
and he'd say these are what the ladies of Paris. And this was true and I kept him supplied.

24
00:04:13,99 --> 00:04:22,93
And I can always remember sitting out on the front for and there with Bill. And. I mean. We just sit.

25
00:04:22,99 --> 00:04:35,12
He's smoking his cigar and me thinking about my dad. And all his family. And experience.

26
00:04:35,24 --> 00:04:44,33
Yes it was a finish the job and they dropped the bill and myself and my brother wall off

27
00:04:44,34 --> 00:05:00,21
but they aren't of Mahler cola. And they you know when to take some shots of the. Volcano. And very angry. You know.

28
00:05:00,69 --> 00:05:08,09
And I went up and took some shots over the top of it and of course we were left on the island of mana color

29
00:05:08,09 --> 00:05:15,37
and we said well how could you get it right anyhow my lookalike contacted villa

30
00:05:15,37 --> 00:05:36,97
and they were simply a small plane over for us and the pilot said that he had to stay for a short time.

31
00:05:38,13 --> 00:05:42,34
So we landed there and he had to pick up some something like that

32
00:05:43,47 --> 00:05:48,65
and he was my brother was talking flight a happy camper me.

33
00:05:48,67 --> 00:05:59,17
With the people of who understood that I didn't know that he could you see how does wonderful and to Terry my wife.

34
00:05:59,19 --> 00:06:09,06
So finally we went back to the luxury of the first class hotel library. And I could scrape the dirt off.

35
00:06:09,08 --> 00:06:26,7
Anyhow we did return and. The documentary wish shown on the A.B.C. In the series pictures Australia. Well.

36
00:06:26,72 --> 00:06:39,03
I was going to say that I did talk about water Leni previously the person who became the prime minister of our two I

37
00:06:39,03 --> 00:06:41,01
had a very high regard for water.

38
00:06:41,57 --> 00:06:47,37
And he campaigned he was the leader of the campaign for independence over there

39
00:06:48,16 --> 00:06:52,28
and the English guy even without any problem at all.

40
00:06:52,75 --> 00:06:59,32
I think that had a lot to do with the fact that water happened to be an Anglican priest

41
00:06:59,32 --> 00:07:04,63
and he had good communicating skills particularly with the English and with the church

42
00:07:06,9 --> 00:07:10,42
but the French really dug their heels in. I didn't want to.

43
00:07:14,2 --> 00:07:22,99
And I'm sure that if watered had a very good after independence to. Formed. A strong cabinet.

44
00:07:24,46 --> 00:07:28,07
He would have done much more for the country than in fact he did

45
00:07:28,07 --> 00:07:38,25
but the problem was then finding people with the skills and the know how. And it wasn't an easy task. Far from it.

46
00:07:38,29 --> 00:07:46,33
It's a matter of fact and so course countries go around and the bloody hill now. Just got rid of water and.

47
00:07:46,89 --> 00:08:03,68
Crooks came into it. Sad and terrible story. But that was found in my village. Well. I came home and. What.

48
00:08:03,7 --> 00:08:15,84
Incidentally while we were sitting on that beautiful over and. The producer. I knew very very well said.

49
00:08:18,87 --> 00:08:26,71
I knew he was going with a friend who intend to marry. And he said to me.

50
00:08:27,53 --> 00:08:34,5
Well five we have decided to get married and we'd like you to marry us and want to have a license.

51
00:08:34,51 --> 00:08:42,51
I can't marry you now. Lionel Murphy who had introduced the idea. You know.

52
00:08:42,99 --> 00:08:51,67
Marriage celebrants and there were only about two or three marriage celebrant separate times there was Julia Morrow.

53
00:08:51,95 --> 00:09:01,06
And Jill Fuller. And maybe one or two others. Now of course. But so he said to me.

54
00:09:01,1 --> 00:09:10,71
Well I said I can't I haven't got a license. He said oh who fixed it and so when we got back to rank. And said to her.

55
00:09:10,86 --> 00:09:22,13
You ring up Kep Enderby who was. The federal attorney and ask him if I can perform I'm married.

56
00:09:22,61 --> 00:09:28,87
I don't know what happens. But the approval came through for me to perform the marriage.

57
00:09:30,34 --> 00:09:37,94
I did the result of that without wanting to ever be a marriage celebrant I became a marriage celebrant.

58
00:09:37,95 --> 00:09:46,19
Well that life as a marriage celebrant in the fifty's. And almost into the ninety's.

59
00:09:46,2 --> 00:09:54,16
Was not without considerable interest. I refused to charge people last.

60
00:09:54,72 --> 00:09:59,46
I thought you can make people pay to get married nor should you.

61
00:10:00,04 --> 00:10:06,01
And I doubt some to cover my expenses if I had a fair way to travel or something like that.

62
00:10:06,34 --> 00:10:17,74
You know I have always been for the belief that one should never have to pay to be buried. You know to be married.

63
00:10:19,63 --> 00:10:29,81
Well. I was present and I go off and do a marriage and I come home and tell hands about it.

64
00:10:31,06 --> 00:10:38,53
Why don't you write a book and call it WILL YOU MARRY ME. And I thought about this very seriously.

65
00:10:39,06 --> 00:10:42,11
Remember I thought I'd end up in court.

66
00:10:43,25 --> 00:10:50,87
Like for instance young couple said they liked me to perform the marriage so I said well you have to come and see me

67
00:10:50,87 --> 00:10:55,34
and tell me what you'd likely to see him so focus on and I said.

68
00:10:55,49 --> 00:11:03,88
Actually you can write it all yourself if you want to quite prepared to read it. But anyhow they came.

69
00:11:03,89 --> 00:11:19,61
And asked to be married and I said well you will just be. And I said. Not having a breakfast.

70
00:11:20,68 --> 00:11:35,72
Do you want me to perform. And park park which is right up on the Hill. Before you get into. Our city.

71
00:11:37,8 --> 00:11:46,6
I said I'll just be asked to have couple of witnesses and couple of witnesses. So I would have to the pack.

72
00:11:48,00 --> 00:11:57,9
And in the power in the group. And they witnesses and there was another couple there also who were sitting on a binge.

73
00:11:58,49 --> 00:12:03,83
Just sort of looking out to the sea.

74
00:12:04,7 --> 00:12:11,9
And when I called them together to perform the married couple came up and stood behind.

75
00:12:14,32 --> 00:12:23,07
You know they looked like Pynchon. Really. Extremely poor.

76
00:12:23,92 --> 00:12:32,6
And I thought the people in June in the park and they see something unusual. To just see what was going on.

77
00:12:33,76 --> 00:12:41,47
Well after for saying goodbye to the couple. I said you had a couple of you know I'm looking.

78
00:12:43,32 --> 00:12:53,54
And the woman and I were my parents. And then I stopped stopped and I said look it's been this way.

79
00:12:54,87 --> 00:13:00,48
And the man who is Chinese. The parents a very American their daughter.

80
00:13:00,99 --> 00:13:14,01
And that have opposed very very strongly very strongly. And she said I had to marry an Australian.

81
00:13:14,03 --> 00:13:22,64
And he incidentally he was one of the owners of one of the restaurants damage Chinatown I might mention.

82
00:13:22,66 --> 00:13:29,28
So you know there was. And then the Japanese woman and Australian man.

83
00:13:29,78 --> 00:13:35,26
Who came and asked me to perform their marriage and I said years of course

84
00:13:35,26 --> 00:13:41,79
when would you like to get married I said we'd like to get married on New Year's Day and she told me that her sister

85
00:13:43,09 --> 00:13:53,63
and brother in law were flying in that morning. For arriving at six o'clock on a plane from Tokyo to be the witnesses.

86
00:13:53,65 --> 00:14:03,01
I said you do you want to get married. Well out on the lookout amount of well every year.

87
00:14:03,3 --> 00:14:13,39
Alan Ashbolt would have his party. And you know something like fifty of us. That he said to us that the previous week.

88
00:14:13,96 --> 00:14:20,97
Not having a party this time you know so on. I thought that sort. We can get together another time.

89
00:14:22,99 --> 00:14:24,85
But everybody went just the same.

90
00:14:27,43 --> 00:14:33,47
And they could leave here first before they'd go around the corner to Alan's Fleiss so it got that way.

91
00:14:35,72 --> 00:14:45,92
And we didn't get home till four in the morning and I had to be up there at six o'clock. I couldn't keep my eyes open.

92
00:14:46,22 --> 00:14:48,45
I couldn't truly.

93
00:14:49,39 --> 00:14:52,77
So I got out of there and had already resigned

94
00:14:52,77 --> 00:14:59,69
but it still full of the background to the little marriage which just lovely. It was beautiful.

95
00:15:00,09 --> 00:15:05,87
So then they say you must come and have breakfast I said I really should.

96
00:15:07,19 --> 00:15:10,03
Oh you must come and have breakfast for the first break first.

97
00:15:10,36 --> 00:15:17,9
We'll be at the bride's place in a second breakfast at the groom's place so we go up here to a unit with a proud list

98
00:15:17,9 --> 00:15:26,29
and if we had you know. A teaspoon of fish and teaspoon or save.

99
00:15:26,93 --> 00:15:32,4
And a teaspoon of something else and that was breakfast and it and a thimble of wine.

100
00:15:32,92 --> 00:15:37,71
So then the next the broad group says Well now we're going to have my breakfast

101
00:15:38,59 --> 00:15:45,79
and we went to his mother's place which wasn't awfully far away it was but he can and.

102
00:15:45,81 --> 00:15:53,52
Toast and a big part of the well for years and.

103
00:15:53,54 --> 00:16:04,86
They kept in touch with me and every Christmas the crowd would come from. It was a lovely absolutely lovely. Well.

104
00:16:06,11 --> 00:16:18,48
You know that in itself is truly a book. You know the married. Of very very wealthy people. In the glory.

105
00:16:18,87 --> 00:16:20,98
Backyard flick.

106
00:16:22,31 --> 00:16:30,13
And you'd have one group and one in the garden and another group at the gathering not talking to each other

107
00:16:30,13 --> 00:16:37,19
and what's going on right now. Or she hasn't left a will to this. Well no sense.

108
00:16:37,19 --> 00:16:42,34
I didn't leave anything to that's what it was like when someone dies

109
00:16:42,34 --> 00:16:48,33
and leaves the will lose all of the terrible up evil more often than not it's like this was married.

110
00:16:49,03 --> 00:16:57,23
And here they were drinking while I'm not talking. And I thought Isn't it strange. It's a foreign culture to me.

111
00:16:59,39 --> 00:17:05,1
And you did this for thirty years didn't show no I did it for for about ten years.

112
00:17:05,66 --> 00:17:10,37
Yes it's about ten years since I stopped doing it but I only ever did three

113
00:17:10,37 --> 00:17:18,9
or four in here I couldn't face it you know the squabbles between the relations and ring me up on that I'd say.

114
00:17:18,92 --> 00:17:21,33
Look thrice.

115
00:17:22,19 --> 00:17:29,65
I'm sorry that you have to perform this marriage of my son to that terrible woman she's a dreadful woman

116
00:17:29,65 --> 00:17:36,45
or to be vice versa. Happens. She's marrying that man and that would be the room off.

117
00:17:37,06 --> 00:17:43,98
And I would be the meat in the controversial. Yes.

118
00:17:43,99 --> 00:17:53,7
Oh the WHO very very few that you could say were really happy with their problems family problems and.

119
00:17:54,93 --> 00:18:01,3
You know they drink from Tasmania or Perth and. Get on a plane and come and marry us.

120
00:18:02,61 --> 00:18:07,11
You know all expenses paid no worry.

121
00:18:10,52 --> 00:18:18,73
And well the numbers of celebrants increased and it became quite commercialized and then I stopped.

122
00:18:18,87 --> 00:18:24,98
I didn't tell anyone I was too ashamed to say that I was a celebrant became.

123
00:18:25,18 --> 00:18:35,23
Because it became a manny making it and the fee was thirty five dollars per federal government

124
00:18:35,23 --> 00:18:47,12
but a hundred thirty five getting away with it. And the very few times I did.

125
00:18:47,14 --> 00:19:00,21
I'm sure that the wedding cake cost about three times as much as three. But there were people.

126
00:19:00,74 --> 00:19:20,68
You know I can think of some marriages that were like. The one who worked at the time and he had his.

127
00:19:20,7 --> 00:19:30,81
Marriage performed at the throw space place and. There was a lovely spirit there.

128
00:19:30,83 --> 00:19:40,22
And I knew everyone so that made it really. But it seemed to me that the people life. Marriages I performed.

129
00:19:40,23 --> 00:19:53,32
Were from the people from the doctors. And I did a little like a few weeks ago I was going for my poetry.

130
00:19:53,94 --> 00:20:01,17
And I meet this bloke for an early morning. And we pass each other and come back.

131
00:20:01,44 --> 00:20:12,4
He's picked his paper up coming back and he comes up in a front. Back garden.

132
00:20:12,41 --> 00:20:31,78
Well the divorce came through and I swear. And there was a way to go over it. Believe in a bakery. With.

133
00:20:31,8 --> 00:20:37,87
Ross Kelly was the witness for still a schoolteacher.

134
00:20:39,9 --> 00:20:51,33
And I think the wedding breakfast came after they have a beautiful lovely. Well so much for being a wedding celebrant.

135
00:20:51,77 --> 00:21:04,56
And then. During this time. I was. Neville ring ring ring me one day he said look I want you to.

136
00:21:04,58 --> 00:21:12,26
Can you do the job and I said no problem really. He's very special.

137
00:21:15,37 --> 00:21:27,24
And feels will be getting in touch with you all it's hard to say no to naval because of what he did for women in this.

138
00:21:27,26 --> 00:21:33,19
Anyhow. Have a race.

139
00:21:37,88 --> 00:21:45,63
Got a good committee going looking after the very disadvantaged given them and I thought you should sit on this board.

140
00:21:45,65 --> 00:21:55,02
So you know I really want to get up in the morning again. I feel compelled. He says Oh now you can take it easy.

141
00:21:55,25 --> 00:22:12,62
You have a driver. Well that was out of. People who are. So poverty stricken.

142
00:22:12,64 --> 00:22:18,6
That they couldn't wait in the queue for a house. And my job was to assess.

143
00:22:18,87 --> 00:22:28,87
Patients and the hapless cations were always prepared by Gary senior welfare officers who worked for the commission.

144
00:22:29,31 --> 00:22:44,55
Well life went on for years and if every man. And during that period. There was a change of ministers.

145
00:22:46,36 --> 00:23:02,93
And one of Terri Sharon became minister and the chairman invited him down for afternoon tea and Terry came down

146
00:23:02,93 --> 00:23:12,06
and we thought he was great and he was a minister. Very good in fact and he said to me. Now listen face to.

147
00:23:12,08 --> 00:23:22,97
I want you to be a commission. Oh I said that's the last thing I want. But I have never known anyone to say that.

148
00:23:22,98 --> 00:23:27,92
There was a very high sitting fee and you know it was like.

149
00:23:29,2 --> 00:23:36,39
And Terry look how do you think about all I now it's like when a whole lot of poor people come up

150
00:23:37,18 --> 00:23:47,56
and I can sift through the applications and say I think this one is that one. But what I know are bad buildings and.

151
00:23:48,79 --> 00:23:53,47
You just commission. And you do what you believe to be right.

152
00:23:54,77 --> 00:23:59,85
And I didn't last very long as a commissioner it just wasn't my cup of tea.

153
00:24:01,92 --> 00:24:07,9
You were sociate it with a hassling commission went to quite a long time quite a long time so I went back

154
00:24:07,9 --> 00:24:12,14
and I sat on the board that allocated the house.

155
00:24:12,56 --> 00:24:18,12
But during that time they were both two places that were considered to be.

156
00:24:19,62 --> 00:24:26,22
And not only important but prestige as you say and we got very good treatment and the chairman.

157
00:24:26,45 --> 00:24:46,04
The chairman of the commission was like by the name. Kelly. Very well known in labor. It always seemed that he was.

158
00:24:47,36 --> 00:24:57,88
And he spoke to me to the hilt and he would drive to inspect and put me

159
00:24:57,88 --> 00:25:06,13
and my colleague Helen Helen House Rogers on a plane to meet the back. And we would come back.

160
00:25:08,46 --> 00:25:30,06
Inspecting all the houses. And you know we derive. And housing estate and I want to feel.

161
00:25:30,08 --> 00:25:39,95
Really in to tell us oh are you staying overnight here tonight. It was great. It really was. But it did help me.

162
00:25:42,54 --> 00:26:01,58
To understand. The thinking people who are working. Most of us could comfortably came from work. That were narrow.

163
00:26:02,57 --> 00:26:11,83
That was many were so small minded nothing existed that est nothing.

164
00:26:11,85 --> 00:26:26,63
Yet that's exactly when I was having a meal one day. Cup of tea. And you know if I thought yes for.

165
00:26:27,42 --> 00:26:39,21
The working class people the most racist. Because they don't want their little world.

166
00:26:39,22 --> 00:26:52,29
And I found the young white people the most tolerant. But having had this experience with people living in housing he.

167
00:26:52,3 --> 00:27:06,13
Convinces me. There were times when they truly resented me looking at their house. And Kelly was always aware of the.

168
00:27:08,34 --> 00:27:12,89
Great to him but he was an extremely sensitive person.

169
00:27:13,21 --> 00:27:26,38
And he said to me that it was a great eye opener for me that sitting on the boat to allocate to the very disadvantaged

170
00:27:27,43 --> 00:27:39,61
also had a lot to do with. Women who had been. Women who had suffered. Physical violence. And it's very interesting.

171
00:27:40,16 --> 00:27:53,45
I had a woman absolutely beautiful loved.

172
00:27:53,47 --> 00:28:01,01
Just everything half rainy and rainy and she married this chap who was a Christian.

173
00:28:02,86 --> 00:28:09,56
But he soon dropped that he became a confirmed gambler. And an alcoholic and he used to beat her.

174
00:28:11,03 --> 00:28:18,66
And I discussed it in our look. You should never allow anyone to put their finger on you.

175
00:28:18,87 --> 00:28:25,38
And she said well I want to get out of this it was a beautiful house. At Belmont.

176
00:28:25,97 --> 00:28:41,34
And he kept stealing things out of the house to flog them for gambling but. So. I said Would you leave him. Tomorrow.

177
00:28:41,36 --> 00:28:46,73
So I went over to read for my friend brindle who. Had a truck.

178
00:28:47,09 --> 00:29:00,82
And I said Listen Cade going to leave your mind you came was very nice is oh good i have. I BRING ME truck.

179
00:29:02,31 --> 00:29:04,61
It took the truck. Joe Which was it for.

180
00:29:05,7 --> 00:29:13,82
And she put all her treasures into a lovely chair and she had some beautiful things and.

181
00:29:13,84 --> 00:29:24,61
When the truck was well I can get it because I had found her you know for her. And he said. I'm packing.

182
00:29:24,91 --> 00:29:33,32
She will be back. And she was in the next week. So when I went home to the special committee.

183
00:29:33,46 --> 00:29:43,4
This was what was happening with so many of the women who had been brutally beaten. By the house.

184
00:29:45,19 --> 00:29:51,68
We'd allocated and the next thing he would be there.
