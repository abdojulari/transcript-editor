1
00:00:13,87 --> 00:00:17,45
Ok. In 1980.

2
00:00:17,47 --> 00:00:23,38
After the first couple had come
to share the land. We met.

3
00:00:25,49 --> 00:00:29,40
Some others who also were
looking for a place to live.

4
00:00:29,70 --> 00:00:33,37
And build their place in their homes.

5
00:00:33,39 --> 00:00:39,10
And we decided between ourselves.
Ok. They're the right sort.

6
00:00:39,21 --> 00:00:44,79
They were sort of people we'd like to
share the land with. Let's invite them.

7
00:00:46,10 --> 00:00:51,08
So we did so they became the
next the next layer of evil

8
00:00:51,94 --> 00:00:57,40
and. Then there is people.

9
00:00:58,57 --> 00:01:03,09
Members of family brothers
and eventually the parents.

10
00:01:03,77 --> 00:01:06,35
Came.

11
00:01:07,31 --> 00:01:12,86
So that it's a sort of set of
extended families in a way.

12
00:01:13,84 --> 00:01:17,24
But basically it has to be.

13
00:01:17,26 --> 00:01:21,11
People being invited by
the present members.

14
00:01:23,57 --> 00:01:24,60
To come and live here

15
00:01:25,78 --> 00:01:32,60
and not just a matter of of money
tens action like buying a share on

16
00:01:32,60 --> 00:01:37,42
a property. Legally.

17
00:01:37,43 --> 00:01:44,01
We had to live beyond the law as
it were for about eight years.

18
00:01:44,03 --> 00:01:46,96
Which i must confess gave me.

19
00:01:47,78 --> 00:01:49,82
Times when i was very concerned

20
00:01:49,82 --> 00:01:54,87
and worried not only.

21
00:01:55,88 --> 00:01:59,44
The possibility the risk
that was there always that.

22
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:05,22
Something could turn nasty and
the council might come and try

23
00:02:05,22 --> 00:02:08,92
and bulldoze some of the
houses that had been built.

24
00:02:10,62 --> 00:02:12,28
But also the feeling that.

25
00:02:13,62 --> 00:02:20,40
I was technically still the chief
shareholder in the company

26
00:02:20,40 --> 00:02:21,19
which owned the land

27
00:02:22,12 --> 00:02:28,93
and all these people who had
come on our invitation.

28
00:02:30,38 --> 00:02:33,54
Virtually were unprotected by the law.

29
00:02:33,56 --> 00:02:39,52
And the assets that they had put in
the houses they'd built and the trees

30
00:02:39,52 --> 00:02:45,99
that lined. Were technically not theirs.

31
00:02:49,83 --> 00:02:56,34
Fortunately this never amounted
to anything i think other than

32
00:02:56,34 --> 00:02:59,70
a bit of a worry on my part that.

33
00:02:59,72 --> 00:03:02,55
Something unfortunate could happen

34
00:03:02,55 --> 00:03:09,07
that way because by about nineteen eighty
six or seven i'm not quite sure which.

35
00:03:10,29 --> 00:03:11,97
Coble council had at last.

36
00:03:14,97 --> 00:03:21,72
Agreed to accept the possibility
of allowing multiple occupancies

37
00:03:22,53 --> 00:03:29,42
in this particular corner
of their shire. Now they.

38
00:03:30,45 --> 00:03:37,36
So once they were in a position to accept
multiple occupancies as a legal way of

39
00:03:38,06 --> 00:03:42,38
use land use we were able to submit.

40
00:03:43,15 --> 00:03:46,68
Applications for multiple occupancy.

41
00:03:47,44 --> 00:03:51,81
This put them into slight.

42
00:03:51,83 --> 00:03:56,56
Slightly awkward position because
there were already. Say.

43
00:03:56,58 --> 00:03:59,93
Well many many more
houses built on the land.

44
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,17
Then were legally allowed
under the old scheme

45
00:04:05,34 --> 00:04:07,83
but they had enough.

46
00:04:07,85 --> 00:04:08,49
Gentleness

47
00:04:08,49 --> 00:04:15,04
and sense to sort of a pointer
a very decent building

48
00:04:15,05 --> 00:04:20,03
inspector who gave us.

49
00:04:20,05 --> 00:04:23,83
Reasonable. Attention so that.

50
00:04:24,40 --> 00:04:28,69
Although certain aspects of
most of the homes had to have.

51
00:04:28,71 --> 00:04:34,67
Something done to them to bring them up
to his satisfaction and ordinance 70.

52
00:04:36,30 --> 00:04:37,99
We didn't really suffer too much from

53
00:04:39,05 --> 00:04:45,61
that side of complying with the
legal structure. So legally.

54
00:04:46,40 --> 00:04:51,05
Each member of rob road
community has one share.

55
00:04:53,76 --> 00:04:54,58
Has wondered.

56
00:04:57,44 --> 00:05:03,22
And has the right to dispose of his

57
00:05:03,23 --> 00:05:09,79
or her house. And general area.

58
00:05:11,49 --> 00:05:13,61
Like garden private garden

59
00:05:13,61 --> 00:05:19,84
that has been established only
to someone who is approved

60
00:05:21,40 --> 00:05:26,33
by 100 per cent of the
rest of the community.

61
00:05:28,07 --> 00:05:33,93
We have had one situation where
this is already happened.

62
00:05:35,39 --> 00:05:42,29
It did pose a problem for this for the
people who wanted to move away because they

63
00:05:42,30 --> 00:05:45,22
couldn't sell their thing. Their
house on the open market.

64
00:05:47,00 --> 00:05:52,41
They couldn't ask as much as they
would have got on the open market.

65
00:05:52,95 --> 00:05:59,82
And it took them. Much longer
probably than it would have this.

66
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,80
They had just left it on the open market.

67
00:06:04,98 --> 00:06:11,41
But this is something we all agreed to
nisha lee that these are the conditions.

68
00:06:11,43 --> 00:06:16,67
So that i mean that there are
some disadvantages in that sense.

69
00:06:16,78 --> 00:06:18,13
This is not an investment.

70
00:06:19,34 --> 00:06:21,10
It's a place to live in

71
00:06:21,10 --> 00:06:26,92
that.

72
00:06:28,10 --> 00:06:32,85
You know. Very high priority.

73
00:06:32,87 --> 00:06:37,39
Yes it's very important to us that.

74
00:06:37,41 --> 00:06:43,56
We we we've always tried
to put relationships among

75
00:06:43,57 --> 00:06:49,37
community members. Absolutely.
At the top priority.

76
00:06:51,77 --> 00:06:57,05
Doesn't matter about anything else
really. If your relationship.

77
00:06:57,07 --> 00:06:58,77
Are good

78
00:07:00,97 --> 00:07:07,08
and of course the longer
you can lives. And share.

79
00:07:09,28 --> 00:07:13,98
This live beside each other and
share. The land or anything.

80
00:07:14,12 --> 00:07:19,43
The longer you can do
that. Amicably. The more.

81
00:07:19,45 --> 00:07:22,08
Easy it becomes so

82
00:07:22,09 --> 00:07:26,94
that now i think there
is a very strong bond.

83
00:07:29,06 --> 00:07:29,51
A bonding

84
00:07:29,51 --> 00:07:35,75
that is sort of you know getting towards
something like you get between brothers

85
00:07:35,75 --> 00:07:38,55
and sisters or family.

86
00:07:39,32 --> 00:07:40,00
I hesitate to use

87
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:46,78
that word family because it's become
rather a potentially nasty label in some

88
00:07:47,78 --> 00:07:52,60
communities isn't it. But it certainly.

89
00:07:54,38 --> 00:07:59,49
Seems to work that. There's a good
deal of support for each other.

90
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,97
If somebody sick. Somebody. Well
when when anyone has a baby.

91
00:08:05,99 --> 00:08:10,32
They the tradition has
become that they get.

92
00:08:11,64 --> 00:08:13,45
A meal and evening meal prepared

93
00:08:13,45 --> 00:08:19,58
and delivered for a fortnight
after the birth and we take it.

94
00:08:19,64 --> 00:08:23,57
We just take it in turns to do that

95
00:08:23,57 --> 00:08:28,42
and i mean that's that's
nothing but there's.

96
00:08:28,43 --> 00:08:33,63
There's lots of other support sort of
awareness of each other and awareness of.

97
00:08:33,65 --> 00:08:38,63
Shopping needs transport needs health.

98
00:08:40,37 --> 00:08:49,08
It's it's it's very good.

99
00:08:50,13 --> 00:08:54,19
Actually we share less and less now it's.

100
00:08:54,21 --> 00:08:56,66
Ideally you know i must confess

101
00:08:56,66 --> 00:09:03,41
that at first i thought community i thought
working side by side in the gardens.

102
00:09:03,67 --> 00:09:04,72
You know producing things

103
00:09:04,72 --> 00:09:10,74
and working together on projects be great.

104
00:09:11,96 --> 00:09:19,94
Now we come together for social
reasons parties birthdays.

105
00:09:19,96 --> 00:09:24,68
We come together to swim in our big dam.

106
00:09:24,70 --> 00:09:29,50
In summer which is a lovely escape place.

107
00:09:30,86 --> 00:09:37,27
We come together. On those unfortunate
occasions when we get aground so notice.

108
00:09:38,80 --> 00:09:39,27
And all

109
00:09:39,27 --> 00:09:49,02
and have to show some signs of doing
something to placate the rather.

110
00:09:51,86 --> 00:09:58,50
In our minds rather absurd requests
to eradicate this plant that is.

111
00:09:58,52 --> 00:09:59,72
Of of.

112
00:10:00,84 --> 00:10:03,85
The potential danger to some people

113
00:10:03,85 --> 00:10:08,27
or some graziers anyway.

114
00:10:09,17 --> 00:10:16,85
We come together is is there
is a request to come together.

115
00:10:16,87 --> 00:10:23,09
But we have a monthly
meeting to discuss various

116
00:10:23,94 --> 00:10:26,77
business.

117
00:10:27,50 --> 00:10:31,53
Usually attended by steps.

118
00:10:31,55 --> 00:10:36,53
20 per cent maybe sometimes 30
40 per cent of the people but.

119
00:10:36,54 --> 00:10:41,36
Very rarely that it's
everybody comes to meetings.

120
00:10:44,05 --> 00:10:50,51
People change.

121
00:10:50,52 --> 00:10:52,74
People.

122
00:10:54,64 --> 00:10:59,06
Ah yes i do think that it's
changed over the years.

123
00:10:59,08 --> 00:11:03,79
At first we did i think share an ideal.

124
00:11:03,81 --> 00:11:08,37
Or a fantasy that you know we
would be working side by side

125
00:11:08,37 --> 00:11:11,17
and we did have a community
garden going for a while

126
00:11:12,21 --> 00:11:16,18
and it just.

127
00:11:16,20 --> 00:11:23,28
It seemed not to be the way we as people.

128
00:11:23,30 --> 00:11:29,21
Worked best as people moved
into their own homes.

129
00:11:30,94 --> 00:11:37,61
Which was separate from each other they
found it was more successful more useful to

130
00:11:37,61 --> 00:11:40,98
have their own gardens near their houses.

131
00:11:41,44 --> 00:11:43,93
Then they could choose
what they wanted to plant.

132
00:11:44,37 --> 00:11:51,02
They wouldn't have to go sort of
three hundred yards away carrying

133
00:11:51,02 --> 00:11:55,78
that to lose it it has just generally.

134
00:11:55,79 --> 00:11:59,93
Changed that that side of
things is very much chad.

135
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,55
And we used to run the shop for
ourselves. Come to think of it.

136
00:12:03,65 --> 00:12:10,74
We had we we did weekly
purchasing we had bins full of.

137
00:12:10,75 --> 00:12:12,29
Gosh.

138
00:12:12,30 --> 00:12:19,80
So chickpeas we'd organic we'd of course.

139
00:12:19,82 --> 00:12:25,99
We had a great week. Grinding meal because
we all made our own bread it's first.

140
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:32,76
Things changed. We've found that.

141
00:12:32,77 --> 00:12:39,75
I. I think it was partly that. The
payment system we had a book.

142
00:12:39,77 --> 00:12:46,21
We ended everything in. But there was
they really enough money in the kitty.

143
00:12:47,47 --> 00:12:53,16
When we came to do the next lot of
purchasing not because anybody had been

144
00:12:53,17 --> 00:12:55,82
dishonest or had it's just that

145
00:12:55,82 --> 00:12:59,57
that wasn't convenient for
them to pay at the time so

146
00:12:59,58 --> 00:13:05,54
that over a period of a couple of years of
trying to run these things for ourselves.

147
00:13:06,81 --> 00:13:11,13
We decided that it just
would be easier at the.

148
00:13:11,43 --> 00:13:17,19
That time to let it go. You know.

149
00:13:18,48 --> 00:13:20,74
You.

150
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:29,42
Make.

151
00:13:31,82 --> 00:13:37,98
I think we probably have

152
00:13:39,16 --> 00:13:46,90
each come to our own assessment
of her own energy levels.

153
00:13:48,44 --> 00:13:55,27
And have found that it's. More convenient.

154
00:13:57,66 --> 00:14:00,41
To do things under our. Stay.

155
00:14:00,76 --> 00:14:06,40
Rather than to try to
combine with each other.

156
00:14:07,03 --> 00:14:13,20
The amount of energy needed to
organize say a shopping list among.

157
00:14:13,22 --> 00:14:19,87
20 people each week to do the

158
00:14:19,87 --> 00:14:25,25
purchasing two is to
distribute the product

159
00:14:25,25 --> 00:14:30,33
and to get the pay back to get
the money for the next weeks.

160
00:14:30,34 --> 00:14:30,80
All of

161
00:14:30,80 --> 00:14:39,03
that energy just seemed to be too
much for any one person to take on.

162
00:14:39,05 --> 00:14:45,89
So it has boiled down to each family seems

163
00:14:45,90 --> 00:14:50,52
to have its own. Transport system anyway.

164
00:14:51,20 --> 00:14:57,47
Has to go to the shops
some time during a week

165
00:14:59,09 --> 00:15:00,38
or fortnight.

166
00:15:01,30 --> 00:15:06,26
It just has boiled down to the fact that
each individual family now does it.

167
00:15:07,51 --> 00:15:09,69
Does that side of things good self.

168
00:15:10,65 --> 00:15:17,82
Mind you if we go to a major
crisis in the petrol supply.

169
00:15:17,84 --> 00:15:23,00
Or a major shift in the whole
economic system so that.

170
00:15:23,52 --> 00:15:29,71
There is a lot less money to go around
and a lot less petrol to go around.

171
00:15:29,73 --> 00:15:34,94
I wouldn't be surprised if we wouldn't
be forced to get back into some sort of

172
00:15:34,94 --> 00:15:37,32
system like that again.

173
00:15:38,43 --> 00:15:43,33
So i can't say that it's due to personal.

174
00:15:43,35 --> 00:15:46,85
Laziness or or.

175
00:15:47,81 --> 00:15:50,92
Just failure of that idea or.

176
00:15:50,94 --> 00:15:52,63
It's just the way things

177
00:15:52,63 --> 00:15:59,44
that happened in our circumstances.

178
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,32
Yes.

179
00:16:02,05 --> 00:16:07,64
Or is it really become

180
00:16:09,98 --> 00:16:11,92
something.

181
00:16:11,94 --> 00:16:18,49
At at my darkest moments were
just very often i used to think.

182
00:16:19,57 --> 00:16:22,61
This is just another suburban.

183
00:16:25,69 --> 00:16:28,18
Plot.

184
00:16:30,06 --> 00:16:35,68
I think know that it's moved
beyond that. I think we've.

185
00:16:37,06 --> 00:16:44,04
It's the community side of things
the support of each member for each

186
00:16:44,05 --> 00:16:48,98
other member. Perhaps that
support isn't called for.

187
00:16:51,39 --> 00:16:58,01
More than very occasionally but
when i was sort of where to go.

188
00:16:58,03 --> 00:17:04,85
If you need something or if you need
a shoulder to cry on or if you need.

189
00:17:04,87 --> 00:17:12,53
Some information for fixing something.

190
00:17:12,55 --> 00:17:19,41
I think i think one of the
values in this community is

191
00:17:19,42 --> 00:17:24,96
that you is enough range of skills. Sorry.

192
00:17:26,73 --> 00:17:26,84
To.

193
00:17:29,92 --> 00:17:35,13
The community can offer us. Yes.

194
00:17:35,81 --> 00:17:41,67
It certainly is a feeling that
we want to support each other.

195
00:17:42,06 --> 00:17:48,01
When anything happens to any individual.

196
00:17:48,84 --> 00:17:53,74
There is there's of course is
support if anybody's sick or hurt.

197
00:17:53,75 --> 00:17:59,37
Or if as occasionally happens
there are sort of relationship.

198
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:06,22
Problems or breakdowns. There's not.

199
00:18:07,35 --> 00:18:13,03
There's not blame there's just support
for each individual because of course we

200
00:18:13,03 --> 00:18:14,43
like each individual.

201
00:18:16,12 --> 00:18:24,97
This is sounding like a
sunday school something.

202
00:18:24,99 --> 00:18:28,18
Situation.

203
00:18:32,08 --> 00:18:35,32
Personally i don't think
it does it may well be

204
00:18:35,32 --> 00:18:38,46
that some some individuals think

205
00:18:39,30 --> 00:18:44,92
that person ought to behave themselves in
which case it's it's their responsibility

206
00:18:44,92 --> 00:18:50,10
to say that to that person
and not say to anybody else.

207
00:18:50,11 --> 00:18:53,17
That this is something
that we've tried to.

208
00:18:53,91 --> 00:19:00,70
Follow all along is if i have a grudge
against somebody else in the community.

209
00:19:01,19 --> 00:19:08,08
Or if i think they're doing something i
don't like i have tried to say to myself

210
00:19:11,14 --> 00:19:15,10
is this worthwhile just
accepting ok that's them.

211
00:19:15,20 --> 00:19:20,15
That's the way they like to do things
or is it better for me to go to

212
00:19:20,15 --> 00:19:26,36
that person and because they know
me i know them as a friend say.

213
00:19:26,38 --> 00:19:31,49
I don't like that or why
are you doing that or i'm.

214
00:19:31,50 --> 00:19:38,33
You wake me up in the mornings when you do
that. You know just to make each other.

215
00:19:38,34 --> 00:19:43,81
Aware if there is something
that is irritating.

216
00:19:43,83 --> 00:19:46,90
And then it's up to us
as individuals to work

217
00:19:46,90 --> 00:19:52,66
that out between us what we try
to avoid and eyes. Think of.

218
00:19:55,01 --> 00:20:01,62
Successfully is huge huge. Talking about.

219
00:20:02,94 --> 00:20:09,69
That irritations caused by one person
talking about that to other people.

220
00:20:11,29 --> 00:20:13,90
So that then it starts going
around and round in circles.

221
00:20:15,76 --> 00:20:17,97
So i think that's one way that.

222
00:20:19,05 --> 00:20:25,20
Perhaps we've tried to keep. Each other.

223
00:20:25,35 --> 00:20:30,98
Aware of where we're
possibly going against

224
00:20:32,28 --> 00:20:38,29
another soul in the community. I guess.

225
00:20:38,31 --> 00:20:46,94
A stable population so.

226
00:20:46,95 --> 00:20:52,92
Yes. Yes it has had this
fairly stable population.

227
00:20:52,94 --> 00:20:59,55
Although there have been people who
have moved away for. Very good reasons.

228
00:20:59,72 --> 00:21:03,12
There hasn't been any big blow ups

229
00:21:03,12 --> 00:21:08,32
or any sort of emotional strife

230
00:21:08,32 --> 00:21:12,21
that seems to have caused people
to move away. They've moved away.

231
00:21:12,23 --> 00:21:15,32
For economic reasons
or for health reasons.

232
00:21:21,66 --> 00:21:25,82
One of the challenges. You know.

233
00:21:25,84 --> 00:21:30,81
So.

234
00:21:32,09 --> 00:21:37,32
Yes to be economically
sustainable is is quite a.

235
00:21:38,15 --> 00:21:44,06
A mouthful isn't it. It's quite a a
and that cheeseman i guess we've.

236
00:21:44,73 --> 00:21:49,15
Ideally we wanted that to be happening.

237
00:21:50,25 --> 00:21:56,99
It's taken much longer than i ever
hoped never thought it would but.

238
00:21:57,01 --> 00:22:01,91
I think that it's. It's been happening.

239
00:22:01,93 --> 00:22:06,72
Over the last several years now

240
00:22:06,72 --> 00:22:12,62
that people have become more and more.

241
00:22:12,63 --> 00:22:17,93
Independent of any form
of government support.

242
00:22:18,72 --> 00:22:23,50
There is still a few people on
the place who are pensioners

243
00:22:23,50 --> 00:22:27,33
or unmarried mothers or you know.

244
00:22:27,85 --> 00:22:32,68
Single parents with on welfare. But.

245
00:22:33,33 --> 00:22:37,35
On the whole most of the craft people

246
00:22:37,35 --> 00:22:43,44
and the musicians have found
which is that they can work in

247
00:22:44,21 --> 00:22:49,04
that will bring in a viable income.

248
00:22:49,06 --> 00:22:54,63
So although it's taken longer than
i'd hoped or with all hoped. It.

249
00:22:54,90 --> 00:22:58,94
It is happening and it's i think.

250
00:22:58,96 --> 00:23:05,26
Another another sort of effect of
not having to pay rent of having

251
00:23:06,53 --> 00:23:12,67
a reasonably adequate. Sort
of. Place to live in. Now.

252
00:23:13,14 --> 00:23:19,16
Each family seems to have built
their own home gradually

253
00:23:20,28 --> 00:23:25,23
taking a long time and with a lot of
effort since none of them was you know.

254
00:23:25,69 --> 00:23:27,25
A qualify builder to begin with.

255
00:23:29,46 --> 00:23:35,30
But now they've each got a reasonably
comfortable and sound place to live in.

256
00:23:36,34 --> 00:23:41,49
Which is without a mortgage and
without no overhead costs.

257
00:23:43,79 --> 00:23:44,06
So that

258
00:23:44,06 --> 00:23:51,32
that in itself helps to make it possible to
make a living out of either the kraftwerk

259
00:23:51,32 --> 00:23:58,15
or the music. To show.

260
00:24:02,10 --> 00:24:06,54
Sure. So.

261
00:24:06,56 --> 00:24:12,53
I think. You know person. Oh really.

262
00:24:14,59 --> 00:24:19,21
I would have you know really
well i would i've been there

263
00:24:20,69 --> 00:24:27,28
but. Sometimes yes yes. Oh
there are cliches sage.

264
00:24:27,48 --> 00:24:34,03
Yeah. That. I tell you. Bruce mcnichol
be a good one to talk to about that.

265
00:24:34,22 --> 00:24:37,96
Do you know him as a he is a musician and.
