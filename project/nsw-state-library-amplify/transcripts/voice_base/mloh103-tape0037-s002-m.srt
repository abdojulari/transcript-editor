1
00:00:13,84 --> 00:00:18,22
Can you tell us a bit about what happens
during those three days in the car if we

2
00:00:18,22 --> 00:00:21,30
will all beings what are people actually
do to get to come around to that.

3
00:00:21,44 --> 00:00:24,49
Well why do you. First
of all i have to say

4
00:00:24,49 --> 00:00:28,64
that the council of all beings
can consist of almost anything

5
00:00:28,64 --> 00:00:32,77
that is congruent with those ideas

6
00:00:32,77 --> 00:00:37,13
that i've expressed of being in harmony
with the earth that what we've found is

7
00:00:37,13 --> 00:00:38,84
that it's the intention

8
00:00:38,84 --> 00:00:42,54
that any time a group of people
gathers together for a few hours

9
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:44,86
or a few days to share with each other.

10
00:00:45,29 --> 00:00:50,70
That ending of the illusion of separation
from the earth to share with each other

11
00:00:50,70 --> 00:00:55,81
our love for the earth and our
desire to be more powerful

12
00:00:55,82 --> 00:00:58,49
and more empowered in the
defense of the earth.

13
00:00:59,06 --> 00:01:01,82
This miracle takes place
that we experience this

14
00:01:01,82 --> 00:01:07,60
that we experience an awakening that
we experience an embodiment of this.

15
00:01:07,61 --> 00:01:10,54
But having said that the
particular council of all beings

16
00:01:10,54 --> 00:01:12,14
that i lead you know so different.

17
00:01:12,18 --> 00:01:15,61
There are hundreds of people now that
facilitate these workshops around the world.

18
00:01:15,75 --> 00:01:20,61
I just did in the last eight months
i've done like 20 in the united states

19
00:01:20,61 --> 00:01:24,98
and half a dozen in russia and others
in holland and finn horn in scotland

20
00:01:24,98 --> 00:01:27,32
and other places and.

21
00:01:27,33 --> 00:01:29,92
Everywhere people are studying with me

22
00:01:29,92 --> 00:01:33,83
and studying with each other how to do
this and everyone can do it differently.

23
00:01:33,95 --> 00:01:35,74
You know but the way that i do it.

24
00:01:35,78 --> 00:01:40,66
We usually start with the intention we make
our intention very clear because that's

25
00:01:40,66 --> 00:01:43,65
what the whole experience
is based on then.

26
00:01:45,25 --> 00:01:50,38
We may go into various processes that
help us to feel bonded with each other

27
00:01:50,38 --> 00:01:54,33
and feel safe with each other
then we go into a mourning

28
00:01:54,33 --> 00:01:57,09
or grieving process because
what we've found is

29
00:01:57,09 --> 00:02:01,44
that unless we are prepared to
feel. All the pain of the earth.

30
00:02:01,64 --> 00:02:07,71
We can't really be empowered in the healing
of the earth as long as we deny the

31
00:02:07,72 --> 00:02:13,00
feeling quality of what's going on and
so long as we deny the pain and horror

32
00:02:13,77 --> 00:02:18,61
and the despair and the rage at what's
going on which all of us feel deep down

33
00:02:18,61 --> 00:02:22,88
but most of us repress then we're
kind of numb to what's going on.

34
00:02:23,07 --> 00:02:28,76
So we invite ourselves to feel those
things and. From there we go.

35
00:02:28,88 --> 00:02:33,73
Perhaps to an evil lucian airy remembering
where we re-enact the evolutionary drama

36
00:02:33,73 --> 00:02:39,26
from the big bang matter and
space and time being created

37
00:02:39,26 --> 00:02:44,12
and the creation of galaxies and then
our own galaxy the milky way and within

38
00:02:44,12 --> 00:02:48,08
that the sun and its planets and
then on the earth the earth cooling

39
00:02:48,08 --> 00:02:49,73
and the crust forming

40
00:02:49,73 --> 00:02:55,76
and the development the
first cell evolution of

41
00:02:55,76 --> 00:03:00,72
that cell through the oceans you know like
90 per cent of organic life was in the

42
00:03:00,72 --> 00:03:04,31
oceans and in the last 10
per cent of the time we.

43
00:03:04,32 --> 00:03:09,35
And phoebe ins came to the earth became
reptiles and then some of those reptiles.

44
00:03:09,65 --> 00:03:13,72
Their scales turned to feathers
and they became the birds

45
00:03:13,72 --> 00:03:17,62
and other reptiles their scales turned
fur and they became the mantles and

46
00:03:17,62 --> 00:03:21,15
that was our line and we
just trace back our story.

47
00:03:21,18 --> 00:03:24,30
But now it's not just written
history that we're identifying with

48
00:03:24,30 --> 00:03:28,80
but our whole story the story that's in our
d in a that's in every cell it's in our

49
00:03:28,80 --> 00:03:34,21
blood and we try and embody that as
much as we can and and experience

50
00:03:34,21 --> 00:03:36,78
that not just as being another
story that we learn at school

51
00:03:37,47 --> 00:03:39,81
but that's my story
that's my creation myth.

52
00:03:39,97 --> 00:03:45,26
I wasn't created by an old man
with a white beard 4000 years ago.

53
00:03:45,28 --> 00:03:49,97
You know i've been here before thousand
million years evolving on this earth do you

54
00:03:49,97 --> 00:03:56,38
know and just to leave that out and
then finally we find an ally in nature

55
00:03:56,38 --> 00:03:59,95
and non human being that
wishes to speak through our.

56
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,71
Yes in the council of all beings
it may be an animal or a plant

57
00:04:03,71 --> 00:04:08,18
or some you know it may be the
rain or the sky some natural.

58
00:04:08,63 --> 00:04:10,63
Anything but a human being
anything on the earth

59
00:04:10,63 --> 00:04:13,10
but human we know all about
what humans have got to say

60
00:04:13,10 --> 00:04:17,71
but all of these are these are the
voiceless ones they're the ones that.

61
00:04:17,73 --> 00:04:20,55
Our culture doesn't hear anymore
in fact we don't even believe

62
00:04:20,55 --> 00:04:23,84
that they have any voice we think
that they're just like machines

63
00:04:23,84 --> 00:04:26,38
and so you know we treat
animals like machines

64
00:04:26,38 --> 00:04:28,43
and plants like machines
they have no soul.

65
00:04:28,51 --> 00:04:31,58
They have no feelings and the fact

66
00:04:31,58 --> 00:04:35,10
that they've been evolving alongside of
us for 4000 million years is ignored.

67
00:04:35,23 --> 00:04:39,28
So we find an ally and then we
make a mask to represent that ally

68
00:04:39,28 --> 00:04:43,06
and then finally we gather in the
council of all beings with our masks on

69
00:04:43,06 --> 00:04:47,68
and we just invite our personality to
get out of the way for a little while

70
00:04:47,68 --> 00:04:51,51
and we spontaneously invite
this being to speak through us

71
00:04:52,25 --> 00:04:55,21
and no matter how cynical or
sceptical we might be to start with

72
00:04:55,21 --> 00:04:58,25
and of course most people
from the modern world.

73
00:04:58,62 --> 00:05:03,39
You know i'd be very very surprised if
anyone came to the council of all beings for

74
00:05:03,39 --> 00:05:07,42
the first time without being highly sceptical
about what was going to happen maybe

75
00:05:07,42 --> 00:05:12,32
this is just psychodrama maybe this is
just a projection of our own personalities

76
00:05:12,32 --> 00:05:17,40
but always everyone is incredibly
moved by what takes place

77
00:05:17,40 --> 00:05:21,47
and it's different every time but always
we hear voices either from ourselves

78
00:05:21,47 --> 00:05:25,52
or from each other that we've never
heard before with incredible wisdom

79
00:05:25,52 --> 00:05:28,94
and points of view that are totally
alien to what we've ever heard before

80
00:05:29,68 --> 00:05:30,49
and it makes us realize

81
00:05:30,49 --> 00:05:35,94
that we can then speak for the earth because
we've heard the earth we if we've had

82
00:05:35,94 --> 00:05:38,11
an authentic experience
that we really believe

83
00:05:38,11 --> 00:05:41,52
that we've heard the earth speaking through
these other beings even through our own

84
00:05:41,52 --> 00:05:46,15
voice then it's really easy
to go up to parliament house

85
00:05:46,86 --> 00:05:50,92
and you know have someone say well look
you know my constituency represents

86
00:05:50,92 --> 00:05:53,97
thousands and thousands of people
who are you to tell me what to do

87
00:05:53,97 --> 00:05:57,86
and we can say this in my
constituency represent.

88
00:05:58,28 --> 00:05:59,51
Hundreds of thousands and millions.

89
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:00,62
Species

90
00:06:00,62 --> 00:06:03,72
and they're not even represented in your
parliament you know they're not even

91
00:06:03,72 --> 00:06:05,55
represented and i speak for them.

92
00:06:05,73 --> 00:06:09,61
You know and to speak with a strong
voice because you know we know

93
00:06:09,61 --> 00:06:14,42
that we're speaking for these voiceless
ones these you know the rest of creation

94
00:06:14,42 --> 00:06:15,66
which is being ignored.

95
00:06:16,15 --> 00:06:22,24
Which is being shoved out of the way and
the thing is that once we recognize that.

96
00:06:22,25 --> 00:06:27,80
In spite of the 2000 years of
judeo-christian you know belief or 4000

97
00:06:27,80 --> 00:06:30,38
or whatever it is years of believing

98
00:06:30,38 --> 00:06:33,53
that the world is a pyramid with
human beings on the top and

99
00:06:33,53 --> 00:06:37,22
that the world just consists of human
beings and resources do you know

100
00:06:37,22 --> 00:06:41,51
that it's just there for our satisfaction
in spite of that it's not true.

101
00:06:41,73 --> 00:06:45,93
The world is more like a web and we
humans are one strand in that web

102
00:06:45,93 --> 00:06:50,40
and if we destroy those other species
then we destroy ourselves so we all know

103
00:06:50,40 --> 00:06:52,58
that to be true but we
don't know how to live

104
00:06:52,58 --> 00:06:54,75
that truth we don't know
how to change our lives

105
00:06:54,75 --> 00:06:58,02
and the council of all
beings is a way of bringing

106
00:06:58,02 --> 00:06:59,72
that truth to life bringing it home

107
00:07:00,45 --> 00:07:05,09
and changing ourselves not on the level
of ideas but on the level of values

108
00:07:05,09 --> 00:07:09,10
and on the level of
lifestyle and behavior.

109
00:07:09,11 --> 00:07:14,15
Ok what about the term sorry earthing
and very gendering who believe

110
00:07:14,15 --> 00:07:14,76
that something else

111
00:07:14,76 --> 00:07:20,18
that you've been forefront of well these
are there's a similar amount i started

112
00:07:20,18 --> 00:07:23,21
going. Yeah ok so really a
thing and regenerating.

113
00:07:23,24 --> 00:07:28,43
Two other workshop forms that
i've developed with many friends

114
00:07:28,43 --> 00:07:30,34
that i work with on these things

115
00:07:30,34 --> 00:07:37,07
and these are used efren techniques
to bring about the same effect of a

116
00:07:37,07 --> 00:07:40,82
deep experience of cooperation

117
00:07:40,82 --> 00:07:47,12
and communion with the planet in these
workshops we use the breath to bring us deep

118
00:07:47,12 --> 00:07:51,35
into parts of ourselves
and levels of ourselves

119
00:07:51,35 --> 00:07:56,45
that we usually unconscious of
these techniques are based on a.

120
00:07:57,17 --> 00:07:59,90
Therapy that's called
rebirthing where the breath is.

121
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,66
So used to bring unconscious material from
the personal part of our unconscious you

122
00:08:06,66 --> 00:08:10,03
know things connected with traumas
that we had early on in our lives

123
00:08:10,03 --> 00:08:12,31
that we've forgotten
about and repressed and

124
00:08:12,31 --> 00:08:14,28
when we remember them a
healing takes place.

125
00:08:14,46 --> 00:08:18,98
So by adding a planetary intention
and a deep ecology perspective

126
00:08:18,98 --> 00:08:25,85
and some other things these other forms
allow us to bring this other area

127
00:08:25,85 --> 00:08:28,81
that we're totally unconscious
of which is our organic nature.

128
00:08:29,13 --> 00:08:33,12
I mean freud found 100 years ago that
we were unconscious of our sexuality

129
00:08:33,12 --> 00:08:35,23
but that's the tiniest part of it.

130
00:08:35,30 --> 00:08:39,38
We're unconscious of our organic
being we're unconscious of the fact

131
00:08:39,38 --> 00:08:41,54
that we've been evolving
here for thousands

132
00:08:41,54 --> 00:08:45,48
and millions of years we are
unconscious of the fact that the food

133
00:08:45,48 --> 00:08:51,93
that we eat means that the earth is
our body that every time we place.

134
00:08:51,95 --> 00:08:56,46
You know it's like there's this
incredible cycle where the earth somehow

135
00:08:56,46 --> 00:09:00,99
miraculously grows these things and
we take these things from the earth

136
00:09:00,99 --> 00:09:06,30
and we place them inside our body and they
become our body and then we take a shit.

137
00:09:06,64 --> 00:09:10,06
And the earth in our body goes
back into the earth again

138
00:09:10,06 --> 00:09:13,11
and there is this
incredible cycle of earth.

139
00:09:13,38 --> 00:09:15,93
Which is flowing through
us streaming through us

140
00:09:15,93 --> 00:09:19,60
and we just started out as this
tiny cell in our mother's body

141
00:09:19,60 --> 00:09:23,77
and we grew there from this earth and
we came out of our mother's body

142
00:09:23,77 --> 00:09:26,71
and we grew and grew and
we are made of earth.

143
00:09:27,21 --> 00:09:29,69
Now this is in controversial i don't think

144
00:09:29,69 --> 00:09:33,70
but we don't experience ourselves in this
way. This isn't part of our identity.

145
00:09:33,75 --> 00:09:37,56
Same with the water. There's
this incredible cycle.

146
00:09:37,58 --> 00:09:41,13
Where water is lifted up
by the sun and it falls

147
00:09:41,13 --> 00:09:42,98
and on its way down it lubricates

148
00:09:42,98 --> 00:09:46,13
and creates all of life
including us a tiny part of

149
00:09:46,13 --> 00:09:50,18
that water passes through our body
becomes our blood and all of our fluids

150
00:09:50,18 --> 00:09:53,06
and then we piece it out
back into the cycle again

151
00:09:53,91 --> 00:09:58,36
and the air cycle is the same so we
are the intersection of these cycles

152
00:09:58,36 --> 00:09:59,95
and if we have a prefer.

153
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,77
Found experience of that as being
actually that is who i am.

154
00:10:03,95 --> 00:10:09,04
Do you know i'm not some disembodied
spirit that somehow trapped in this body.

155
00:10:09,35 --> 00:10:11,28
You know i wasn't brought
here from outer space.

156
00:10:11,68 --> 00:10:14,72
I am an earthling i'm
part of this if we feel

157
00:10:14,72 --> 00:10:18,72
that deeply then it changes the way
that we behave it changes the way

158
00:10:18,72 --> 00:10:19,82
that we think so.

159
00:10:19,87 --> 00:10:24,09
Re earthing and regenerating a ways
of bringing about those changes so

160
00:10:24,09 --> 00:10:28,46
that we spontaneously through the breath
have an experience the changes our

161
00:10:28,46 --> 00:10:34,35
identity. Do you feel like you're
developed to help develop a new religion

162
00:10:34,35 --> 00:10:37,27
or just help people rediscover old ones.

163
00:10:38,21 --> 00:10:40,99
Well it's it's very it's certainly
it's certainly an old one

164
00:10:40,99 --> 00:10:44,46
but in this case i think that it's not
just thrown i don't get is that again.

165
00:10:44,47 --> 00:10:46,67
Yep yep.

166
00:10:47,39 --> 00:10:51,49
I think that there is a new
religion that's being born here

167
00:10:52,53 --> 00:10:55,02
but it's not just religion.

168
00:10:55,04 --> 00:11:01,44
It's it's it's very much in harmony with
all of the findings of science at this

169
00:11:01,44 --> 00:11:02,65
time. Do you know and

170
00:11:02,65 --> 00:11:08,79
that it's also not very new because
this is rediscovering things

171
00:11:08,79 --> 00:11:10,76
that our ancestors knew about

172
00:11:10,76 --> 00:11:15,29
and in particular it's rediscovering
a lot of the things that were.

173
00:11:17,12 --> 00:11:24,00
That were deliberately and violently
repressed in our society by.

174
00:11:24,02 --> 00:11:27,86
Thousands of years of
judeo-christian conditioning

175
00:11:27,86 --> 00:11:30,95
and most recently perhaps
by the inquisitions.

176
00:11:31,57 --> 00:11:36,27
When nine million european women were burned
at the stake for their love of nature

177
00:11:36,27 --> 00:11:38,75
and for their belief that
the earth was alive and

178
00:11:38,75 --> 00:11:42,89
that the world didn't belong
to men and to the spirit but

179
00:11:42,89 --> 00:11:47,77
that the earth belonged to you know all
people into the body and to itself.

180
00:11:48,02 --> 00:11:50,67
You know and so the ritual
and ceremonial life

181
00:11:50,67 --> 00:11:55,32
that allows us to experience ourselves
as part of the earth was repressed at

182
00:11:55,32 --> 00:11:58,73
that time. What then.

183
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:01,68
Of people who you know who would say

184
00:12:01,68 --> 00:12:05,02
that what we've just been listening to for
now you know there's a lot of old hippy

185
00:12:05,02 --> 00:12:06,10
drivel.

186
00:12:07,40 --> 00:12:11,70
Well you know i feel a little bit
sorry for them because i feel myself

187
00:12:11,70 --> 00:12:14,58
and i don't start again. Yeah.

188
00:12:14,60 --> 00:12:18,12
Well for those people
who feel that you know

189
00:12:18,12 --> 00:12:21,33
that all of this is just a
load of old hippy drivel.

190
00:12:21,56 --> 00:12:26,64
I feel a bit sorry for them because i
feel that there's a remarkable challenge

191
00:12:26,64 --> 00:12:30,88
and a remarkable opportunity at this
time for human beings to get real.

192
00:12:31,08 --> 00:12:34,29
You know to get in harmony with
the earth. If we don't do it.

193
00:12:34,40 --> 00:12:36,01
We're going to be destroyed

194
00:12:36,01 --> 00:12:41,57
and it's an amazing thing to have been
living here on this earth for 4000 million

195
00:12:41,57 --> 00:12:46,70
years to have survived the most incredible
challenges can you imagine our ancestors

196
00:12:46,70 --> 00:12:49,46
the fish learning to walk on the land.

197
00:12:49,57 --> 00:12:51,52
You know the incredible challenges

198
00:12:51,52 --> 00:12:57,90
that we faced of our ancestors
surviving ice age after ice age

199
00:12:57,90 --> 00:13:03,49
and all of them survivors all of them
finding a way through passing this precious

200
00:13:03,49 --> 00:13:06,20
precious flame of life from fin.

201
00:13:06,50 --> 00:13:12,47
To claw to paw and into our own hands
and then now we're going to fumble

202
00:13:12,47 --> 00:13:15,15
and let it drop. You know what i
mean it's an incredible thing.

203
00:13:15,44 --> 00:13:20,28
And so i feel to show people to be
so busy playing it business as usual

204
00:13:20,28 --> 00:13:23,19
and holding on to those stupid ideas

205
00:13:23,19 --> 00:13:26,60
that we've developed in the last
few thousand years and letting

206
00:13:26,60 --> 00:13:30,76
that beautiful flame drop for what
you know for a microwave oven

207
00:13:30,76 --> 00:13:35,27
and a second car and an electric
toothbrush you know such a shame.

208
00:13:35,30 --> 00:13:37,71
So i just feel sorry for them and.

209
00:13:37,73 --> 00:13:40,37
I myself don't believe that
the earth is going to die.

210
00:13:40,40 --> 00:13:45,46
I know that you know i mean the miracle
was here before human beings came along

211
00:13:45,46 --> 00:13:47,18
and it'll be here after they've gone.

212
00:13:47,38 --> 00:13:51,20
The miracle was here before organic
life started there was a time

213
00:13:51,20 --> 00:13:55,32
when there was no organic life on the earth
there was just stardust you might say

214
00:13:55,32 --> 00:14:01,58
you know and it was itself into organic
life and into. Yes. And so that miracle.

215
00:14:01,69 --> 00:14:02,63
We can't touch that.

216
00:14:02,74 --> 00:14:06,86
So i'm not really ultimately i'm
not despairing because i know that

217
00:14:06,86 --> 00:14:09,70
that is totally secure and totally safe

218
00:14:09,70 --> 00:14:16,38
but i must say i love this organic life
i love this flesh and bones and blood

219
00:14:16,38 --> 00:14:18,91
and breath and air and i
love this consciousness

220
00:14:18,91 --> 00:14:24,90
and i'd be very very out of struggle
with all my might to protected

221
00:14:24,90 --> 00:14:27,64
and to keep it going and you know it's.

222
00:14:28,14 --> 00:14:32,87
I feel so enriched and overjoyed in
my life because of these realisations

223
00:14:32,87 --> 00:14:37,97
and i see the tremendous unhappiness in
you know the faces in the lives of most

224
00:14:37,97 --> 00:14:41,65
people and tremendous unhappiness
in their relationships

225
00:14:41,65 --> 00:14:44,60
and their their inability to love
each other or to love themselves

226
00:14:45,47 --> 00:14:48,75
that i just think people would be doing
themselves a favor to you know look at

227
00:14:48,75 --> 00:14:54,19
these things seriously. Can i get a
definition of the aquarius. Vision.

228
00:14:55,84 --> 00:14:57,43
Well the aquarius vision.

229
00:14:57,65 --> 00:15:03,74
I just think that it's
getting back to our roots.

230
00:15:04,58 --> 00:15:08,94
John said thanks very much greater than
thank you. Thank me. That was great.

231
00:15:09,21 --> 00:15:10,45
Ok this ok.
