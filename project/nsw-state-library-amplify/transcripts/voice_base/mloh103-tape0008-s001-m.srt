1
00:00:14,77 --> 00:00:21,10
We've spent hours doing a medley.

2
00:00:21,94 --> 00:00:25,85
Yeah.

3
00:00:25,87 --> 00:00:31,03
These days.

4
00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:37,49
My name is david hallett i i
was at university in 1973

5
00:00:37,49 --> 00:00:40,13
and it was the first term holidays

6
00:00:40,13 --> 00:00:42,76
and back then we had three terms
rather than foursome esther's

7
00:00:42,76 --> 00:00:47,30
and the friends in balmain in
the house i was sharing said.

8
00:00:47,32 --> 00:00:50,64
We're all going on the trying to
member tonight which i said where

9
00:00:51,90 --> 00:00:52,78
and it was part of.

10
00:00:54,22 --> 00:00:59,05
The a us which is the australian students
both in the university students had

11
00:00:59,06 --> 00:01:02,75
arranged a train called the good times
express which went from sydney.

12
00:01:02,98 --> 00:01:06,10
Sorry from melbourne. I think their
bus students they were from adelaide

13
00:01:06,91 --> 00:01:08,73
and the train went from
melbourne through sydney

14
00:01:08,73 --> 00:01:14,47
and took about seemingly five weeks to
get from sydney to to lose more than was

15
00:01:14,47 --> 00:01:16,78
stuck on buses. And tracked down to nimbin

16
00:01:17,59 --> 00:01:20,83
and it was about a thousand people who i'd
never heard of nimbin i had never even

17
00:01:20,83 --> 00:01:24,75
actually been out of sydney
much up to that point and

18
00:01:24,75 --> 00:01:26,82
that was my first real connection

19
00:01:26,82 --> 00:01:32,61
and it's very hard to use later to explain
the way to illustrate the impact of

20
00:01:32,62 --> 00:01:37,33
that festival and the crush of
the people and just the openness

21
00:01:37,33 --> 00:01:41,64
and spiritually just how wonderful
it was to all of us boys

22
00:01:41,64 --> 00:01:43,63
and girls who came from
the suburbs and the unis

23
00:01:44,79 --> 00:01:47,33
and then of course i went back
to uni after that as we all did

24
00:01:48,48 --> 00:01:50,06
and i came up at the end of

25
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:55,19
that year for a couple of weeks holiday
staying over at ucla which is just over the

26
00:01:55,19 --> 00:01:59,82
hill in the tweed valley and but those
couple of weeks seems to have turned nearly.

27
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:08,02
Two years now.

28
00:02:08,04 --> 00:02:08,73
Well

29
00:02:08,73 --> 00:02:12,81
that largely was because it was based
around the campsites of the people who you

30
00:02:12,81 --> 00:02:19,74
know formed in groups all
over the. The geography here.

31
00:02:20,71 --> 00:02:24,31
The festival was it was really
interesting because it was sort of like

32
00:02:24,31 --> 00:02:29,63
decentralization in there were camping
areas although over the geography here in

33
00:02:29,63 --> 00:02:31,26
basically people from their own.

34
00:02:31,90 --> 00:02:37,24
Many hamlets within that
within all of that and.

35
00:02:37,25 --> 00:02:40,54
It was unseasonably fine and dry

36
00:02:40,54 --> 00:02:43,64
and beautiful all through the
may every day was hot and fine

37
00:02:43,64 --> 00:02:45,93
and all the nights were. Were do you.

38
00:02:45,94 --> 00:02:46,08
We

39
00:02:46,08 --> 00:02:50,44
and clear except for the full moon night which
was actually a bit cloudy so for a change

40
00:02:50,44 --> 00:02:52,15
for the ground was dry

41
00:02:53,65 --> 00:02:56,67
but the town with a great big
focus for all of the things

42
00:02:56,67 --> 00:02:58,95
that were going on throughout the time.

43
00:02:59,07 --> 00:03:02,24
And i think just the fact of
the people sharing in it's own

44
00:03:03,23 --> 00:03:05,61
and everyone's company on
this large scale in a.

45
00:03:05,98 --> 00:03:11,47
In a sort of a disorganised way we're
also used to coming from organised events

46
00:03:11,47 --> 00:03:13,76
and sporting events and
social events and cities

47
00:03:13,76 --> 00:03:17,79
but this was very very different and it
was very much a make your own festival

48
00:03:18,87 --> 00:03:22,13
and for all of us had been to pop
festivals and sunbury even while laces

49
00:03:22,13 --> 00:03:24,98
and things it wasn't it
wasn't a rock star festival.

50
00:03:25,22 --> 00:03:28,76
They had the african south
african pianist dollar brand

51
00:03:30,33 --> 00:03:33,29
but it was very much an
unknown ego situation in

52
00:03:33,29 --> 00:03:39,19
that even he was sitting on a little six
inch high stage down in the field with a

53
00:03:39,19 --> 00:03:43,15
with an old piano on it and
the balls of bengal was there

54
00:03:43,15 --> 00:03:46,28
but they weren't you know.
They weren't actually d.c.

55
00:03:46,28 --> 00:03:48,22
or Ten years after woodstock or anything.

56
00:03:49,52 --> 00:03:55,14
It was very prominent there i think especially
with the religious groups all manner

57
00:03:55,15 --> 00:03:59,90
of seventies sri this and
other that. Who were.

58
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,22
No actually a good deal more organized than
many of us who are came over there were

59
00:04:04,22 --> 00:04:07,56
sort of open open eyes and open
hearts and open minds to things

60
00:04:08,45 --> 00:04:09,16
and they were sort of.

61
00:04:10,65 --> 00:04:15,59
But they within themselves had sort of a
theatrical exposition a musical exposition

62
00:04:15,59 --> 00:04:17,85
the singing and a performance thing that

63
00:04:17,85 --> 00:04:21,19
that i think strongly touched everyone
as these sort of small processions would

64
00:04:21,19 --> 00:04:26,59
come in into town after dark and go
into the hall and set up with candles

65
00:04:26,59 --> 00:04:27,49
and music and

66
00:04:28,57 --> 00:04:32,21
and sing their song of whichever
particular generally eastern leaning

67
00:04:32,21 --> 00:04:37,44
that these these religious
groups had and the theater. And.

68
00:04:39,33 --> 00:04:42,36
The acrobat of course who came in
town and before md every night

69
00:04:43,19 --> 00:04:44,26
but would be very hard to say.

70
00:04:45,40 --> 00:04:48,70
The nimbin festival was this
or that or these events happen

71
00:04:48,70 --> 00:04:51,93
or these people did specific things
because it wasn't like that at all.

72
00:04:52,04 --> 00:04:54,25
It was very much. This idea of a.

73
00:04:54,74 --> 00:05:01,32
Do it yourself festival it was like you
know the cross between between a boy scout

74
00:05:01,32 --> 00:05:01,80
camp and

75
00:05:02,62 --> 00:05:18,46
and being on l s d through
the both of them strangely.

76
00:05:20,65 --> 00:05:24,28
That. I think in nimbin.

77
00:05:24,96 --> 00:05:28,81
And i think everyone because i mean
it has to be admitted that during

78
00:05:28,81 --> 00:05:32,50
that time a lot of psilocybin
mushrooms were taken.

79
00:05:33,52 --> 00:05:38,57
And so the whole impact in you know
not just visually and all related

80
00:05:38,57 --> 00:05:42,04
but in sixth and seventh and eighth
sense as if you want to count

81
00:05:42,04 --> 00:05:46,22
that many was very very strong on
people but i think the fact was

82
00:05:46,22 --> 00:05:48,70
and i've always felt it
and you've got to say

83
00:05:48,70 --> 00:05:53,78
that nimbin even though i didn't
know the truth of it then nimbin.

84
00:05:53,79 --> 00:05:59,02
Is and was the graveyard of one of
the greatest forests of red cedar

85
00:05:59,02 --> 00:06:03,99
that was ever known. I mean it was called
the red sea and even when we came here

86
00:06:03,99 --> 00:06:07,28
and a lot of these things are
gone now but all of the hills

87
00:06:07,28 --> 00:06:10,06
and many of them as they
have gone had these.

88
00:06:10,08 --> 00:06:11,43
The ring the trees

89
00:06:11,43 --> 00:06:16,24
or the remains quite tall you know 50 100
feet high with you know the remains of

90
00:06:16,24 --> 00:06:18,96
what what limbs they had up the top

91
00:06:18,96 --> 00:06:23,12
and of course even being on mushrooms you
had this it did have this graveyard.

92
00:06:23,67 --> 00:06:24,44
Feeling

93
00:06:24,44 --> 00:06:28,57
and you could see a lot of erosion in
the hills around a lot of the slips

94
00:06:28,57 --> 00:06:29,73
and the slides falling.

95
00:06:31,10 --> 00:06:35,14
So even though you've got
the rim of the trees

96
00:06:35,14 --> 00:06:37,89
and the forested hills
around i mean it was obvious

97
00:06:37,89 --> 00:06:40,94
that this place had been had
been cleared out lock stock

98
00:06:40,94 --> 00:06:47,01
and barrel of all this cedar and it was
like it had been repealed with beef

99
00:06:47,01 --> 00:06:51,18
and dairy and bananas
and loggers and things

100
00:06:51,18 --> 00:06:55,00
but there was a very much something
missing from here and i've always felt

101
00:06:55,00 --> 00:06:56,75
that we're sort of here.

102
00:06:57,11 --> 00:07:01,08
After the event so to speak but
then again in the 20 years

103
00:07:01,08 --> 00:07:05,50
that i've been here many of these old ring
bark trees we were so apparent then are

104
00:07:05,50 --> 00:07:08,46
gone now been cleared or knocked out
because they were dam dangerous anyway.

105
00:07:09,50 --> 00:07:12,95
And of course in that time actually
because going back to the time

106
00:07:12,95 --> 00:07:13,67
when there were beef here

107
00:07:13,67 --> 00:07:16,61
and you could actually be fined
for having trees on properties

108
00:07:16,61 --> 00:07:20,53
when beef was the run of the day you
know too many trees you'd be fined

109
00:07:20,53 --> 00:07:25,25
and you wouldn't do well within the
industry because it was clear everything as

110
00:07:25,25 --> 00:07:28,71
many blades of grass for the cows
to eat was what it was all about.

111
00:07:28,85 --> 00:07:31,57
But that's changed a lot of a lot
of the beef has gone by the way now

112
00:07:31,57 --> 00:07:35,33
and there are many more trees have grown
back up in a lot of the people who have

113
00:07:35,33 --> 00:07:37,98
come in the intervening years of
course of planting a lot more.

114
00:07:39,17 --> 00:07:44,86
And so i think that's it's made the place
seem a lot a lot nicer now than it felt

115
00:07:44,86 --> 00:07:47,71
then because there was
this strange sort of rape.

116
00:07:47,74 --> 00:07:52,07
Id impression that i got from back then
much as i love being here and like.

117
00:07:52,33 --> 00:07:55,59
I love to be out in the hills and
i'd been a boy scout and a kid

118
00:07:55,59 --> 00:07:58,06
and all those things and i'd camped
a lot and gone out of the bush.

119
00:07:59,25 --> 00:08:02,44
But i hadn't been to the. Area
before and you know it has

120
00:08:02,44 --> 00:08:05,82
that stripped eroded thing

121
00:08:05,83 --> 00:08:09,15
that sort of was in a real state of
transition then because all the previous

122
00:08:09,15 --> 00:08:12,55
industries and the reason for
their being had sort of folded.

123
00:08:15,76 --> 00:08:22,02
Because. It used.

124
00:08:22,04 --> 00:08:25,49
Well i sort of came for a holiday
back at the end of that.

125
00:08:25,64 --> 00:08:29,74
I came to niman for a holiday the end of

126
00:08:29,74 --> 00:08:32,80
that university year in which
the aquarius festival was on

127
00:08:33,64 --> 00:08:38,34
and i just as the group i was with who
are a group of artists and musicians

128
00:08:38,34 --> 00:08:42,44
and sculptors we just suddenly realize

129
00:08:42,44 --> 00:08:47,90
that we were this household this mini
community with bales and areas and igloos

130
00:08:47,91 --> 00:08:49,04
and teepees

131
00:08:49,04 --> 00:08:55,08
and we just became as artistic it wasn't
a conscious decision really people were

132
00:08:55,08 --> 00:08:57,99
there for various reasons a couple had
their house full others were visitors

133
00:08:57,99 --> 00:09:01,32
and people coming in but we actually
spend most of the year together and

134
00:09:01,32 --> 00:09:01,78
that point

135
00:09:02,47 --> 00:09:07,21
and did a large exhibition in the sydney
gallery in the hogarth gallery through

136
00:09:07,21 --> 00:09:11,66
that year and started doing a lot
of performance and and music

137
00:09:11,66 --> 00:09:15,73
and i was a lifestyle i hadn't gone into
having been a good catholic boy in sydney

138
00:09:16,44 --> 00:09:19,47
and gone through university.

139
00:09:19,49 --> 00:09:23,10
This was just a whole new opening up
for me i started playing the piano

140
00:09:23,10 --> 00:09:27,07
when i was seven years old but most of
that was in a formal academic sense

141
00:09:27,07 --> 00:09:31,97
and i hadn't really got to a freer and
more expressive forms of music to really

142
00:09:31,98 --> 00:09:34,99
that the evening that i came
up here at the end of 1973

143
00:09:36,13 --> 00:09:38,38
and i haven't really looked back
from that point up in musician.

144
00:09:38,93 --> 00:09:41,44
And performer largely since then.

145
00:09:43,20 --> 00:09:48,17
How you treat your reputation.

146
00:09:49,12 --> 00:09:54,78
Here. I've been writing poetry
now for about 18 years.

147
00:09:56,39 --> 00:09:59,95
I think it was in the mid 70s
i went down to adelaide for.

148
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:00,48
The arts festival

149
00:10:00,48 --> 00:10:06,35
and i just was mixing with an old friend
richard tipping the adelaide based poet

150
00:10:07,19 --> 00:10:09,68
and i just got involved with all
the writers down there and.

151
00:10:10,05 --> 00:10:13,94
I started writing immediately when i left
there and through a lot of that time.

152
00:10:14,02 --> 00:10:18,19
Also i was working inland as quite a few
of the people from nimbin there was a long

153
00:10:18,19 --> 00:10:20,96
period where for about five six years.

154
00:10:20,98 --> 00:10:22,27
The number nights would go off

155
00:10:22,27 --> 00:10:25,86
and work the wheat harvest out
in the north west of the state.

156
00:10:25,88 --> 00:10:27,18
Strangely at

157
00:10:27,18 --> 00:10:31,98
that time because we were not from the area
which is why we originally got work out

158
00:10:31,98 --> 00:10:37,10
there because there were lots of problems
of potentials for corruption with people

159
00:10:37,10 --> 00:10:40,58
you know grading local farmers
highly because you live there

160
00:10:40,58 --> 00:10:43,65
and it was very hard not to do it if they
were mates the old mate your problem.

161
00:10:44,46 --> 00:10:47,50
And also which they found to be a good
benefit of the times a lot of the nimbin

162
00:10:47,50 --> 00:10:48,34
people didn't drink

163
00:10:49,08 --> 00:10:52,58
and once was stuck out on these railway
lines out in a leading middle of nowhere.

164
00:10:52,95 --> 00:10:57,11
Many of the itinerant workers that had in
the past took to the drink pretty rad.

165
00:10:57,18 --> 00:11:00,43
You know readily and radically
and there was a problem.

166
00:11:00,59 --> 00:11:03,53
The whole shipload of wheat was turned
back from china because it hadn't been

167
00:11:03,53 --> 00:11:08,57
properly tested and so the number nights.
You know 50 or 60 of them would go there.

168
00:11:08,58 --> 00:11:13,00
Each year to work but are also
with working to harvest in land

169
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:15,16
and fruit picking down on the murray

170
00:11:15,16 --> 00:11:18,15
and i just got into this whole
vernacular of writing about travels

171
00:11:18,15 --> 00:11:23,57
and working inland and then working
harvests and then getting back home

172
00:11:23,57 --> 00:11:26,52
and starting to write more and more about
nimbin and the changes and the people

173
00:11:26,52 --> 00:11:32,58
and just the colour of or lack of colour
of things happening here as well and.

174
00:11:32,60 --> 00:11:36,48
In the late seventies and early
eighties through the folk concerts

175
00:11:36,48 --> 00:11:40,52
and the variety concerts and the
classical music concerts and.

176
00:11:41,03 --> 00:11:46,84
Just the cafes a rainbow cafe and
other sorts of events small and large

177
00:11:46,84 --> 00:11:49,09
and festive events and annual shows.

178
00:11:49,32 --> 00:11:52,89
I just started performing more and
more the poetry that i was doing

179
00:11:52,89 --> 00:11:55,74
and also getting in league with two
or three other writers up here.

180
00:11:56,20 --> 00:11:59,94
Who were or weren't writing
about things local and.

181
00:12:00,59 --> 00:12:03,41
It just grew from that
point to the extent now

182
00:12:03,41 --> 00:12:08,15
that we have regular we have shows called
a grand piano in poetry concerts where

183
00:12:08,15 --> 00:12:10,86
we'll have six poets and six pianists

184
00:12:10,86 --> 00:12:15,41
but i also run poetry events
in lismore in byron bay

185
00:12:15,41 --> 00:12:18,63
and have a touring group as well
but a lot of that comes from.

186
00:12:19,89 --> 00:12:22,09
Just my own background i mean i'm.

187
00:12:22,10 --> 00:12:25,89
I did i did history at school i
did anthropology at university.

188
00:12:25,90 --> 00:12:30,89
So i sort of remain this the poet
anthropologist historian recording

189
00:12:30,89 --> 00:12:34,44
and colouring or trying to do
justice for the color of the things

190
00:12:34,44 --> 00:12:54,85
and the people around me here.

191
00:12:54,87 --> 00:12:57,62
Many people came here many artists

192
00:12:57,62 --> 00:13:02,21
and performers have come to
nimbin over the last two decades.

193
00:13:02,23 --> 00:13:05,13
You know for many of you know
sydney brisbane melbourne.

194
00:13:05,48 --> 00:13:08,35
The capital cities but as you see.

195
00:13:08,36 --> 00:13:13,66
Been a great diversity to them which i think
as a time was gone on this is this is

196
00:13:13,66 --> 00:13:16,29
being one of the magical
things about the place here.

197
00:13:16,48 --> 00:13:20,27
I think niman would have been very boring
if you had you know 2000 people all

198
00:13:20,27 --> 00:13:22,76
saying bob dylan and or cat
stevens and not much else

199
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:30,03
but i think the diversity of things
here is that. We are a rural community.

200
00:13:30,04 --> 00:13:33,98
Whatever else no might be it is that
isolated just by the geography of

201
00:13:33,98 --> 00:13:38,39
that it's you know 20 miles to
the nearest large town and that.

202
00:13:39,80 --> 00:13:40,51
As the musical

203
00:13:40,51 --> 00:13:44,17
and artistic community here people became
thrown together who in other situations

204
00:13:44,17 --> 00:13:46,56
in towns and cities wouldn't
have been put together.

205
00:13:47,12 --> 00:13:51,29
And that made the interesting
crossover of you know.

206
00:13:52,30 --> 00:13:58,50
Indian playing with western folkies and
celtic music playing with rock people

207
00:13:58,50 --> 00:14:04,91
and celtic news. Those playing with the
reggae and just i think the larger events.

208
00:14:04,92 --> 00:14:07,65
And things like the nimbin
all-stars and the nimh

209
00:14:07,65 --> 00:14:12,28
and folk club started rubbing a lot of
the shoulders off the edges between the

210
00:14:12,28 --> 00:14:14,68
various performers such that now.

211
00:14:15,91 --> 00:14:18,32
I mean the differences and the
bad chemistries are always there

212
00:14:18,32 --> 00:14:20,11
and they grow to with the good things

213
00:14:20,11 --> 00:14:24,26
but i think it's got to a situation where
across the board a lot of these museums

214
00:14:24,26 --> 00:14:27,68
and other people can work together
in situations you wouldn't imagine.

215
00:14:29,04 --> 00:14:32,71
And also in the artistic situation where
you can have for example we had a recent

216
00:14:32,71 --> 00:14:36,86
spring arts festival where there was a
lot of arts crafts furniture woodwork

217
00:14:36,86 --> 00:14:38,99
ceramics jewelry and things on display but

218
00:14:38,99 --> 00:14:41,62
that was way of an into
the performance of.

219
00:14:42,27 --> 00:14:48,75
Of ensembles baroque ensembles classical
ensembles jazz pianists poetry readings on

220
00:14:48,76 --> 00:14:51,05
guard dance groups. I mean to me.

221
00:14:51,08 --> 00:14:51,43
I mean

222
00:14:51,43 --> 00:14:56,43
and speaking as the president of the nimbin
school of arts incorporated which manages

223
00:14:56,43 --> 00:14:59,99
the hall. I think these are
the magic events the big ones

224
00:14:59,99 --> 00:15:04,89
that really have the attraction
for the public and the community

225
00:15:04,89 --> 00:15:07,10
but also for the performers as well

226
00:15:07,10 --> 00:15:12,59
and for the artists because they
do these things on a large scale.

227
00:15:12,71 --> 00:15:14,40
I like to do things on this sort of scale

228
00:15:14,40 --> 00:15:17,18
but i think it is just draws people
together on this bigger scale

229
00:15:18,25 --> 00:15:22,57
and it makes them also feel part larger
part of this of this larger artistic

230
00:15:22,57 --> 00:15:22,68
community

231
00:15:23,76 --> 00:15:26,58
and give them more respect i think in
a lot of ways for what they're doing

232
00:15:26,58 --> 00:15:30,25
and what others are doing because there is
a chip on the shoulder about nimbin as a

233
00:15:30,25 --> 00:15:35,13
lot of cliches that the media
readily fall into about and in and.

234
00:15:36,55 --> 00:15:38,68
I think it's very easy to carry

235
00:15:38,68 --> 00:15:43,35
that like a cloak around you as well
rather to see where one's own worth.

236
00:15:44,09 --> 00:15:47,01
I mean it's ludicrous to my mind to
pointed a village like an imminent so

237
00:15:47,01 --> 00:15:51,00
that places got a drug problem when
the whole world got a drug problem or

238
00:15:51,00 --> 00:15:52,95
that places got a problem with itinerants

239
00:15:52,95 --> 00:15:57,12
and unemployed people whereas it just seems
to be a bit of a haven to these people

240
00:15:57,12 --> 00:15:59,93
and where they are all over
the place from the coast in.

241
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:05,53
Land anyway just that the finger
gets pointed to in a bad way

242
00:16:05,53 --> 00:16:10,80
and i think the media is not helped a lot
of the artists to feel you know how they

243
00:16:10,80 --> 00:16:13,43
step out from that whereas
i go out to the outside.

244
00:16:13,66 --> 00:16:18,92
Well now and i'm a nimbin performance
poet and that's what i do and i find

245
00:16:18,92 --> 00:16:21,59
that there's a fascination i
go to sydney or melbourne

246
00:16:22,36 --> 00:16:25,28
and there's an absolute
fascination about nimbin

247
00:16:25,28 --> 00:16:28,86
and any anthropologist
who story in poet's.

248
00:16:28,90 --> 00:16:34,35
Words about and then i don't know what it
is it's like it's like the daytrippers.

249
00:16:34,37 --> 00:16:36,78
I mean newman's got a bad
reputation in many ways

250
00:16:37,66 --> 00:16:40,84
and yet during any holiday period.

251
00:16:40,85 --> 00:16:43,19
The volvo's in the commodores

252
00:16:43,19 --> 00:16:49,99
and the daytrippers with their world to do
white nylon reebok jacuzzi families come

253
00:16:49,99 --> 00:16:52,91
over here on mass every holiday period.

254
00:16:52,93 --> 00:16:56,59
I don't know what they are their
attraction is i can say why i come here.

255
00:16:56,87 --> 00:17:00,74
I don't know whether they're. They come for
a bit of a dare. I think in a bit of a.

256
00:17:01,08 --> 00:17:04,13
A bit of fun and it's a bit
shocking for some of them but.

257
00:17:04,55 --> 00:17:06,82
It's somewhere between shock
interior also do you.

258
00:17:07,63 --> 00:17:08,96
I mean is like cheaper
than going to calcutta

259
00:17:08,96 --> 00:17:12,71
or you if you're staying environment
you do a day trip to nimbin

260
00:17:12,71 --> 00:17:13,92
and go back home feeling.

261
00:17:14,02 --> 00:17:16,81
Rest assured in your mortgage in the
house back in sydney or melbourne

262
00:17:16,81 --> 00:17:21,12
that you've got. It's a strange thing
some people come here expecting the worst

263
00:17:21,12 --> 00:17:25,02
and a very glad it's here and other
people come here actually open minded and

264
00:17:25,84 --> 00:17:30,48
and think it's this wonderful sort of
smorgasbord pot pourri of things going on

265
00:17:30,48 --> 00:17:33,30
here.

266
00:17:33,32 --> 00:17:49,25
Everyone.

267
00:17:51,27 --> 00:17:52,81
Not all.

268
00:17:53,55 --> 00:17:56,42
Some people within nimbin
speak badly of nimbin

269
00:17:56,42 --> 00:17:59,50
and don't like the clichés
about it and some people.

270
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:02,45
Very defensive of their town
but i think most people

271
00:18:02,45 --> 00:18:05,70
when someone comes in is only been here
for 20 minutes and a cup of coffee and

272
00:18:05,70 --> 00:18:08,94
and bad mouth a place before they're
in their car happily driving away.

273
00:18:09,19 --> 00:18:11,10
I don't think anyone really likes that.

274
00:18:12,13 --> 00:18:17,93
But i think also we're a bit world weary
just with the necessity of the obvious bad

275
00:18:17,93 --> 00:18:22,46
front page headline which just paint
things in one ways one way because i think

276
00:18:22,46 --> 00:18:26,11
what's really got to be stressed is
that niman is a very complicated place.

277
00:18:26,95 --> 00:18:28,70
It's not a one dimensional place at all.

278
00:18:28,80 --> 00:18:32,69
It's a very complex place
and i really think the best

279
00:18:33,41 --> 00:18:37,04
and worst of people come here and the
best and worst of things happen here

280
00:18:37,04 --> 00:18:38,82
and it's almost the nature of it.

281
00:18:38,87 --> 00:18:43,33
There is a certain there is more than a
certain there's quite a degree of tolerance

282
00:18:44,42 --> 00:18:47,65
of other things but of course within
that this great deal of intolerance.

283
00:18:48,44 --> 00:18:52,59
But i think that's always been very
apparent here as a very diverse.

284
00:18:53,01 --> 00:18:58,11
Lot of people have come here just like
the waves of people have come here the

285
00:18:58,11 --> 00:19:01,91
original hippies the whole influx
of sort of new castle lights

286
00:19:01,91 --> 00:19:03,47
that came in the late 70s early 80s

287
00:19:03,47 --> 00:19:08,71
and the whole what you'd have to call sort
of yuppie established family four wheel

288
00:19:08,71 --> 00:19:11,45
drive people actually came here
with money and property and

289
00:19:11,45 --> 00:19:15,00
and plans even if all those plans
didn't match their expectations

290
00:19:16,09 --> 00:19:20,55
but there's been many stages of of changes
just like right now in one thousand

291
00:19:20,55 --> 00:19:24,88
ninety two going to 93 there's a great
deal of changes and development

292
00:19:24,88 --> 00:19:29,20
and expansion syringe systems
and recycling the garbage

293
00:19:29,20 --> 00:19:30,52
and rainbow power companies

294
00:19:30,52 --> 00:19:35,38
and permaculture developments the expectations
around how all these things will go

295
00:19:35,38 --> 00:19:36,64
i think it is a bit.

296
00:19:37,66 --> 00:19:41,27
I don't i think it's a big question mark
in many people's eyes about what's going

297
00:19:41,27 --> 00:19:41,70
to happen

298
00:19:42,71 --> 00:19:47,00
but then again i mean i look around these
these hills in this bowl shaped valley

299
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:47,68
where in here

300
00:19:47,68 --> 00:19:52,00
and i see this is going to be quite a city
here in 20 years time whether we like it

301
00:19:52,00 --> 00:19:56,99
or not just by crush of population alone
and by the attraction of the fact

302
00:19:56,99 --> 00:19:59,10
that people keep pouring in here.

303
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:03,51
Whether the yuppie daytrippers where people
looking to get out of the city looking

304
00:20:03,51 --> 00:20:09,25
for land whether there are the german
backpackers you know it just comes it comes

305
00:20:09,25 --> 00:20:15,67
and it comes all the time. As.

306
00:20:16,43 --> 00:20:20,63
A whole.

307
00:20:22,36 --> 00:20:26,73
You know. Oppression.

308
00:20:31,83 --> 00:20:34,77
In some ways there's a sense
we have to prove ourselves

309
00:20:34,78 --> 00:20:39,68
but of course there's an anarchistic
thing in nimbin than any prove anything.

310
00:20:40,07 --> 00:20:43,95
And the rest of the world is pretty stuffed
anyway so i mean they can't really come

311
00:20:43,95 --> 00:20:47,95
round pointing fingers here when everything
else is such a male's a mess elsewhere.

312
00:20:48,63 --> 00:20:53,72
But niman has been very very
sort of quintessential in.

313
00:20:53,74 --> 00:20:57,41
In the home builders in
in the forest actions

314
00:20:57,41 --> 00:21:01,91
and many other changes in home birthing
lots of things that actually stem from

315
00:21:01,91 --> 00:21:05,84
that that have had influences and some
ways a large influence in other areas.

316
00:21:06,08 --> 00:21:06,89
Apart from here.

317
00:21:07,80 --> 00:21:11,56
But even the new permaculture developments
if they come out anything like the ideal.

318
00:21:12,43 --> 00:21:14,73
These are really important aspects that

319
00:21:14,73 --> 00:21:23,49
that have a larger effect
on australian culture.

320
00:21:26,23 --> 00:21:27,85
Nimbin audiences.

321
00:21:27,87 --> 00:21:31,83
Can be very very tough audiences
especially for the fact

322
00:21:31,83 --> 00:21:38,76
that so many people have performed here.
And so many groups from. You know.

323
00:21:38,78 --> 00:21:43,91
Hippy trippy cosmic religious people
finned horn people slim dusty

324
00:21:46,05 --> 00:21:51,40
all sorts of people have come here. Dance
groups overseas groups theatre groups.

325
00:21:51,48 --> 00:21:56,12
One man shows a lot of people i think
it's a bit of a testing ground for many

326
00:21:56,12 --> 00:21:59,82
performers and theatre
groups and musa's who.

327
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:02,87
On two going up the eastern
coast or heading for brisbane

328
00:22:02,87 --> 00:22:05,30
or festivals in queensland or whatever
and they think i'm an immigrant.

329
00:22:05,47 --> 00:22:06,81
Well we can always do a show in nimbin

330
00:22:07,73 --> 00:22:10,51
but newman's they had you know
there's an attitude in them

331
00:22:10,51 --> 00:22:14,26
and you know been there
seen that done that and.

332
00:22:14,28 --> 00:22:15,54
I mean you've got to promote things

333
00:22:15,54 --> 00:22:18,72
or really hook into things to attract people
to things because so much does happen

334
00:22:18,72 --> 00:22:21,02
here and the moon is a bit world weary

335
00:22:21,02 --> 00:22:23,92
and of course the recession is
biting as deep here as anywhere else

336
00:22:23,92 --> 00:22:28,75
and there are a lot of there are a lot of
poor people living in this area much as

337
00:22:28,75 --> 00:22:29,27
they'd like to be

338
00:22:29,27 --> 00:22:33,54
and a time many of them can't afford to
get a car going to get to the end of time

339
00:22:33,54 --> 00:22:39,56
and let alone to pay to get in the door.

340
00:22:42,51 --> 00:22:44,54
All right.

341
00:22:47,36 --> 00:22:49,78
This first time i wrote
in the summer of 1977

342
00:22:51,00 --> 00:22:54,60
and it's called always abounds about
nimbin this is called the holy

343
00:22:54,60 --> 00:22:57,62
and the oldie and oily town.

344
00:22:59,72 --> 00:23:01,06
We are but praise

345
00:23:01,77 --> 00:23:08,23
and line said stephen of the famous found
to know right of reply save each day's

346
00:23:08,23 --> 00:23:10,22
words or love

347
00:23:10,22 --> 00:23:16,78
or lack of along this line from muesli
gumboots to house cows for slaughter

348
00:23:18,37 --> 00:23:24,47
intense we reshuffle the deck of choice
and chance rather ruled by meetings

349
00:23:24,47 --> 00:23:31,16
and encounter then would we trust
leaders for no one could be

350
00:23:31,16 --> 00:23:37,26
everyone. Thus stalking simplicity
through complexity count.

351
00:23:37,66 --> 00:23:42,43
Just count. Contrary to contrary for ever.

352
00:23:42,45 --> 00:23:49,43
Diverse our ways we sprout spontaneous
versus structure survival versus creativity

353
00:23:50,25 --> 00:23:57,11
alone versus children and what point
of balance twixt all this. Never.

354
00:23:57,12 --> 00:23:59,69
Still for long enough shades of.

355
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:05,56
Everything rainbow and though the xt
you rush this town along the way side.

356
00:24:07,08 --> 00:24:13,88
The real estate sign reads fast food fast
country so often blind to the song of the

357
00:24:13,88 --> 00:24:17,71
slow creeks and rivers of
moonwalking the night sky

358
00:24:18,78 --> 00:24:23,73
and bury these invaders to the
land away just like the others

359
00:24:24,68 --> 00:24:27,34
and black man gone and forest gone

360
00:24:28,29 --> 00:24:32,27
and hills slide away
wrinkled fold and fall

361
00:24:32,27 --> 00:24:35,20
and the valley sings of pieces torn away.

362
00:24:35,53 --> 00:24:42,25
We invade a next of course we are invaded

363
00:24:43,61 --> 00:24:50,34
by technology man ploughs the
time we invade ourselves we

364
00:24:50,35 --> 00:24:51,17
invade ourselves

365
00:24:53,00 --> 00:24:58,47
but old settlers eyes trace only the figures
ever walking the one street so many

366
00:24:58,47 --> 00:25:03,99
drifters and babes in arms and
barefoot the colors and the clothes

367
00:25:03,99 --> 00:25:08,24
and the crazies wrapped in
blankets and mud deficiencies

368
00:25:09,04 --> 00:25:11,23
and dreams of guitar blues

369
00:25:12,15 --> 00:25:16,15
or heroine do use the
past of the old shadows

370
00:25:17,44 --> 00:25:24,09
and which way shall we be in
this painted new mythological

371
00:25:24,10 --> 00:25:29,23
town. And so many yet to
come from womb or wheels

372
00:25:30,24 --> 00:25:33,96
or wondering why open or closed.

373
00:25:35,31 --> 00:25:39,71
Which way shall we be
wanting to be fair and fine

374
00:25:39,71 --> 00:25:44,92
and friendly yet not flooded
by the highway flow.

375
00:25:44,93 --> 00:25:50,56
And peace in the valley and
peace at home to blend and be

376
00:25:50,56 --> 00:25:53,87
and feel freedom not to anarchy.

377
00:25:55,32 --> 00:25:59,93
Trying this lost notion of
primitive touch of trying.

378
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:00,15
Just

379
00:26:01,13 --> 00:26:10,05
and trials of community.

380
00:26:10,94 --> 00:26:17,16
1985 fly day night at a rainbow's been

381
00:26:18,78 --> 00:26:24,63
the one rule in the town is right
through rule the moral is let it slide

382
00:26:26,11 --> 00:26:31,54
from pub to rainbow caf across the village
street the bandaged hand stirring tea

383
00:26:31,54 --> 00:26:38,08
with the serene. And stage the only
safe place and stage type tonight.

384
00:26:38,58 --> 00:26:45,30
The defrocked swami's glory
ims his drunk dance raging

385
00:26:45,30 --> 00:26:46,66
fall out on the floor

386
00:26:46,66 --> 00:26:53,17
and looking up from the world of his to
the crazy eyes he flies on the hundred

387
00:26:53,17 --> 00:26:57,09
other eyes in the room and the
rush of the show into overload

388
00:26:58,30 --> 00:27:02,95
and then the two man dies
unwashed for a week on the sly.

389
00:27:04,43 --> 00:27:10,14
And non-game to even hold his
eyes to ask is name so alone

390
00:27:10,14 --> 00:27:14,45
and so much pain for a word or contact

391
00:27:14,45 --> 00:27:18,03
or company again melting into the corners.

392
00:27:19,48 --> 00:27:24,40
And the night rocks on and wrecks
the benjamin to fast and slow

393
00:27:24,40 --> 00:27:28,23
but holds the feel of
friends and fights tonight.

394
00:27:29,77 --> 00:27:32,77
And the night rocks on to the
midnight hour out the door

395
00:27:32,77 --> 00:27:38,00
and down the hill into the borrowed
veranda bed looms still pumping

396
00:27:38,00 --> 00:27:41,92
and mind counting on the drums.

397
00:27:42,71 --> 00:27:48,53
Shifting sleepless across the nimbin
night. The town rooster crows on the hour.

398
00:27:48,67 --> 00:27:55,44
And farm cocks chorus up the valley till
sunrise sweat come streaming through the

399
00:27:55,44 --> 00:27:58,94
sheets. And the village stays
back with another face.

400
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:02,73
For every day with mother wit

401
00:28:02,73 --> 00:28:07,52
and mother child father
free drifters drew forth.

402
00:28:08,68 --> 00:28:13,00
And the fallen people planted
like we saw in the park

403
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:16,80
and the high days out of town

404
00:28:16,80 --> 00:28:23,43
and so easy over the miles back
to the house above the sea into

405
00:28:23,43 --> 00:28:24,51
sanctuary.

406
00:28:25,10 --> 00:28:31,16
And slowly.

407
00:28:33,30 --> 00:28:37,33
A potted history of a day
in the life of nimbin

408
00:28:39,36 --> 00:28:45,02
and it came to pass on the eighth moon
of the seventy second year of the 20th

409
00:28:45,02 --> 00:28:50,32
century of the most published god
that the conservative government

410
00:28:51,51 --> 00:28:53,58
that would not conserve. Fail

411
00:28:54,91 --> 00:28:58,48
and the house of god of
did rule the land of milk

412
00:28:58,48 --> 00:29:00,86
and we in sheep did

413
00:29:01,93 --> 00:29:04,97
and they did give the
name yet to the v8 war

414
00:29:06,11 --> 00:29:08,99
and they did fly home on wings of petrol.

415
00:29:09,63 --> 00:29:13,33
They traveled sons from the
jungles of blood and fear

416
00:29:13,33 --> 00:29:19,04
and herbicides back to the beer
and bosom of their suburbs

417
00:29:20,16 --> 00:29:24,43
but for many the bosom had withered
on the credit card of desire

418
00:29:24,43 --> 00:29:30,24
and the cake of ambition and career
tasted of toxin and carcinogen

419
00:29:30,24 --> 00:29:36,83
and boredom of a sudden did flow
from the river of the aquarian jug

420
00:29:36,83 --> 00:29:40,71
scouts and ambassadors of dunster men alan

421
00:29:40,71 --> 00:29:45,84
and peter stuyvesant who did come upon
the village of nimbin in the valley of

422
00:29:45,84 --> 00:29:51,05
mulligan in the dark age of shattered
trees and slaughtered beef

423
00:29:51,05 --> 00:29:56,13
and banana spray and
in breda feudal lords.

424
00:29:56,15 --> 00:29:59,95
And the scouts did call and
trumpet through the land.

425
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:07,18
And of this company of rainbow
power of this one alternative way.

426
00:30:07,20 --> 00:30:11,62
That coursed and curl their clans
from the towns and the cities smoke

427
00:30:12,79 --> 00:30:15,53
and those are picked up
on the sacred mushroomed

428
00:30:15,53 --> 00:30:22,34
and slept face first in the done it was
a band of gypsies playing in the rain

429
00:30:22,34 --> 00:30:28,34
and they gave the seed and to each other
and they filed the government papers

430
00:30:29,14 --> 00:30:33,71
and they moved in cars and
vans and sandals and barefoot

431
00:30:33,71 --> 00:30:38,17
and bare breasted upon the
land. Some came running.

432
00:30:38,85 --> 00:30:44,27
Gladly who madly been
changing names and colors

433
00:30:44,27 --> 00:30:47,85
and gods changing the guards.

434
00:30:48,54 --> 00:30:51,99
Into grass castle kings
and herbals flings.

435
00:30:53,37 --> 00:30:58,29
And a free flight of raining
forest dense of market days.

436
00:30:58,86 --> 00:31:04,94
Of flood and fire and for
us. The cascade of sleep.

437
00:31:05,00 --> 00:31:10,79
The breasting of babies over
the hills of the far away tree

438
00:31:12,24 --> 00:31:17,81
and in the time they turned to find the
tweezers to tug at the tick from the tip of

439
00:31:17,81 --> 00:31:21,87
their dick. They had children
and children's children

440
00:31:21,87 --> 00:31:25,16
that grew a coat of many colors about them

441
00:31:26,05 --> 00:31:31,84
that waxed in the old wave of
their waning aquarium waters

442
00:31:32,74 --> 00:31:34,38
that washed and fed the.
