1
00:00:11,24 --> 00:00:21,88
To was via a W deliver than it was her who had a stroke at the moment, Alec Graaff under.

2
00:00:21,88 --> 00:00:28,52
I was put to work with valid under for some considerable trial:

3
00:00:28,52 --> 00:00:37,51
set for some months renewable work together are a number of October and learn nineteen twenty seven

4
00:00:37,74 --> 00:00:46,59
and are not allocated over argument refer your form and no:

5
00:00:46,59 --> 00:00:54,19
buses after five o'clock one night in the performance of the relic your site under Alec with large accounts

6
00:00:54,19 --> 00:01:02,32
( after five o'clock under anyway, he was soaked and it didn't start work the next morning

7
00:01:03,33 --> 00:01:08,00
and movement being a friend of a valid under.

8
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:19,05
I decided that perhaps someone should be done about it under this I canvassed thirty two train drivers of dollars find

9
00:01:19,05 --> 00:01:24,47
and other people train drivers, particularly because they are in a key position

10
00:01:25,33 --> 00:01:32,92
and also contacted the secretary of the O W and Queen Victoria building, Sydney,

11
00:01:32,92 --> 00:01:40,86
under during the regular during the following rate are the secretary came down to the site of four hundred kilometres

12
00:01:40,86 --> 00:01:42,66
section was years the supervision.

13
00:01:42,66 --> 00:01:51,66
I am was George Brodkin under other very helpful character are might say, however, he came down

14
00:01:51,66 --> 00:01:56,09
and requests to other people to other workers in my cell,

15
00:01:56,09 --> 00:02:05,62
accompanied by Mister broken we interviewed the Mister James Nero and Mister Alfred Martin and media,

16
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:06,99
Mister Martin of course vision.

17
00:02:06,99 --> 00:02:15,11
I was the second in command operations under we put it to Mister or under

18
00:02:15,6 --> 00:02:31,67
and Mister Martin that justice had been done under transfer grace reinstatement under after some mark the argument

19
00:02:31,67 --> 00:02:43,36
under central though her Mister Boddington under Australia three of us rushed to withdraw from the room while Mister

20
00:02:43,78 --> 00:02:53,00
Mister Martin conferred are after little pain at intervals of time we were called back into this room under Mister

21
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:57,18
Martin said that they had the boom him

22
00:02:57,18 --> 00:03:05,76
and Mister Muir had agreed to reinstate grey on the conditions that he didn't try to tell the foreman as John what to

23
00:03:05,76 --> 00:03:08,01
do so.

24
00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:09,47
I was very pleased her

25
00:03:09,47 --> 00:03:19,9
when this happened because the though growing that would have been victimised it hadn't been stood down the lost his

26
00:03:19,9 --> 00:03:21,19
job.

27
00:03:21,19 --> 00:03:33,07
He was a good militant unionist under our window that of the terms of the earth of that water is said to slipped her

28
00:03:33,4 --> 00:03:42,33
red after undertake to impress on grave at who couldn't open his mouth too far under the agreed to do that right away.

29
00:03:42,33 --> 00:03:50,72
Of course, and this of course was only eight are identified by the management because from my knowledge

30
00:03:50,72 --> 00:03:51,57
and observation.

31
00:03:51,57 --> 00:03:58,93
No great number tried to tell a form and what to do under the foreman was really trying to get rid of growth

32
00:03:58,93 --> 00:04:02,24
and however this is successful.

33
00:04:02,24 --> 00:04:12,48
It should return under four after the cruellest coronae were referring friends that any diseased to know he

34
00:04:12,48 --> 00:04:22,66
demonstrated a very long as a growth to get him out of the end of marketing, media, he didn't matter of fact to Europe,

35
00:04:22,66 --> 00:04:29,7
who resigned the was told to go return of emulsions. Side along with other than others.

36
00:04:29,7 --> 00:04:38,24
I was under introductory attitude that if he went to work must find few might be putting some other person out of out

37
00:04:38,24 --> 00:04:47,47
of work in the results of a man that he resigned rather than the workmanship.

38
00:04:47,47 --> 00:04:55,75
So what turned what John was he doing internal on the doors once a coherent concrete sound opposite view is that is

39
00:04:55,75 --> 00:05:07,63
another person to a third one at that time are soon choke on Joe Moses and he used to say to me at that time,

40
00:05:07,63 --> 00:05:14,53
Mister Bill microchips coming in most fishermen from down under via French broke

41
00:05:14,53 --> 00:05:22,65
and bringing van migrants from the Mediterranean under a numbered USA wants to media

42
00:05:22,84 --> 00:05:31,71
and are likely back to the old Ati hits a across the same time on indictment folding her and wonder our centre.

43
00:05:31,71 --> 00:05:36,25
Remember the old barge so in essence earlier,

44
00:05:36,25 --> 00:05:47,73
but the lower the older you are converted about thirty in the lavender when

45
00:05:47,74 --> 00:06:00,55
when the win you over the limit your delegate then left in yes over the letters written delegate under remark on radio:

46
00:06:00,55 --> 00:06:09,1
the job for some time where we had no representation as a union on Linda was one-sided of the

47
00:06:09,86 --> 00:06:19,41
but the room were the one man to get the job under that he was looked upon as well buy media numerators are

48
00:06:19,41 --> 00:06:28,03
unanswerable person who is a component with its objective of one whose name was decided on one of the Melbourne are I

49
00:06:28,03 --> 00:06:33,00
will leave you one on the Scotland by far. I know here.

50
00:06:33,00 --> 00:06:41,96
The area of the management under the micro converter that wasn't good for the unit for an under butter

51
00:06:41,96 --> 00:06:53,83
and he was keen to get them that the job that actually unit yes eventually I was selected by her role in the story you

52
00:06:53,83 --> 00:07:00,11
are so you may not believe this must turn the ropes revealed Doctor Richard Richard to

53
00:07:00,7 --> 00:07:13,53
but the story is that to Mister Muir, whom I came in contact with rumoured after I was elected union representative,

54
00:07:13,53 --> 00:07:23,31
Mister now so that one time on the Scone this information came through to perform an reader Jim Campbell,

55
00:07:23,31 --> 00:07:30,5
who was killed over a juvenile surely value in a friendly

56
00:07:30,96 --> 00:07:38,61
and to address as I so Jim had Mister Muir is our true under to Mister current,

57
00:07:38,61 --> 00:07:50,05
exchange under who told me this from a" M. Mister Merrill 's words through the camel will set.

58
00:07:50,05 --> 00:08:00,07
I don't know either don't select a try of the delegate the of the long-range nourished nuts,

59
00:08:00,07 --> 00:08:05,1
fruit Jim Campbell was Mister Muir 's words and I thought to myself, well,

60
00:08:05,1 --> 00:08:19,78
but I have by should prepare yourself for the the personal unit value under the nineteen under over to let under.

61
00:08:19,78 --> 00:08:23,18
I was live among reveal nineteen twenty nine

62
00:08:23,18 --> 00:08:32,07
and are posted here along one of the union delegates from the determination of the value are one of the two you are not

63
00:08:32,07 --> 00:08:40,78
alone on the other sideâ€“ so who was alone outside Rula run on the other side was no structural Malone Jock Macmillan

64
00:08:41,45 --> 00:08:51,81
and at the owner rather versatile chap who were here whose job and would go along with the document in error,

65
00:08:51,81 --> 00:08:53,24
one of the best document,

66
00:08:53,24 --> 00:09:03,03
one hundred wished to make your place to load within a few inches drive drunk he was right on target all the time

67
00:09:04,01 --> 00:09:09,25
and under development on the on the pylons when they weighed heavily on the road.

68
00:09:09,25 --> 00:09:19,00
It and no chocolate Melinda are here, it was a versatile chirp could play the piano and meals and entertainment

69
00:09:19,81 --> 00:09:28,65
and are a really fine person as I found out about the runner-up nineteen thirty one,

70
00:09:28,65 --> 00:09:37,99
just before I was married chocolate mode under he was presented with a Coffey said by the workers there are sought

71
00:09:37,99 --> 00:09:51,02
Coffey said in the answer unfortunately relevant nineteen thirty three twenty four Jock had secured work New Guinea

72
00:09:51,02 --> 00:09:55,57
with the below logo of dredging company under.

73
00:09:55,57 --> 00:10:04,51
I remember going out was greater seem from the advance look liner meant very under he went up to New Guinea first spell

74
00:10:04,51 --> 00:10:06,00
came back.

75
00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:07,12
Return to New Guinea

76
00:10:07,12 --> 00:10:16,66
and unfortunately crossing over fell out of the fellow the flying fox corrosion was German body was never recovered

77
00:10:17,85 --> 00:10:27,36
and seems the delicate right now another sign that was the eleventh Salvation Army delivered to the new role.

78
00:10:27,36 --> 00:10:33,57
This was just before a jock Macmillan Russo was burnt appointed delegate

79
00:10:33,67 --> 00:10:44,09
and we have another delegate over a term of Nelson 's foreign return your a very efficient running under emphysema

80
00:10:44,09 --> 00:11:01,95
travel out of the job to myself herself room after very whose job E and J was was appointed a conservative Mercer,

81
00:11:01,95 --> 00:11:12,3
so he would no you would nervously, who was working the size of the rooms is to look records needed in that area.

82
00:11:12,3 --> 00:11:15,31
In June this year.

83
00:11:15,31 --> 00:11:20,13
However, the borrower sector have known from the front of us,

84
00:11:20,13 --> 00:11:29,28
along with the four hundred Sri Lanka even do something about them, make sure they get photocopied something seven.

85
00:11:29,28 --> 00:11:40,5
Letter to the others are lasted for several unofficial program that will attempt at humour who have a look at the

86
00:11:40,5 --> 00:11:52,42
number of what one of the well home kit can you remember as far as the unit concerned whether the presses the rig is

87
00:11:52,42 --> 00:11:57,47
working on the islands, with a little of our own workers are willing natively as well.

88
00:11:57,47 --> 00:12:05,18
The rate is on the pilot were Cameron borrowed and what about term direction will for instance, was a marriage

89
00:12:05,18 --> 00:12:17,2
and are delivered from an reader the union didn't include Jim or her ( drivers will learn what is in their fear of,

90
00:12:17,2 --> 00:12:25,18
if EDF are those of visited her father lives of the grandfather still surviving it.

91
00:12:25,18 --> 00:12:30,65
He would know or alive of Marilyn Forum on higher permanent

92
00:12:30,65 --> 00:12:38,34
and none that I love the matter would be now servicing the one our most of the refund for inside seven

93
00:12:38,34 --> 00:12:49,88
when he can be with my riding in nineteen thirty one, who he died in nineteen thirty nine.

94
00:12:49,88 --> 00:12:58,52
So during Wylie were delegates are many of the many battles you have with the management are now the only bottle.

95
00:12:58,52 --> 00:13:02,62
I hope the Richard was the run

96
00:13:02,62 --> 00:13:14,69
when we were secured the reinstatement of the hourly industry fully won't only that he was selling it was at home so I

97
00:13:14,69 --> 00:13:15,19
see it.

98
00:13:15,19 --> 00:13:16,46
However, these you didn't only

99
00:13:16,46 --> 00:13:25,14
but while you were never have two together suggested having turned into the management term of the executive roller

100
00:13:25,55 --> 00:13:33,37
Richard Romario Rotorua rubella eleven nineteen twenty nine iron home

101
00:13:33,38 --> 00:13:44,09
and discovered the term of the Australia over review of members were concerned we were out on our out on our own have

102
00:13:44,09 --> 00:13:45,7
to run along together,

103
00:13:45,7 --> 00:13:52,57
nothing really wanted ourselves as only one union because the rewrite affiliated with the New South Wales trades

104
00:13:52,57 --> 00:13:54,00
and labour Council.

105
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:58,48
If we hadn't been in the media room Republic would have done much better for ourselves

106
00:13:58,74 --> 00:14:04,12
and are there any year 's had a hernia anything was done.

107
00:14:04,12 --> 00:14:11,24
No, I have to through a personal relationship with train drivers who will listen

108
00:14:11,24 --> 00:14:21,78
or the radio at double zero urinary industrial support real without OIC so you acted with that in congestion with a

109
00:14:21,78 --> 00:14:22,47
train drivers

110
00:14:22,47 --> 00:14:28,28
and not sound like shortages of twenty one years earlier with what can you remember a particular battle on this loan

111
00:14:28,28 --> 00:14:40,03
apart from the reinstatement of the view delegate ruler are one of Kosovo have under our online insurer to regional

112
00:14:40,07 --> 00:14:41,78
Mister Rich River

113
00:14:42,06 --> 00:14:51,49
and the business concerned over the skip of contract with conclude under the former home at the front row properly

114
00:14:51,49 --> 00:15:03,3
individual Willis under grave Moses O Rotorua, best day hunger or have been so from any time after problem,

115
00:15:03,3 --> 00:15:11,88
you should have been going to have a large via the concrete, remove her thunder with expected to accurate

116
00:15:11,88 --> 00:15:20,29
and that I will have a packing of under this day I said to the other terrace of the disaster problems like under strict

117
00:15:20,29 --> 00:15:31,68
level of statement of this letter are the discern, but with concrete# are reluctant to aim at AMD area under

118
00:15:31,68 --> 00:15:38,44
when down to to lunch under afterwards cause and lunch is finished

119
00:15:38,44 --> 00:15:47,1
and the scholar of an open about this from Mister Sinclair in the form under remembered for

120
00:15:47,1 --> 00:15:56,97
and saying our this adapt conference rose five crude under the earlier about performance of Marius is not grow five

121
00:15:56,97 --> 00:16:05,94
prints were seven three under so anyway, the editor of the percent disagreement and numbered only)

122
00:16:05,94 --> 00:16:15,37
you will have one of them was that the failure after that the reversed the December third through into Fermilab lunch

123
00:16:15,37 --> 00:16:24,47
clear the last scripted came up with an RML can control some of the quantum patrolman no further argument that it is it

124
00:16:24,47 --> 00:16:30,16
when I was in checking off how much concrete was actually use altogether is

125
00:16:30,47 --> 00:16:37,91
and you previously earn mentioned that there was two cubic ghastly using one Kevin Gardner 's machines,

126
00:16:37,91 --> 00:16:46,08
and that was to give the Gaza Strip form and right now.

127
00:16:46,08 --> 00:16:48,82
I worked that back in the power,

128
00:16:48,82 --> 00:16:57,9
how are often that meant the skip would come because the average return fairly low than one every twenty minutes all

129
00:16:58,23 --> 00:17:11,14
what was the sort of greater worth health dispute, to debate to giving out to get a concrete will,

130
00:17:11,14 --> 00:17:18,52
I would think that for Zambia team of them was that there was that the record is telling the story of the record day

131
00:17:18,52 --> 00:17:25,44
when the limits of about three hundred though there was no three hundred batches batches of a company rout term is a

132
00:17:25,44 --> 00:17:25,78
hundred

133
00:17:25,78 --> 00:17:38,58
and fifty skips not three hundred three hundred batches of concrete as was one giving out of a bachelor once it

134
00:17:38,58 --> 00:17:45,35
or are you talking about three hundred steps visitors to just two movements is a concrete Jewish risk.

135
00:17:45,35 --> 00:17:54,57
It wasn't in particular time was under fifty seventy five are right a hundred

136
00:17:54,57 --> 00:17:58,08
and fifty rights of the three hundred batches of concrete and a hundred

137
00:17:58,08 --> 00:18:07,38
and fifty 's sketch that right that TiVo remains at how often skip cannot give you to be packed generally speaking,

138
00:18:07,38 --> 00:18:18,06
will follow outside your own or the rest of the average is twenty minutes.

139
00:18:18,06 --> 00:18:28,43
If you take five years with a I worked in that it certainly SOR will then allow you on the perimeter of the video

140
00:18:28,43 --> 00:18:36,8
senders are that the solicitor averaging twenty minutes every twenty minutes provide you with constant is that the

141
00:18:36,8 --> 00:18:41,72
violent public works term under the relatives is a completely different system.

142
00:18:41,72 --> 00:18:47,95
The rail essence is to have the gigantic machines all they used to meet soon credible quantities

143
00:18:47,95 --> 00:18:53,88
and one in one one hit this living machines to mention, of course,

144
00:18:53,88 --> 00:18:56,97
though they attacked that the problem are completely different way

145
00:18:56,97 --> 00:18:59,77
and on the approaches letters of the different weather have a small machine.

146
00:18:59,77 --> 00:19:05,82
About ten of them rowing together because what the problem was the your job was.

147
00:19:05,82 --> 00:19:09,13
It was a steady solution there it went on for the five years,

148
00:19:09,13 --> 00:19:14,96
whereas that's the way gone long for the plaintiff of the Soweto to go up,

149
00:19:14,96 --> 00:19:21,38
but there is the approaches on the other hand, that they were always short of money to the toilet get ( in years,

150
00:19:21,38 --> 00:19:23,22
and they have to go like crazy try

151
00:19:23,22 --> 00:19:30,47
and catch up in the two together approaches to mean the friendship about it wouldn't got done had not been using the

152
00:19:30,47 --> 00:19:38,37
unemployment relief funds for them to get people I worked rationing on the Island Bridge Avenue, and on the other side.

153
00:19:38,37 --> 00:19:45,89
Looking at the methods they used they used to make matters with gigantic machines mixing large quantities at a time,

154
00:19:45,89 --> 00:19:51,71
our level using concrete guns of soft things with aporia so overspray up into tunnels

155
00:19:52,25 --> 00:19:58,61
and in some places they could drill a hole in the top four it down a hole into the other places they couldn't do

156
00:19:58,61 --> 00:20:08,28
without meter greater government chooses to monitor was your ( made by hand, says incredible.

157
00:20:08,28 --> 00:20:17,73
However, the sixth of the country who will deliver rivers from the front of the learner.

158
00:20:17,73 --> 00:20:28,3
Further about this might him to her about twenty and he came to the what does that have to do

159
00:20:28,3 --> 00:20:31,72
