1
00:00:10,60 --> 00:00:16,64
I like this not elude i was
very interested in the fact

2
00:00:16,64 --> 00:00:22,53
that i wanted equality equality and
parenting and shared parenting and all

3
00:00:22,53 --> 00:00:24,20
that we had a commitment
to that those notions.

4
00:00:24,50 --> 00:00:27,20
I found that with young children
that wasn't necessarily the case

5
00:00:28,76 --> 00:00:33,70
and there was a sad sort of
thinking back to the notion of it

6
00:00:33,70 --> 00:00:36,94
that the mother would look
after the children and that

7
00:00:37,89 --> 00:00:41,83
that you know men would go out
and be active in the world

8
00:00:42,92 --> 00:00:47,38
and so it's very building my own house was
a really interesting consummate to start

9
00:00:47,38 --> 00:00:50,23
negotiating that i was going on to
say look i don't want to anyway.

10
00:00:50,36 --> 00:00:56,06
Undermine the importance and the
joy of nurturing young children.

11
00:00:56,84 --> 00:00:59,89
It wasn't in any way for me a
need to move away from sally

12
00:00:59,89 --> 00:01:03,05
and join a bit more to
play my rights to equality

13
00:01:03,92 --> 00:01:08,12
and to encourage others to
particularly challenging

14
00:01:08,12 --> 00:01:11,76
that to participate in equal parenting.

15
00:01:11,78 --> 00:01:13,43
And you know i think

16
00:01:13,43 --> 00:01:16,59
that that's a whole other dialogue the
importance of nurturance of young children

17
00:01:16,59 --> 00:01:18,93
and you know i think the longer

18
00:01:18,93 --> 00:01:23,82
that they really truly nurtured kept
away from institutions like school.

19
00:01:24,71 --> 00:01:28,74
Anyway building the house. So i
decided to build a house so i did.

20
00:01:28,87 --> 00:01:31,52
And i got tremendous support
from my extended family.

21
00:01:32,78 --> 00:01:33,77
I had virtually no money

22
00:01:34,68 --> 00:01:40,59
and well i got tremendous
support for my extended family

23
00:01:40,59 --> 00:01:43,75
and great support from sally and
joan oh yes i mean john salley

24
00:01:43,75 --> 00:01:47,27
and john were very helpful they used to
help me sort through the veranda boards

25
00:01:47,27 --> 00:01:52,27
and through the you know the things i
learned i learned to see me in a different

26
00:01:52,27 --> 00:01:54,89
light to many other children i think
that their mother was a builder

27
00:01:54,89 --> 00:01:58,33
and their mother was active in providing
around shelter and things like that

28
00:01:58,33 --> 00:02:01,97
and i loved building. I found that
i love the activity of building.

29
00:02:02,78 --> 00:02:08,75
I found it very i found it very liberating
if i can use that fairly abused word.

30
00:02:08,77 --> 00:02:13,17
Because i really came into my own power.
I could make all my own decisions.

31
00:02:13,20 --> 00:02:18,10
Myself. I could have this
building exactly as i wanted it.

32
00:02:18,96 --> 00:02:23,41
I could build in whatever way
i wanted. And i can do it.

33
00:02:23,47 --> 00:02:24,55
It really wasn't so difficult

34
00:02:24,55 --> 00:02:29,33
and it really was for me the beginning of
a lot of debunking of maleness i think

35
00:02:29,33 --> 00:02:31,07
you know medicine's been very owned by me

36
00:02:31,07 --> 00:02:33,54
and i think education's been
very owned by men and i think.

37
00:02:34,04 --> 00:02:36,95
Shelter has been very own my
mean i say in recent times.

38
00:02:36,98 --> 00:02:39,38
Of course because traditionally and
i'm talking about you know hundreds

39
00:02:39,38 --> 00:02:43,50
and thousands of years ago. Women have
been all of those things the healers

40
00:02:43,50 --> 00:02:48,86
and the witches. The educators and
the builders. And the gardeners.

41
00:02:49,80 --> 00:02:50,76
So it's great for me to do

42
00:02:50,76 --> 00:02:56,13
that because it was really in keeping
with my feminist growing feminist ideas

43
00:02:56,13 --> 00:02:57,27
and ideology and.

44
00:02:58,71 --> 00:02:59,93
A lot of support from my friends

45
00:02:59,93 --> 00:03:03,41
that help me to be very organized
like a lot of the people on the farm

46
00:03:03,41 --> 00:03:06,32
or several of the people on the farm
would come and help me on a saturday

47
00:03:06,32 --> 00:03:09,08
and i would just organize
everything get everything

48
00:03:09,08 --> 00:03:14,96
and then i just use this again generously
donated labor to put all the pieces you

49
00:03:14,96 --> 00:03:20,17
know put the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle
together and tidy it up the next day

50
00:03:20,17 --> 00:03:22,65
and go for it was just great. I loved it.

51
00:03:23,89 --> 00:03:27,25
Many of my women friends came and
helped and then started coming

52
00:03:27,25 --> 00:03:33,31
and asking how do you do this to
imagine how do you do that and i die.

53
00:03:33,31 --> 00:03:36,62
They tell them what i knew which i learnt
from other builders watching other

54
00:03:36,62 --> 00:03:39,38
buildings being built running down
every friday afternoon at 5 o'clock

55
00:03:39,38 --> 00:03:43,86
and consulting bill chart of the local
buildings like how much space do you need

56
00:03:43,86 --> 00:03:47,78
around we know how many millimeters do
you leave you know in the gap for a law

57
00:03:47,78 --> 00:03:49,22
and various things like that.

58
00:03:50,59 --> 00:03:54,07
So i'd gain my get my knowledge from
books and from people and some builders

59
00:03:54,07 --> 00:03:56,80
and everywhere i could and then
i was really happy to pass

60
00:03:56,80 --> 00:03:59,95
that information on again. I thought i
mentioned earlier i really believe that for.

61
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:04,27
All information is liberation in
a way or is the way to growth.

62
00:04:04,50 --> 00:04:06,06
So i thought there was no reason

63
00:04:06,06 --> 00:04:10,22
that i should hold this disinformation
secret to myself and still

64
00:04:10,22 --> 00:04:14,57
and become part of the masons type club.

65
00:04:14,59 --> 00:04:19,69
So i would be happy to pass that
information onto women and then.

66
00:04:21,11 --> 00:04:23,70
So many women started asking me that how
do you do this or how do you do that.

67
00:04:23,73 --> 00:04:26,76
I thought i had this run a
women's building course i think

68
00:04:27,48 --> 00:04:29,47
that might sound very
presumptuous and bold

69
00:04:29,47 --> 00:04:31,93
but you know we decided to start a school.

70
00:04:31,95 --> 00:04:32,88
Primary school so

71
00:04:32,88 --> 00:04:38,19
that our kids could be educated in animal
caring loving creative way so we done

72
00:04:38,19 --> 00:04:41,49
that and i thought well you know
start a school what you know

73
00:04:41,49 --> 00:04:43,34
and in course of the kids why not start

74
00:04:43,34 --> 00:04:48,02
and i've been teaching carpentry in joinery
in the school to kids particularly

75
00:04:48,02 --> 00:04:50,61
interested in teaching
the young girls skills.

76
00:04:50,76 --> 00:04:53,93
So i sort of fronted up to
the local type of college

77
00:04:53,93 --> 00:04:59,13
and sort of like to run a building
course for women. I think of it.

78
00:05:00,43 --> 00:05:03,95
And they were rather you know the chap there
would like everyman was rather foolish

79
00:05:03,95 --> 00:05:09,55
shocked and surprised and scratch his
head and. So i did. And that was great.

80
00:05:09,76 --> 00:05:14,95
That was and i ran building courses for
women for many years not full time.

81
00:05:15,25 --> 00:05:19,65
But every time i felt there was a need
within any community like the newman

82
00:05:19,65 --> 00:05:25,25
community or broader other communities and.
Once i gathered enough women together.

83
00:05:26,03 --> 00:05:29,39
It wasn't that i gather them the
sort of the interest would start to.

84
00:05:30,43 --> 00:05:34,25
Sort of similar and i tell will gather a
group of you 12 to 20 women around you

85
00:05:34,25 --> 00:05:36,59
and when you think you've got the
numbers will approach the college

86
00:05:36,59 --> 00:05:41,24
and we were very lucky it was in those
days of supporting women's education

87
00:05:41,97 --> 00:05:46,05
and in fact encouraging women's education
particularly nontraditional so-called

88
00:05:46,05 --> 00:05:47,27
non-traditional areas.

89
00:05:47,45 --> 00:05:50,79
So i was very lucky to continue to
be able to get funding to do that

90
00:05:50,79 --> 00:05:57,53
and in later years i've gone on to run a
couple of courses which were not funded by

91
00:05:58,88 --> 00:05:59,95
the state government institute.

92
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:02,95
Mission all government institutions
but funded privately by women.

93
00:06:03,30 --> 00:06:05,04
In fact that so that's been fun.

94
00:06:06,29 --> 00:06:18,59
Yeah.

95
00:06:19,79 --> 00:06:26,56
Yeah. Yep it's spot on.

96
00:06:26,84 --> 00:06:29,13
There was a lot of there was a lot of it.

97
00:06:29,13 --> 00:06:31,56
Chauvinism i suppose we called
it chauvinism in those days

98
00:06:31,56 --> 00:06:33,63
that were double my tended
to stop using i think.

99
00:06:34,61 --> 00:06:40,68
And yes the notion of barefoot and
pregnant for women in long frocks as well.

100
00:06:43,02 --> 00:06:45,04
Was prevalent. I mean it
was one of the issues

101
00:06:45,04 --> 00:06:50,42
that i really felt uncomfortable about i
didn't necessarily feel uncomfortable

102
00:06:50,42 --> 00:06:55,32
about it within my own households fear
because we had some fairly strong women in

103
00:06:55,32 --> 00:07:00,65
that household and we all had our
deficiencies and now major hang ups

104
00:07:00,65 --> 00:07:01,27
and things like that

105
00:07:01,27 --> 00:07:06,77
but basically we encouraged each other
in our full you know full pursuit of our

106
00:07:06,77 --> 00:07:12,55
interests. But yeah that that was very
it still alarms me it still horrifies me

107
00:07:13,52 --> 00:07:16,63
that in the so-called
alternative society that

108
00:07:16,63 --> 00:07:21,21
that there is such male
chauvinism to use that word.

109
00:07:21,56 --> 00:07:24,45
There are such disrespect
for women's equal rights.

110
00:07:25,30 --> 00:07:27,59
I mean you know we still live in a
society where women don't get equal pay.

111
00:07:30,52 --> 00:07:34,10
You know women still get something like
67 per cent of the male average wage.

112
00:07:34,42 --> 00:07:37,82
You know that's the broader
community and i don't think

113
00:07:37,82 --> 00:07:42,66
that the alternative society as you know
based nimbin did very much for women's

114
00:07:42,66 --> 00:07:46,07
rights that way at all. I know that a
lot of women have gained their power

115
00:07:46,07 --> 00:07:52,92
and gone ahead and built houses and fixed
cars and been leaders of communities and.

116
00:07:52,93 --> 00:07:54,02
Community leaders

117
00:07:54,02 --> 00:07:59,34
and even have fortunately now three women
in this small city council who are older

118
00:07:59,34 --> 00:07:59,49
women.

119
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:02,67
Even though they called all the men
still i mean those things have occurred

120
00:08:03,78 --> 00:08:08,69
but i don't really even see the still very
much shift of consciousness amongst most

121
00:08:09,49 --> 00:08:12,93
of the population around women's rights.

122
00:08:14,10 --> 00:08:17,74
It's you know this is this this sort of.

123
00:08:17,75 --> 00:08:22,15
This sickness that strikes relationships.

124
00:08:22,36 --> 00:08:26,23
Quite often when people you know
heterosexual couples have children.

125
00:08:27,48 --> 00:08:31,27
And it's sort of like i have this notion
about radical talk about my notion of

126
00:08:31,27 --> 00:08:34,64
radicals many of us were radicals were
seen as radicals we were quite radical we

127
00:08:34,64 --> 00:08:37,48
were doing radically different
things and one of my notions

128
00:08:37,48 --> 00:08:43,73
or one of my theories about radicals
is that. Come a certain age time.

129
00:08:44,09 --> 00:08:49,92
And it's often around about 30. People
who are radical in their youth.

130
00:08:51,40 --> 00:08:53,92
Sort of get confronted with this.

131
00:08:55,32 --> 00:08:56,43
Energy wave or something

132
00:08:56,43 --> 00:08:59,84
and i go oh my god of i still got to keep
making up the rules for myself about

133
00:08:59,84 --> 00:09:03,63
relationships about equality about
work about social issues or

134
00:09:03,63 --> 00:09:06,45
that sort of thing and it just sort of
you know the sort of a certain city.

135
00:09:06,72 --> 00:09:09,14
Sometimes hits people about that age

136
00:09:10,68 --> 00:09:14,81
and i think a lot of people who have been
radical choose to continue to be radical

137
00:09:14,81 --> 00:09:18,25
and you know you see i see us
i mean i'm not 60 or 70 yet

138
00:09:18,25 --> 00:09:23,35
but you know i hope i'm still fairly
alert and prepared to change at

139
00:09:23,35 --> 00:09:28,15
that age 80 90 i have this vision of
me still there doing that 90 hopefully

140
00:09:28,15 --> 00:09:31,22
and i hope everybody kicks me along
particularly the kids to do that.

141
00:09:32,16 --> 00:09:34,32
And so i think some people stay radical

142
00:09:34,32 --> 00:09:39,97
and are prepared to live quite a difficult
life at times because you have to keep

143
00:09:39,97 --> 00:09:43,68
making up the rules there are no appropriate
role models anywhere in the world you

144
00:09:43,68 --> 00:09:45,14
know i mean russia's crumbled

145
00:09:45,14 --> 00:09:48,32
and it was never it never got to you know
treat women equally or anything like

146
00:09:48,32 --> 00:09:51,69
that. So there's nowhere
really that we see

147
00:09:51,69 --> 00:09:54,73
that as our there's no role models for
us so we have to keep making it up.

148
00:09:54,92 --> 00:09:58,30
I have to keep making up how to
parent my teenage children in a way

149
00:09:58,30 --> 00:09:59,13
that i hope will be.

150
00:10:01,02 --> 00:10:05,15
Lead to us having a long long term
loving relationship with each other.

151
00:10:07,63 --> 00:10:10,00
And so we have to make it up
and i'm prepared to do that

152
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:12,47
but it takes a lot of energy
that takes a lot of time

153
00:10:12,47 --> 00:10:14,61
and it takes a lot of research
and reading and talking

154
00:10:14,61 --> 00:10:18,09
and actually my god you have to actually
talk with people about these ideas you

155
00:10:18,09 --> 00:10:22,80
know you can't take anything
as given. Right. And here.

156
00:10:22,80 --> 00:10:26,38
Sally and joan are giving a perfect example
of sisterly brotherly love very nice.

157
00:10:26,50 --> 00:10:30,90
Thank you very much. And there are others

158
00:10:30,90 --> 00:10:35,49
that you get hit by this energy
wave if you will to go out to her.

159
00:10:35,73 --> 00:10:38,92
Basically i mean a conscious decision
quite often for these people

160
00:10:39,66 --> 00:10:42,35
and who basically have come from
very conservative backgrounds

161
00:10:42,35 --> 00:10:46,16
and our radic those red people's radical
years have been a reaction against

162
00:10:46,16 --> 00:10:50,38
conservatism and basically it's
easier just to follow the model

163
00:10:50,38 --> 00:10:54,12
that my dad called grandma
grandpa whoever it is set

164
00:10:54,84 --> 00:10:59,27
and a lot of you know our great an esteemed
radical leaders of the time of sunk

165
00:10:59,27 --> 00:11:05,40
back into what i would consider
considered to be fairly conservative.

166
00:11:06,16 --> 00:11:08,26
Ways i mean i want to decide boring there

167
00:11:08,26 --> 00:11:09,97
but there's a real value
judgment isn't it.

168
00:11:09,99 --> 00:11:11,33
You know and i try not to be too

169
00:11:11,33 --> 00:11:14,83
but it looks to me like these people are
actually not particularly stimulated

170
00:11:14,83 --> 00:11:17,04
that's what i mean about
boring. They seem bored.

171
00:11:17,19 --> 00:11:20,96
They seem fairly unstimulated
and seem to spend a lot of time

172
00:11:20,96 --> 00:11:26,09
and energy trying to make life look very
exciting doing essentially great time

173
00:11:26,09 --> 00:11:29,42
consuming that fairly unstimulating thing.

174
00:11:30,24 --> 00:11:34,42
That's about radicals.

175
00:11:35,17 --> 00:11:37,58
I've never been very radical
but maybe i don't know.

176
00:11:37,58 --> 00:11:40,24
I sometimes don't think i'm ready
when other people say you know.

177
00:11:40,69 --> 00:11:42,42
I don't know the answer
that i don't really care.

178
00:11:42,65 --> 00:11:44,26
I just hope i keep growing and changing

179
00:11:44,26 --> 00:11:47,30
and i hope people keep boot
me along the way to do it.

180
00:11:47,43 --> 00:11:53,69
You know i'm still constructing
you to constructing utopia.

181
00:11:53,84 --> 00:11:59,85
Oh i don't think i'd be as.
Arrogant to say that i know.

182
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,65
No that life can be pleasant. I know
that life can be fulfilling interesting.

183
00:12:04,73 --> 00:12:08,94
I know it can be so i can my life can be
surrounded by people who are loving found

184
00:12:08,94 --> 00:12:11,80
stimulating interesting. I know
the environment can be beautiful.

185
00:12:12,93 --> 00:12:15,79
I mean that's one of the other things
that i've been passionately involved with

186
00:12:15,79 --> 00:12:19,41
and that's for the protection
of the environment.

187
00:12:19,42 --> 00:12:21,76
And it was a whole other
area i suppose so.

188
00:12:21,93 --> 00:12:25,56
I think that i'm i still am i
trying to create a utopia.

189
00:12:25,64 --> 00:12:29,19
I think utopia exists in the way i
mean the other world is beautiful.

190
00:12:29,28 --> 00:12:31,80
Humans are beautiful other
species are beautiful.

191
00:12:31,81 --> 00:12:37,97
All we have to do is actually get away
from our egocentric selves in a way

192
00:12:37,97 --> 00:12:42,41
and be generous and be
willing to move over and let

193
00:12:42,41 --> 00:12:46,42
that shine around us. Really
i know that sense now.

194
00:12:46,45 --> 00:12:50,40
So that's why i'm a hippie because i say
things like that's really cosmic far out

195
00:12:50,40 --> 00:12:56,95
man. You know i'm i'm quite i'm
quite spiritual in that except to

196
00:12:56,95 --> 00:13:03,31
that extent. I always
have been i think. And.

197
00:13:03,33 --> 00:13:05,98
Still seems if you got to
have a sense of humor.

198
00:13:05,99 --> 00:13:07,83
I mean you know i take
myself very seriously.

199
00:13:07,95 --> 00:13:09,58
You know i take myself very seriously.

200
00:13:09,64 --> 00:13:13,61
I take my humor very seriously as a wonderful
t-shirt a friend of ours on the farm

201
00:13:13,61 --> 00:13:17,55
used to read which really used to
stir so many people and it said.

202
00:13:17,57 --> 00:13:19,85
I am a humorless feminist

203
00:13:21,16 --> 00:13:25,34
and i mean i just need to get such a
chuckle every time and wore that t shirt

204
00:13:25,34 --> 00:13:25,41
and

205
00:13:29,76 --> 00:13:47,53
and women.

206
00:13:48,76 --> 00:13:51,88
When i was because i can talk
about home birth number 7.

207
00:13:51,99 --> 00:13:56,32
And jonah all of the greek commonly known
as bones. Cause i can talk about that.

208
00:13:56,40 --> 00:13:59,90
Now look at my lovely daughter salim i
can also talk about her birth which was.

209
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,66
Beautiful through. It's like telling. Sex.

210
00:14:07,40 --> 00:14:10,89
As long as i have a little bit about
your dressing and i will. Ok.

211
00:14:11,24 --> 00:14:15,66
I decided to have a my second child for
we decided to have our second child at

212
00:14:15,66 --> 00:14:22,15
selling john's dad and i and we decided
to have that child at home to have

213
00:14:22,15 --> 00:14:28,56
that birth at home and so we went
about gaining support for that.

214
00:14:28,64 --> 00:14:30,45
Now i might add here that i lived at

215
00:14:30,45 --> 00:14:36,60
that time with people who were involved
in the medical psychology social work

216
00:14:36,60 --> 00:14:37,24
professions

217
00:14:37,98 --> 00:14:42,98
and they want to clean about it was a bit
of a freak out the idea of having a baby

218
00:14:42,98 --> 00:14:47,74
at home i was very clear part of having
a baby at home for me was about taking

219
00:14:47,74 --> 00:14:50,59
responsibility for myself and for my life.

220
00:14:50,70 --> 00:14:53,23
And that's what a lot of my
whole life has been about

221
00:14:53,23 --> 00:14:55,23
and that's what i want him
has been so wonderful.

222
00:14:55,49 --> 00:14:55,73
I've had

223
00:14:55,73 --> 00:15:00,77
that opportunity to take responsibility for
all aspects of my life so i was prepared

224
00:15:00,77 --> 00:15:04,95
to take responsibility for the
birth of my second child and by

225
00:15:04,95 --> 00:15:09,87
that i meant i was prepared to make decisions
around how it would be who would be

226
00:15:09,87 --> 00:15:11,35
there. What i do.

227
00:15:12,71 --> 00:15:17,47
The usual fears that any any.

228
00:15:18,25 --> 00:15:23,29
Pregnant woman goes through and father is
you know what if the child is deformed

229
00:15:23,29 --> 00:15:27,74
or not normal or dead or you know but
basically if it's if it's a deformed.

230
00:15:27,81 --> 00:15:31,40
What will i do and i was very
clear about that i'd gone through

231
00:15:31,40 --> 00:15:37,37
that with self birth i had made the doctor
who was my birth of systems at her birth

232
00:15:37,37 --> 00:15:38,62
made him promise

233
00:15:38,62 --> 00:15:45,34
that if my child my first born child
was born with obvious growth physical

234
00:15:45,35 --> 00:15:46,49
disabilities

235
00:15:47,42 --> 00:15:52,79
that would require gross amounts of medical
intervention to continue to sustain the

236
00:15:52,79 --> 00:15:55,28
life of that child that he
would promise he wouldn't take

237
00:15:55,28 --> 00:15:56,38
that medical intervention.

238
00:15:56,42 --> 00:15:59,88
Now you know he quoted hippocratic
oath to me and all sorts of things.

239
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,38
But finally i got him to do that.

240
00:16:01,44 --> 00:16:03,77
I mean you know that was a very big thing

241
00:16:03,77 --> 00:16:08,13
and it was a turning point in his career
he said for me for him to actually realize

242
00:16:08,13 --> 00:16:11,58
that it was not against the hippocratic
oath to let women take responsibility for

243
00:16:11,58 --> 00:16:13,16
their birthing process to that extent.

244
00:16:14,31 --> 00:16:16,23
So i was prepared to take
those responsibilities

245
00:16:16,23 --> 00:16:19,22
and make those decisions around
the birth of my second child.

246
00:16:20,56 --> 00:16:23,42
And i made that very clear to
our extended family members so

247
00:16:23,42 --> 00:16:26,09
that they didn't feel
responsibilities that.

248
00:16:26,48 --> 00:16:30,95
As for example the doctor in our
household felt might fall his way

249
00:16:30,95 --> 00:16:34,62
or thought is due. So we went
about having a baby at home

250
00:16:34,62 --> 00:16:39,96
and you know creating the nest
getting carol stannard carol.

251
00:16:40,01 --> 00:16:44,87
Norman stannard and dorothy smith to
be a support team actually midwife

252
00:16:44,87 --> 00:16:47,12
and support team.

253
00:16:47,14 --> 00:16:53,53
And i went into the labor
and john it was born.

254
00:16:53,95 --> 00:16:56,82
Was a beautiful birth. It was full moon.

255
00:16:57,17 --> 00:17:00,19
Hackles in the capitol
for full moon in scope.

256
00:17:00,30 --> 00:17:02,03
You know they well there's
one for the australia did

257
00:17:03,04 --> 00:17:08,37
and there were nine people at jonah's
birth. Cell of course was their cell was.

258
00:17:08,83 --> 00:17:09,94
Twenty three months old.

259
00:17:09,95 --> 00:17:10,98
Nearly two at that time

260
00:17:11,87 --> 00:17:18,71
and she had her loving other mother
beth with her as her support person.

261
00:17:18,72 --> 00:17:21,47
We work sela john was one of six
thirty eight in the morning

262
00:17:22,44 --> 00:17:27,19
and went into labor about 12
that night the night before and

263
00:17:27,20 --> 00:17:29,91
when it was obvious that
the baby was coming soon.

264
00:17:29,95 --> 00:17:30,81
Sally was woken up

265
00:17:30,81 --> 00:17:35,19
and there she was able to see her
brother brought into the world.

266
00:17:35,54 --> 00:17:41,34
She knew all about the physicality of
intercourse birth motorist everything.

267
00:17:41,44 --> 00:17:44,28
Again you know knowledge is
power or something like that.

268
00:17:44,35 --> 00:17:48,38
So she was totally aware
of what was happening.

269
00:17:48,40 --> 00:17:50,39
She knew where jonah was
going to come out and

270
00:17:50,39 --> 00:17:53,32
that the might be blood the might be water
all of those things so i don't think

271
00:17:53,32 --> 00:17:55,65
your particular phase certainly
didn't seem to be that it

272
00:17:56,54 --> 00:17:59,92
and you know i have this image of sally
in her little red dressing gown with the.

273
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,43
Ladybird that

274
00:18:01,43 --> 00:18:07,28
and down the front the held
lovingly by my my sister beth

275
00:18:08,82 --> 00:18:10,61
as jonah came into the world. I mean.

276
00:18:10,72 --> 00:18:14,78
And they were these nine people who fell
in love with this baby as he literally

277
00:18:14,78 --> 00:18:17,68
popped out put his little hand
out grabbed carol's finger

278
00:18:17,68 --> 00:18:19,15
and came into the world

279
00:18:19,15 --> 00:18:23,07
and then the rest of the family the rest
of the farm came within minutes of his

280
00:18:23,07 --> 00:18:25,80
birth and all flocked around
and do garden or rest

281
00:18:25,80 --> 00:18:29,27
and i mean what i want to say about
that was that it was just so wonderful.

282
00:18:29,59 --> 00:18:32,20
The experience with sally had
been sure to be my first birth

283
00:18:32,20 --> 00:18:37,51
and then in hospital i felt
very isolated i was the only.

284
00:18:37,53 --> 00:18:41,87
Woman who was demand feeding her child
in this hospital environment then i

285
00:18:41,87 --> 00:18:42,94
discovered this one other woman.

286
00:18:43,15 --> 00:18:44,53
Fortunately who'd had six children

287
00:18:45,48 --> 00:18:47,93
and who actually taught me
how to demand feed my child

288
00:18:47,93 --> 00:18:49,77
and i learned how to demand food much of

289
00:18:49,77 --> 00:18:52,15
that is you had to get the nurses
to bring that child to you

290
00:18:52,15 --> 00:18:53,11
when the child woke up

291
00:18:53,11 --> 00:18:56,40
and cried because we weren't allowed to
have our babies next to us during the night

292
00:18:56,40 --> 00:18:57,71
that was a trauma for me.

293
00:18:57,79 --> 00:19:00,86
All i want was my baby next to me and i
would be all right thank you very much.

294
00:19:02,76 --> 00:19:05,05
So the experience was that
from that was i learned

295
00:19:05,05 --> 00:19:07,23
that i really wanted my baby with
me when it was born. Thanks.

296
00:19:07,27 --> 00:19:07,88
After i was born

297
00:19:07,88 --> 00:19:12,73
and so that's what one of the reasons
i chose to have it journal time and.

298
00:19:13,03 --> 00:19:16,86
It was wonderful because like i'd gone to
bed the night before i'd gone into labor.

299
00:19:16,93 --> 00:19:20,74
I'd had a baby at 6:30 8:00 in the morning
i got up afterwards and had a shower.

300
00:19:20,87 --> 00:19:24,78
I'd run the family in sydney at about 8
o'clock a lovely little baby boy you know.

301
00:19:25,43 --> 00:19:30,55
And i'd gone back rested for the rest of
the day but i wandered around you know

302
00:19:30,55 --> 00:19:33,52
when said a lot of the goats and the
cows and the chooks and the case

303
00:19:33,52 --> 00:19:36,79
and the ducks and the vegie garden
and i mean just seemed to me

304
00:19:36,79 --> 00:19:42,16
that home birth was just a part of life
instead of being this great big you know

305
00:19:42,16 --> 00:19:48,49
that it was really very eventful. But
my life went on as well. Very easily.

306
00:19:48,61 --> 00:19:49,96
I wasn't estranged

307
00:19:49,96 --> 00:19:55,00
or taken away from my daughter she was
there she sort of sat there and held him

308
00:19:55,00 --> 00:19:59,92
and touched him and pushed and
probe and tasted like rim.

309
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:01,71
Sell putting a what does it taste like.

310
00:20:01,88 --> 00:20:02,74
I will taste him

311
00:20:02,74 --> 00:20:05,59
and find out she sort of you know i
mean that's not the sort of thing

312
00:20:05,59 --> 00:20:08,90
that can happen in a
hospital and. Very nice.

313
00:20:08,93 --> 00:20:11,90
I think so because i mean a
new baby taste delicious.

314
00:20:12,27 --> 00:20:16,79
Oh this just this beautiful
succulent little new being you know

315
00:20:16,79 --> 00:20:21,57
and so all of those things would have
felt like a continuation of my life.

316
00:20:21,73 --> 00:20:24,34
Normally and. It was lovely.

317
00:20:24,43 --> 00:20:25,99
It was wonderful and from

318
00:20:25,99 --> 00:20:31,18
that i decided well there aren't enough
of these women have a visit home so we

319
00:20:31,18 --> 00:20:35,61
formed the birth of beyond group.
We'd formed and i think just before.

320
00:20:36,14 --> 00:20:40,16
You know about the time i'd have to look
up the dates very much around journalists

321
00:20:40,16 --> 00:20:44,12
the carol and others formed us and beyond

322
00:20:44,12 --> 00:20:47,46
and we decided we'd help as
many families as we could

323
00:20:47,46 --> 00:20:51,99
and to have their babies in the
manner in which they chose so that if

324
00:20:51,99 --> 00:20:55,11
that meant supporting a woman to
have a child in hospital we do

325
00:20:55,11 --> 00:20:58,70
that if it meant supporting a woman
through as much of her labor at home

326
00:20:58,70 --> 00:21:00,76
and then it being necessary
for her to go to hospital

327
00:21:00,76 --> 00:21:02,50
or being her choice to
go to hospital would do

328
00:21:02,50 --> 00:21:05,80
that if it meant choosing to
have a baby at home we do that.

329
00:21:05,85 --> 00:21:11,49
So i started to learn
midwifery skills and you know

330
00:21:11,49 --> 00:21:14,73
that involved taking risks
and we were paid to do it

331
00:21:14,73 --> 00:21:19,06
and we had to negotiate with the medical
profession in lismore of course to be have

332
00:21:19,06 --> 00:21:21,73
them as our support people when
we didn't know what to do or

333
00:21:21,73 --> 00:21:24,88
when we didn't count the difficulties
or difficult the things like that

334
00:21:24,88 --> 00:21:27,90
and we had to face. You know
charges are irresponsible.

335
00:21:28,49 --> 00:21:30,62
I don't think it's irresponsible
to have your baby at home.

336
00:21:30,76 --> 00:21:33,90
I think is a very responsible act.

337
00:21:33,92 --> 00:21:37,12
So it was a guide it was one of those
very powerful times for me i grew a lot

338
00:21:37,12 --> 00:21:37,54
through that experience.

339
00:21:38,07 --> 00:21:42,74
I loved helping women have their
babies at home it was a real honor.

340
00:21:43,65 --> 00:21:46,06
It's an honor to be around.
It's an honor to be around this

341
00:21:46,89 --> 00:21:50,23
and in later times i've moved towards
helping friends towards their death

342
00:21:50,23 --> 00:21:56,22
and it's been. You know it's reclaiming.
The rights to all aspects of our lives.

343
00:21:56,40 --> 00:21:59,83
It's reclaiming the right to
have control over our lives to.

344
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:04,44
God shelter to provide education to
provide food to provide birthing

345
00:22:04,44 --> 00:22:06,26
and death in a way that we

346
00:22:07,75 --> 00:22:12,87
that we want to do it.

347
00:22:15,69 --> 00:22:16,80
How long was i in then.

348
00:22:16,98 --> 00:22:19,36
Gee i don't even like putting years over

349
00:22:19,36 --> 00:22:22,69
that you know i was in nimbin for some
of the most formative years of my life.

350
00:22:24,05 --> 00:22:24,34
And

351
00:22:25,21 --> 00:22:28,58
and i'm grateful for the experience of
having been there i think it was something

352
00:22:28,58 --> 00:22:34,53
like 11 years i lived in then and because
you see i lived community in the city

353
00:22:34,53 --> 00:22:36,34
and it was all it's all part
of the continuum isn't it.

354
00:22:37,80 --> 00:22:40,33
Where am i now you know i
mean i live at the beach

355
00:22:40,33 --> 00:22:43,83
but i still see myself as
part of an extended family.

356
00:22:43,85 --> 00:22:47,52
So i lived in them then at the
same time same community and

357
00:22:47,52 --> 00:22:51,60
when my partner charlie and
i met and fell in love.

358
00:22:51,72 --> 00:22:53,73
We lived part time at kind of all falls

359
00:22:53,73 --> 00:22:59,07
and part time nimbin trying to work out
how we would negotiate the physicality of

360
00:22:59,07 --> 00:23:02,67
our you know where would
we have our domicile.

361
00:23:04,08 --> 00:23:09,29
But mainly i lived i stayed at paradise i
never moved on from there till we left

362
00:23:11,01 --> 00:23:13,87
and it was great. Like.

363
00:23:13,92 --> 00:23:18,99
So although it was 11 years short
it was you know have a lot of money

364
00:23:18,99 --> 00:23:21,10
or something and i don't know and
i don't really know how to put

365
00:23:21,10 --> 00:23:24,12
that in terms of in words because i'm
just grateful for that experience

366
00:23:25,16 --> 00:23:31,44
and in a way i've never left him and.

367
00:23:31,46 --> 00:23:37,82
I live it's you know in a beautiful
environment on the beach now and.

368
00:23:37,84 --> 00:23:42,11
But you know it's like it's
still part of the still

369
00:23:42,11 --> 00:23:45,92
when i think of home that's part of my
concept of home i mean i have very many

370
00:23:45,92 --> 00:23:49,09
when i think of home many parts of
the world in a way fit into that

371
00:23:49,09 --> 00:23:52,28
that image for me now and then
certainly a large part of

372
00:23:52,28 --> 00:23:55,98
that i've still got thoughts of defense
they still have contact they have recently

373
00:23:55,98 --> 00:24:01,01
been involved in teaching a course
to teenagers their. It's not.

374
00:24:01,14 --> 00:24:03,51
I mean i don't even think
that you have to leave places

375
00:24:04,22 --> 00:24:05,83
and that's part of what i think i learnt.

376
00:24:07,07 --> 00:24:09,71
Living at nimbin is that you can
have these connections and bonds

377
00:24:09,71 --> 00:24:13,70
and you know never have to leave
you just not there at the moment.

378
00:24:16,06 --> 00:24:17,95
But of how that attitude. Why did i.

379
00:24:17,97 --> 00:24:22,94
And why did i move away from nimbin might
be a better way of putting that question.

380
00:24:22,96 --> 00:24:29,67
And that's that's a very long answer in the
way it was after a long time of living

381
00:24:29,67 --> 00:24:32,36
in one place i think i was
really ready for a change.

382
00:24:33,79 --> 00:24:38,07
And i become in over the years more

383
00:24:38,07 --> 00:24:41,08
and more involved in women's education.

384
00:24:41,88 --> 00:24:47,85
And i think a lot of the issues of
women's equality haven't been addressed.

385
00:24:49,73 --> 00:24:53,42
Or hadn't been addressed by most
of the members of the community.

386
00:24:53,44 --> 00:24:58,18
And one of the difficult issues that
we went through were issues of.

387
00:24:58,64 --> 00:25:00,07
Incest within the family.

388
00:25:00,32 --> 00:25:01,06
I didn't feel

389
00:25:01,06 --> 00:25:05,63
that our family adequately our extended
family adequately addressed those issues to

390
00:25:05,63 --> 00:25:06,54
the satisfaction

391
00:25:07,54 --> 00:25:14,36
and to the to the recovery of the young
children involved young women involved.

392
00:25:14,38 --> 00:25:15,79
And i really you know that was

393
00:25:16,50 --> 00:25:20,85
that was part of my i'd already moved to
the coast for work work was one of the

394
00:25:20,85 --> 00:25:22,82
reasons.

395
00:25:22,83 --> 00:25:23,61
Some of the issues

396
00:25:23,61 --> 00:25:27,76
that care of the environment were certainly
involved some of the disagreements

397
00:25:27,76 --> 00:25:31,86
within the community about how we would
actually care for this very beautiful

398
00:25:31,86 --> 00:25:36,42
environment and it wasn't
that i was opposed.

399
00:25:36,44 --> 00:25:37,96
I think it was just as

400
00:25:37,96 --> 00:25:39,91
when i think in particular i
think i was ready for a change

401
00:25:39,91 --> 00:25:45,84
and i was ready to try to be in a situation
where again i could be in a situation

402
00:25:45,84 --> 00:25:49,28
where i could have.

403
00:25:50,49 --> 00:25:54,84
Control over some of the important choices
i don't mean control in a negative way

404
00:25:55,61 --> 00:26:02,06
more in the gaining power by
being responsible. Your choices.

405
00:26:02,08 --> 00:26:03,86
I'm not saying this very
well it's a bit muddled.

406
00:26:04,96 --> 00:26:07,18
So i might have to rephrase some of this.

407
00:26:07,19 --> 00:26:09,39
Some of the reasons that i
moved away from them then.

408
00:26:11,51 --> 00:26:15,23
Involved moving to a place
where we could but charlie

409
00:26:15,23 --> 00:26:21,28
and i were able to find for work more
easily without long distances of travelling

410
00:26:22,20 --> 00:26:23,94
and i was really ready for change.

411
00:26:24,23 --> 00:26:27,86
I think after a long period of
commitment to community living.

412
00:26:27,88 --> 00:26:28,93
At paradise valley

413
00:26:28,93 --> 00:26:35,85
and still love living community
in an extended family.

414
00:26:37,06 --> 00:26:40,44
I wanted to be able to be in a situation
where some of the social issues

415
00:26:40,44 --> 00:26:44,08
that are really important to me were
really being fully addressed within my own

416
00:26:44,08 --> 00:26:48,36
household and some of those issues
for me. Issues of addiction.

417
00:26:48,79 --> 00:26:53,45
I really want to live in a drug free
household for myself and for the kids.

418
00:26:54,27 --> 00:26:57,90
I want to live in a you know situation
where people really are prepared

419
00:26:57,90 --> 00:27:01,96
and brave enough to take on social issues
like dealing with incest which wasn't

420
00:27:01,96 --> 00:27:07,26
adequately dealt with in my view in the
community and. Issues of the environment.

421
00:27:07,92 --> 00:27:13,25
And i don't i don't think we were able
as a group to come together very well

422
00:27:13,25 --> 00:27:16,57
and make really significant. Radical.

423
00:27:17,10 --> 00:27:20,06
Decisions about care of the
environment and those were the things

424
00:27:20,06 --> 00:27:22,94
that were sort of happening at the time
that i was really ready to make my move.

425
00:27:23,20 --> 00:27:26,96
And as those issues became difficult i
mean you asked whether some life there was

426
00:27:26,96 --> 00:27:29,04
very difficult because it was
difficult trying to not all of

427
00:27:29,04 --> 00:27:31,16
that up with you know many different
people from different backgrounds

428
00:27:31,16 --> 00:27:32,50
and different ideologies

429
00:27:33,23 --> 00:27:36,47
and we didn't have any bonding ideology
you didn't have to pass a test to come

430
00:27:36,47 --> 00:27:41,06
there. So as that i think that some
of those issues were quite difficult

431
00:27:41,06 --> 00:27:45,02
and i was i guess a little wearied
of putting in such intense energy

432
00:27:47,81 --> 00:27:50,99
constantly on some of those issues.

433
00:27:52,13 --> 00:27:56,19
And education was one of the issues
that that was involved in my move

434
00:27:57,01 --> 00:27:59,96
and the kids dad wasn't particular.

435
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,76
Satisfied with the notion of them continuing
high school sorts of education at

436
00:28:03,76 --> 00:28:05,48
nimbin and so charlie

437
00:28:05,48 --> 00:28:09,62
and i decided to be in a situation where
the availability of high schools would be

438
00:28:09,62 --> 00:28:10,84
more acceptable to their dad

439
00:28:11,68 --> 00:28:17,01
and you know to make life easier easier
for the kids hopefully so there were all

440
00:28:17,01 --> 00:28:19,90
these various issues that came into it.

441
00:28:21,91 --> 00:28:23,44
And one of the issues was

442
00:28:23,44 --> 00:28:27,11
that we were ready to travel with the
kids would promise the kids we'd take two

443
00:28:27,11 --> 00:28:29,07
or charlie promised the kids
he'd take them to america

444
00:28:29,07 --> 00:28:35,65
and disneyland before salvage 12 and sally
very sort of wisely reminded charlie.

445
00:28:35,67 --> 00:28:39,13
Some 12 month or two years before
that you get i'm nearly 12

446
00:28:39,13 --> 00:28:40,21
and you have this promise.

447
00:28:40,24 --> 00:28:43,98
So we actually had to make sure that
we could earn our income earners

448
00:28:43,99 --> 00:28:47,33
and i think come to to take these wild
adventure of you know just heading off

449
00:28:47,33 --> 00:28:51,61
overseas for half a year
or so. So all of those.

450
00:28:51,63 --> 00:28:53,31
And influenced me

451
00:28:54,29 --> 00:28:59,59
and you know i just i just saw my moving
on from nimbin a bit as being just another

452
00:28:59,59 --> 00:29:03,62
opportunity for me to grow in other
ways and to take a lot of the learning

453
00:29:03,62 --> 00:29:06,26
that i have learnt from an indian
out into the broader community.

454
00:29:06,75 --> 00:29:10,34
I mean you know like we were looking
after our environment through the forest

455
00:29:10,34 --> 00:29:13,56
campaigns that i was very intimately
involved with and things like

456
00:29:13,56 --> 00:29:14,47
that we were doing some of

457
00:29:14,47 --> 00:29:19,13
that we've got we've got the rainforest
policy for new south wales establish we've

458
00:29:19,13 --> 00:29:23,89
got the multiple occupancy changes in
local government occur and things like

459
00:29:23,89 --> 00:29:25,11
that we do stablish schools

460
00:29:25,11 --> 00:29:29,98
but here we were you know across byron bay
he's an environment still being ravaged

461
00:29:29,98 --> 00:29:34,67
so you know part of what i've done since
being out here is to establish with others

462
00:29:34,67 --> 00:29:38,08
and environments into here and
you know things like that.

463
00:29:38,16 --> 00:29:41,57
So you know it's just an opportunity to go

464
00:29:41,57 --> 00:29:52,06
and expand somewhere else.

465
00:29:52,96 --> 00:29:59,62
Oh oh.

466
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:03,98
What a question the question being what
made the community ineffectual with dealing

467
00:30:03,98 --> 00:30:10,79
with child abuse. Patriarca
all patriarchal overlay.

468
00:30:10,80 --> 00:30:14,65
Yeah. You want me to repeat it.
Like what made it made it what.

469
00:30:15,26 --> 00:30:20,08
Why was the community ineffectual in dealing
with child abuse within the community.

470
00:30:21,70 --> 00:30:23,14
I wish i really knew the answer to

471
00:30:23,14 --> 00:30:26,56
that i can only i'm still
only guessing at some of that

472
00:30:26,56 --> 00:30:28,63
and it's very easy to
make generalizations.

473
00:30:28,65 --> 00:30:33,31
I think one of the reasons the community
wasn't effective in dealing with child

474
00:30:33,31 --> 00:30:38,02
abuse was that many of the
men in the community.

475
00:30:38,07 --> 00:30:41,08
Most of the men in the community.

476
00:30:41,10 --> 00:30:47,03
Basically felt it was okay and i'm
really saddened to have to say that.

477
00:30:48,18 --> 00:30:48,83
I don't think

478
00:30:48,83 --> 00:30:52,43
that very many men were prepared to
look at their own sexuality their own

479
00:30:52,43 --> 00:30:55,58
objectification of women and children.

480
00:30:55,59 --> 00:31:01,61
And to come to make some growth steps
through that i think many of the men felt.

481
00:31:01,72 --> 00:31:07,39
Oh yeah. But i've been a bit like
that myself. Therefore it must be ok.

482
00:31:08,67 --> 00:31:12,47
I don't think there were very many women
who were brave enough to speak out against

483
00:31:12,47 --> 00:31:15,26
their partners although in
private conversations with me.

484
00:31:15,27 --> 00:31:19,24
Many of the women would when it came to a.

485
00:31:21,23 --> 00:31:24,83
Confrontation situation
which it indeed was.

486
00:31:24,85 --> 00:31:28,58
Those women were too threatened
about their relationships i think.

487
00:31:28,93 --> 00:31:29,45
And that's that's

488
00:31:29,45 --> 00:31:33,41
when we talked earlier about sexism within
communities we didn't used to call it

489
00:31:33,41 --> 00:31:35,64
sexism but i think that the
print appropriate word to use.

490
00:31:35,71 --> 00:31:40,20
I don't think issues of sexism have been
dealt with in individual communities

491
00:31:40,20 --> 00:31:44,72
or the community at large and
i'm very saddened by that

492
00:31:46,56 --> 00:31:49,03
and i can only do that myself and it.
