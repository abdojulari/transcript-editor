1
00:00:16,37 --> 00:00:23,93
Why do you think of two more
speaking with graeme dunstan.

2
00:00:24,80 --> 00:00:30,35
And i'm graham dunstan i was the director
of the aquarius festival in 1973.

3
00:00:30,97 --> 00:00:34,42
And i came back to nim and as an im

4
00:00:34,42 --> 00:00:39,20
and resident between 1974 74 and 180

5
00:00:39,90 --> 00:00:41,64
and worked on community
development in them

6
00:00:41,64 --> 00:00:45,12
but so i have an intimate
association with the post aquarius.

7
00:00:46,31 --> 00:00:47,50
Community development there

8
00:00:47,50 --> 00:00:53,69
and then how did you come to
be involved in the areas.

9
00:00:55,36 --> 00:00:59,10
We know. Goes back to.

10
00:00:59,12 --> 00:01:00,35
The beginning of the sixties

11
00:01:00,35 --> 00:01:04,58
and i went from school in the
duntroon as a military cadet.

12
00:01:05,52 --> 00:01:09,85
And i became very disillusioned
with what was happening as a cadet.

13
00:01:09,86 --> 00:01:14,43
In the army just worked out that
the army wasn't for me this is

14
00:01:14,43 --> 00:01:19,84
that the time of intense bastardisation.
Initiation the same time the university.

15
00:01:20,09 --> 00:01:23,70
That duntroon try and become
an academy and grant degrees.

16
00:01:23,93 --> 00:01:26,17
So i wouldn't want to get it to have.

17
00:01:26,57 --> 00:01:30,02
Academic training and that same time
your life was run by drill sergeants

18
00:01:31,33 --> 00:01:35,32
and most immediate concerns
was polishing your boots.

19
00:01:35,34 --> 00:01:38,60
So i feel sort of distinguished
myself academically

20
00:01:38,60 --> 00:01:43,38
but had increasingly problems became
the most punished get it done through.

21
00:01:44,48 --> 00:01:48,58
And during that time was under a lot
of pressure to resign and get out

22
00:01:48,58 --> 00:01:52,33
and i was hanging in there so i could get
the academic qualification would give me

23
00:01:52,33 --> 00:01:55,08
some exemptions at university.

24
00:01:55,10 --> 00:01:59,86
And the university at peered to me
then to be some sort of salvation.

25
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,01
Like my ideal as a place
i really wanted to be.

26
00:02:04,03 --> 00:02:04,82
And so it was

27
00:02:04,82 --> 00:02:10,01
that i enrolled at university first at
melbourne uni university for a year doing

28
00:02:10,01 --> 00:02:11,08
engineering.

29
00:02:11,09 --> 00:02:17,03
And i was approached by asio
and asked to attend meetings.

30
00:02:17,49 --> 00:02:22,62
You know to see what had happened was i
thought well i've got all this military

31
00:02:22,62 --> 00:02:23,69
training want to do with it

32
00:02:24,53 --> 00:02:28,41
and so i applied to join the squadron
university squadron and hope

33
00:02:28,41 --> 00:02:29,89
that i'd learn to fly and i was rejected.

34
00:02:30,29 --> 00:02:33,46
But they say we've got something
more important for you.

35
00:02:34,32 --> 00:02:38,15
You know approached by these two guys
from a zero saying we want you to attend

36
00:02:38,15 --> 00:02:40,14
meetings and give us reports
about what's going on

37
00:02:41,34 --> 00:02:43,31
and being straight out of the army

38
00:02:43,31 --> 00:02:46,67
and straight out of school having
no political sophistication at all.

39
00:02:46,75 --> 00:02:51,43
I said well it sounds like to me i wanted.
I want to go to these meetings anyway.

40
00:02:51,45 --> 00:02:58,08
So i became my regular lunch time at the
university not to sit with engineering

41
00:02:58,08 --> 00:03:01,95
students down the engineering faculty but
actually plug into all these meetings

42
00:03:01,95 --> 00:03:03,83
that were happening.

43
00:03:03,84 --> 00:03:07,48
And of course the more meetings i tended
to the more interested i became in the

44
00:03:07,48 --> 00:03:09,64
agenda of the left

45
00:03:09,64 --> 00:03:13,01
and particularly the information about what
was happening in southeast asia because

46
00:03:13,01 --> 00:03:15,80
i had some inkling in this one
as a duntroon they were already.

47
00:03:16,31 --> 00:03:18,46
Briefing us about south east asia

48
00:03:18,46 --> 00:03:22,27
and preparing officers for
a south east asian war

49
00:03:22,27 --> 00:03:26,22
and part of the tension with duntroon
was they changed the conditions

50
00:03:26,22 --> 00:03:27,31
that they announced

51
00:03:27,31 --> 00:03:30,08
that they weren't going to accept any
more resignations of officers they were

52
00:03:30,08 --> 00:03:32,54
actually going to build
up the army at that time.

53
00:03:33,66 --> 00:03:34,29
So if i said

54
00:03:34,29 --> 00:03:37,48
that the commission after duntroon i would
have been in for a lifetime was what

55
00:03:37,48 --> 00:03:40,78
they were telling us. And.

56
00:03:40,80 --> 00:03:44,75
So i thought well this is the other side
of the coin finding out from the left.

57
00:03:44,91 --> 00:03:47,51
What's going on in southeast asia.

58
00:03:47,53 --> 00:03:51,48
The year after i did one year at melbourne
university then transferred to the

59
00:03:51,48 --> 00:03:54,25
university of new south wales and.

60
00:03:55,09 --> 00:03:57,48
Again attended meetings got very
interested in the labor club

61
00:03:57,48 --> 00:03:59,94
and the difference between
the university new south.

62
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:00,37
Wells

63
00:04:01,22 --> 00:04:04,54
and the university of melbourne was university
new south wales the very new campus

64
00:04:04,54 --> 00:04:07,30
in the didn't have the
infrastructure of student clubs

65
00:04:07,30 --> 00:04:12,92
and societies at the old university had
so i felt behove the start creating it.

66
00:04:12,93 --> 00:04:15,27
So i started organizing my
own meetings my own talks

67
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:19,96
and again i was approached by a
cio and to get back into it.

68
00:04:20,04 --> 00:04:22,78
I think i had about four
meetings at this time

69
00:04:23,85 --> 00:04:26,89
but eventually i was elected
president of the labour club

70
00:04:27,62 --> 00:04:33,08
and i had to tell as i was too compromising
to be president of the labor club at

71
00:04:33,08 --> 00:04:38,17
the university new south
wales. So i became.

72
00:04:38,18 --> 00:04:41,76
Thanks to the initiation those you
know offered me a very active.

73
00:04:42,27 --> 00:04:47,51
Student organizer and involved in
the initial moratorium initial.

74
00:04:48,31 --> 00:04:53,44
Teachings and inviting people to talk
about what was happening on the campus

75
00:04:54,45 --> 00:04:56,86
and from the labor club they
became present the student union

76
00:04:56,86 --> 00:04:58,69
and entered the student newspaper.

77
00:04:59,30 --> 00:05:04,60
Full time student activist along
with a full time engineering degree.

78
00:05:05,43 --> 00:05:07,65
And.

79
00:05:07,67 --> 00:05:14,54
Became one of the principal organizers
of the protest movement on the campus.

80
00:05:15,66 --> 00:05:20,53
I came back to the i
graduated in 1967 and.

81
00:05:22,02 --> 00:05:24,44
Work the next year. 68 full term.

82
00:05:24,44 --> 00:05:29,04
I was a country member i had a job
as a computer programmer for a while

83
00:05:29,04 --> 00:05:31,46
and then came back to
the university in 170.

84
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:34,68
To do a degree in sociology

85
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:39,70
and was again invited to re-engage
in student politics and

86
00:05:39,70 --> 00:05:42,93
that was the year of the when
he bagan editing at the rank

87
00:05:42,93 --> 00:05:44,67
and i was the director
of student publications.

88
00:05:44,85 --> 00:05:49,22
So i was right back in the
thick of the organising and.

89
00:05:50,51 --> 00:05:52,19
By this time i got to appreciate this.

90
00:05:52,33 --> 00:05:54,54
These were the moratorium
years got to appreciate that.

91
00:05:54,62 --> 00:05:59,62
What was really working with the anti-war
movement nanny conscription movement was.

92
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,05
Not so much giving people information and
talking at people for public meetings

93
00:06:04,80 --> 00:06:05,17
but so

94
00:06:05,17 --> 00:06:10,47
but more the the cultural movement the sense
of every time we had a protest in the

95
00:06:10,47 --> 00:06:16,06
street it was a festival. So this time
was sort of introduced to the king.

96
00:06:16,74 --> 00:06:21,88
And i think one day at the sort of statement
about the power of joy caught my eye

97
00:06:21,88 --> 00:06:25,75
and i began to realize that the way
you can create cultural movement

98
00:06:25,75 --> 00:06:30,30
and remember as doing sociologist was to
create events where people sheer joy.

99
00:06:30,69 --> 00:06:33,21
So i got very interested in this strategy

100
00:06:33,21 --> 00:06:36,22
and whenever we organized an event on the
campus we'd always do it with a band.

101
00:06:36,40 --> 00:06:41,82
It was like a celebration. So i
got very interested in festivals.

102
00:06:42,30 --> 00:06:48,90
In 1971 the aquarius foundation of the
australian unionist dude nsw had a

103
00:06:48,91 --> 00:06:54,17
festival i think was the first aquarius
festival on the campus of the university of

104
00:06:55,13 --> 00:07:00,68
a and it was a in the national
australian national university.

105
00:07:00,70 --> 00:07:04,07
And this was an extraordinary
festival and i went along.

106
00:07:06,05 --> 00:07:06,41
And was delighted

107
00:07:06,41 --> 00:07:11,58
that at the the activity because students
come from all around australia at this

108
00:07:11,58 --> 00:07:14,44
time the australian union of
students was a very strong union.

109
00:07:15,33 --> 00:07:19,98
It had an escalating membership
as more cias were brought online

110
00:07:19,98 --> 00:07:21,96
and sort of welcome into the fold

111
00:07:21,96 --> 00:07:24,46
and every student was paying
50 cents to be a member.

112
00:07:25,88 --> 00:07:29,80
So it had a sort of an increasing budget
and had more and more departments

113
00:07:29,80 --> 00:07:34,74
that was opening up. And the australian new
students at that time was responsible.

114
00:07:34,83 --> 00:07:36,33
It had travel france

115
00:07:36,33 --> 00:07:42,16
that it sort of taken off like a rocket
its abs goal department which was

116
00:07:42,16 --> 00:07:46,32
regionally about raising money to get
students aboriginal students through

117
00:07:46,32 --> 00:07:49,33
university it had picked up on
the land land rights issue.

118
00:07:49,36 --> 00:07:53,07
The education department was writing the
agenda for the labor party the education

119
00:07:53,07 --> 00:07:56,68
agenda for the labor party
international apart

120
00:07:56,68 --> 00:07:59,79
and all these kind of things happening.
It had been an organisation that.

121
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,20
I've listened to being under control
of the cia funding and stuff

122
00:08:04,20 --> 00:08:09,46
and it sort of done this huge turn during
the late sixties and early seventies.

123
00:08:10,17 --> 00:08:13,98
And one of the things that it created
was a cultural arm and the idea was

124
00:08:13,98 --> 00:08:19,97
that the aquarius foundation would be
responsible for campus tours of artists

125
00:08:19,97 --> 00:08:24,34
and speakers and it was a vision of
this sort of national organizing body

126
00:08:25,40 --> 00:08:28,46
and then every two years it would
organize a festival which was originally

127
00:08:28,46 --> 00:08:32,20
conceived of as being
bringing all the end.

128
00:08:32,56 --> 00:08:36,38
Into varsity groups together so that
all the dramatic societies would come

129
00:08:36,38 --> 00:08:43,10
and perform at this festival and all the
debating society would come. You already.

130
00:08:43,66 --> 00:08:45,47
All the dramatic societies

131
00:08:45,47 --> 00:08:48,07
and all the debating societies the corals
the sides would come together in one

132
00:08:48,07 --> 00:08:53,13
place and have a festival or when
they came together it a new in 1971.

133
00:08:54,68 --> 00:09:00,59
Something else spun off the synergy of
the situation was having all those.

134
00:09:00,61 --> 00:09:03,65
Embassy is in symbols of authority.

135
00:09:03,67 --> 00:09:05,80
The students were extremely reactive

136
00:09:05,80 --> 00:09:11,64
and like every day a protest would be
organised so that. The four meant of the.

137
00:09:11,65 --> 00:09:15,89
Of the the festival wasn't so much around
the programme of events which was quite

138
00:09:15,89 --> 00:09:18,47
interesting in itself but
the student activity

139
00:09:18,47 --> 00:09:21,81
that arose spontaneously from all these
student activists coming from all around

140
00:09:21,81 --> 00:09:23,22
australia to one place.

141
00:09:24,74 --> 00:09:29,64
Now i was greatly stimulated by this
and utter overturned the sydney.

142
00:09:30,46 --> 00:09:32,08
I had a meeting with johnny allen

143
00:09:32,08 --> 00:09:38,36
and johnny allen was an old
friend who had been doing.

144
00:09:38,38 --> 00:09:42,25
Arts a drama degree at the university
and i'd known him through his.

145
00:09:42,72 --> 00:09:44,28
Theatre organisation

146
00:09:45,46 --> 00:09:50,32
and he'd after leaving university had taken
up an organized among other things the

147
00:09:51,06 --> 00:09:54,09
sort of the arts factory in surry
hills which was like the first rock

148
00:09:54,09 --> 00:09:54,70
and roll venue

149
00:09:54,70 --> 00:09:58,52
and was very interested in organising
festivals countercultural festivals.

150
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,73
In 1971 i got to say i was editor of
the university paper against the ranga

151
00:10:04,73 --> 00:10:10,38
and i was running it on the theme of the
counterculture had been greatly influenced

152
00:10:10,38 --> 00:10:14,65
by theodore rose a book called the making
the counterculture so i was looking

153
00:10:14,65 --> 00:10:20,00
around to see what sort of changes were
coming as a result of the impact of the

154
00:10:20,00 --> 00:10:23,84
anti-war movement to conscription movement
what sort of cultural things were

155
00:10:23,84 --> 00:10:24,35
arising

156
00:10:25,56 --> 00:10:31,36
and each edition of the paper each week we
would produce invite a guest editor in.

157
00:10:32,05 --> 00:10:38,39
And explore a particular theme so the
themes typically were anti-psychiatry.

158
00:10:39,48 --> 00:10:49,52
Ecology health foods spirituality drugs.

159
00:10:49,54 --> 00:10:55,16
Such themes such they and i had cause to
talk to john allen about some of this

160
00:10:55,16 --> 00:10:57,35
and we had a meeting which was a day.

161
00:10:57,38 --> 00:11:02,28
Why have all places and johnny had
been at the chorus festival in a day

162
00:11:02,28 --> 00:11:07,36
and you too. And we sort of sat
down compared notes and both agreed

163
00:11:07,36 --> 00:11:10,79
that it was an extraordinary event
to bring students together this time

164
00:11:10,79 --> 00:11:14,49
and probably the program was
getting in the way at the festival

165
00:11:15,50 --> 00:11:20,06
and wouldn't it be a great idea if we
would organize a festival of students.

166
00:11:21,59 --> 00:11:25,50
And not have the standard arts program

167
00:11:25,51 --> 00:11:30,09
but rather take the festival away from a
university where it had all those symbols

168
00:11:30,10 --> 00:11:34,46
of authority to react to and ask the
question what are we for right.

169
00:11:34,53 --> 00:11:36,27
Make it a lifestyle festival

170
00:11:36,27 --> 00:11:39,61
and put the question to people what do
you believe in what kind of future.

171
00:11:39,79 --> 00:11:41,99
Do you want to create.

172
00:11:43,29 --> 00:11:44,76
Well we walked up

173
00:11:44,76 --> 00:11:49,71
and down the street the beach talking about
this wonderful thing we finished with

174
00:11:49,71 --> 00:11:54,93
agreement that i would write an
article about it for the australian.

175
00:11:56,50 --> 00:12:00,06
You know australian university student
australian unionist tune. Yes.

176
00:12:00,09 --> 00:12:04,41
Publication called national you
which i did and it was published

177
00:12:04,41 --> 00:12:09,12
and i forgot about it and done that
and in one hundred seventy two.

178
00:12:09,30 --> 00:12:12,85
I was teaching blacktown boys high school

179
00:12:12,85 --> 00:12:17,23
when i received a call from the organizers
of the aquarius foundation saying we're

180
00:12:17,23 --> 00:12:19,76
advertising for the
festival director for 1973.

181
00:12:20,19 --> 00:12:22,11
We really like what you
wrote in the paper.

182
00:12:22,12 --> 00:12:27,04
Why don't you apply and i think
teaching was going really sour.

183
00:12:27,06 --> 00:12:29,72
And i put in an application.

184
00:12:29,74 --> 00:12:32,74
And was flown to melbourne and interviewed

185
00:12:32,74 --> 00:12:38,94
and at the time the australian union students
had invited ivan ellicott for a sort

186
00:12:38,94 --> 00:12:44,37
of a tour and i have an elec as a sort
of third world philosopher about.

187
00:12:44,39 --> 00:12:48,32
Going to say development in the
third world alternative options

188
00:12:48,32 --> 00:12:51,54
and particularly de
schooling and those kind of

189
00:12:51,54 --> 00:12:55,77
and i was sort of blown out by the ideas
that this man was coming up with and.

190
00:12:57,26 --> 00:12:59,40
It was after one of his talks that are.

191
00:12:59,42 --> 00:13:02,83
I heard from the interview on
committee that i got the job and

192
00:13:03,81 --> 00:13:07,24
that also they said we'd also interviewed
for another position the directors

193
00:13:07,24 --> 00:13:08,23
aquarius foundation

194
00:13:08,23 --> 00:13:10,91
and do you know a fellow called
john allen he's also from sydney.

195
00:13:11,06 --> 00:13:12,89
So it was like fight through us together.

196
00:13:13,36 --> 00:13:17,30
He was johnny on the ground dunstan
appointed to the only two positions in the

197
00:13:17,30 --> 00:13:21,87
aquarius foundation only to paid positions
to organise among other things the

198
00:13:21,87 --> 00:13:24,48
aquarius first of the 1973
so we had a blueprint.

199
00:13:24,95 --> 00:13:28,89
Already worked out and then we
had the job of putting together.

200
00:13:30,25 --> 00:13:31,84
There are two things
that were required for

201
00:13:31,84 --> 00:13:34,71
that one was to get the
message across to the people

202
00:13:34,71 --> 00:13:37,10
that they should come as tribes

203
00:13:37,10 --> 00:13:41,90
and bring something to present to
the festival not we had this thing

204
00:13:41,90 --> 00:13:44,67
that this is not a consumer festival
you have to make this festival.

205
00:13:44,74 --> 00:13:51,39
So if you got a particular thing you're
you're presenting like the alternative

206
00:13:51,39 --> 00:13:53,87
community telephone at that
time was hot in sydney

207
00:13:55,14 --> 00:13:59,94
and it was like an information center.
Service run by stephen wall and and.

208
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:05,15
And horan walker. I forget the horror
and horror and but adelle horror.

209
00:14:06,47 --> 00:14:09,66
And we asked them to help
us publicize the festival

210
00:14:09,66 --> 00:14:14,69
but also bring up their ideas
about community and the festival

211
00:14:14,69 --> 00:14:16,49
and bring their ideas about communications

212
00:14:16,49 --> 00:14:21,00
and so they did eventually they were very
helpful distributing information about

213
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:23,30
the festival and they came as a big tribe.

214
00:14:23,39 --> 00:14:26,95
Festival and also another
example would be.

215
00:14:26,97 --> 00:14:31,52
The feeble foundry gravel street paran.

216
00:14:31,54 --> 00:14:33,53
Sort of a whole wholemeal bakery

217
00:14:33,53 --> 00:14:37,15
that developed the it was also kind
of the community center and tribe

218
00:14:37,97 --> 00:14:39,71
and they agreed to come

219
00:14:39,71 --> 00:14:42,77
and not only come there bought
their bread making techniques

220
00:14:42,77 --> 00:14:46,52
and took over the neiman bakery and they
bake the bread for the festival and

221
00:14:46,52 --> 00:14:47,87
that was the kind of reach.

222
00:14:47,89 --> 00:14:49,90
We the message we wanted
to put out to people

223
00:14:51,32 --> 00:14:55,03
and the other issue was like
finding a site for the festival

224
00:14:55,03 --> 00:14:59,38
that wasn't a university campus
and wasn't in an urban center

225
00:14:59,38 --> 00:15:05,01
and place where people could camp
and reflect inward rather now.

226
00:15:06,03 --> 00:15:08,45
And that was my job to find a site.

227
00:15:08,99 --> 00:15:10,97
And we we reasoned

228
00:15:10,97 --> 00:15:17,48
that the southern states were too cold
queensland was too hostile politically

229
00:15:17,48 --> 00:15:23,34
and sort of the the northern rivers area
the north coast of new south wales seemed

230
00:15:23,34 --> 00:15:26,35
like the best bet. And it also
had a mythology going for it

231
00:15:26,35 --> 00:15:29,18
that we'd heard about this mythical place.

232
00:15:29,20 --> 00:15:33,62
Surfing paradise called byron bay
and there was something happening.

233
00:15:33,64 --> 00:15:35,10
Behind marlon bimby

234
00:15:35,80 --> 00:15:42,00
that were rumours of so we set up
set off to explore this area and.

235
00:15:42,71 --> 00:15:46,70
I advertised in the local papers for a
suitable simon kind of looking for you know

236
00:15:46,70 --> 00:15:48,99
300 acres or something.

237
00:15:49,19 --> 00:15:53,81
You know ideally countryside which might
become a community after which the

238
00:15:53,81 --> 00:15:59,92
festival would leave something substantial
after it. After we had it. And i had at.

239
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,12
No response.

240
00:16:01,37 --> 00:16:04,94
No one answered the ads and i travelled
round to go around real estate agents

241
00:16:04,94 --> 00:16:08,41
and i was getting exhausted
and consuming lots of petrol.

242
00:16:08,60 --> 00:16:11,98
Burning up lots of petrol driving around
the north coast looking at properties

243
00:16:13,22 --> 00:16:17,01
and we were running out of time
it was getting into november and

244
00:16:17,01 --> 00:16:23,39
that decision had to be in place for the
annual general meeting of the union in

245
00:16:23,40 --> 00:16:23,83
january

246
00:16:25,39 --> 00:16:31,30
and i was we had the support of cole james
from the arctic school at the university

247
00:16:31,30 --> 00:16:35,21
of sydney. And i spoke to col.

248
00:16:35,21 --> 00:16:37,62
Over the telephone long distance
saying i'm having no luck.

249
00:16:38,63 --> 00:16:41,33
And he said yes and we're
running out of time just call.

250
00:16:41,34 --> 00:16:46,38
Sort of offered to sort of do the site
design put his students onto designing the

251
00:16:46,38 --> 00:16:50,25
start of the festival and he said well maybe
we're looking in the wrong direction.

252
00:16:50,49 --> 00:16:53,15
Maybe we should be looking at
the town because if with this.

253
00:16:53,18 --> 00:16:56,33
Like that the cost of putting in the
infrastructure of roads and telephones

254
00:16:56,33 --> 00:16:58,42
and parallel kind of stuff
is going to be enormous

255
00:16:58,42 --> 00:17:02,49
and we don't really have it together so
we think about looking for a village

256
00:17:02,49 --> 00:17:04,78
that we can or something
that has a showground

257
00:17:04,78 --> 00:17:09,88
that we can place the stuff on i think i've
been driving through this place called

258
00:17:09,88 --> 00:17:15,07
niman which is really pretty and it's
got lots of empty shops and a hospital

259
00:17:15,07 --> 00:17:16,78
and looks pretty good.

260
00:17:18,73 --> 00:17:20,85
Sir i went and made enquiries

261
00:17:20,85 --> 00:17:24,57
and made contact with the show
society in the first port of call

262
00:17:24,57 --> 00:17:25,66
and they said we're interested

263
00:17:26,67 --> 00:17:31,71
and we had a meeting famous meeting
called james came up from sydney

264
00:17:33,40 --> 00:17:34,57
and.

265
00:17:34,59 --> 00:17:37,73
We we arranged the time to meet in member

266
00:17:37,73 --> 00:17:44,02
and executive the management committee of
the nimbin agriculture an industrial show

267
00:17:44,02 --> 00:17:48,90
society and i society the agricultural
and industrial society of nim

268
00:17:48,90 --> 00:17:52,08
that were collected around the
war memorial in the main street

269
00:17:52,08 --> 00:17:55,48
and we approached from the
south end of the main street

270
00:17:55,48 --> 00:17:59,68
and walked up the middle of the road and
met them in the middle of the high noon.

271
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:03,06
I mean we were able to do
those things at 5 p.m..

272
00:18:03,56 --> 00:18:08,92
In the afternoon in the images there's
very little traffic in the street and.

273
00:18:08,94 --> 00:18:13,87
And we went oh i think we would
have in the park back to them.

274
00:18:13,98 --> 00:18:17,74
The park behind woomera
and their position was

275
00:18:17,74 --> 00:18:21,67
that they were interested in the
idea of hosting a festival.

276
00:18:21,68 --> 00:18:23,98
And but i thought it was a major decision

277
00:18:23,98 --> 00:18:28,04
and the town should be involved
in decisions are it was agreed

278
00:18:28,04 --> 00:18:33,46
that we'd have a public meeting and so
we set the date book the home went away

279
00:18:33,46 --> 00:18:35,60
and we came back again
for the public meeting.

280
00:18:36,24 --> 00:18:38,13
That all the publicity we could were away

281
00:18:39,41 --> 00:18:45,88
and in i think it was november
like november and 1970 to.

282
00:18:46,95 --> 00:18:52,27
We had a public meeting we came from
all around the place we made it.

283
00:18:52,89 --> 00:18:55,94
A focal point for planning the festival

284
00:18:56,77 --> 00:19:01,54
and people came down from brisbane people
came across from armidale in sydney

285
00:19:02,37 --> 00:19:05,44
and we came early.

286
00:19:05,65 --> 00:19:11,28
I mean people from the the digger newspaper
in melbourne came up to watch it to see

287
00:19:11,28 --> 00:19:15,97
this public meeting and i'd
arrived a couple of days early.

288
00:19:17,72 --> 00:19:19,76
And spent.

289
00:19:21,18 --> 00:19:22,35
The day of the festival going around

290
00:19:22,35 --> 00:19:24,33
and distributing the
pamphlets about the meeting

291
00:19:24,33 --> 00:19:30,85
and talking to many people i could personally.
So that when we got a meeting about.

292
00:19:31,55 --> 00:19:36,73
Probably as i recall about 200
people in the town hall an emblem.

293
00:19:37,09 --> 00:19:39,03
And.

294
00:19:40,18 --> 00:19:43,88
And it was an extraordinary meeting basically
we'd attracted a lot of extraordinary

295
00:19:43,88 --> 00:19:49,64
people to come to the meeting for
example geico bomber paria who.

296
00:19:50,14 --> 00:19:50,46
At

297
00:19:50,46 --> 00:19:55,45
that time was organizing a group called
harpo which was a kind of the theatre group

298
00:19:55,45 --> 00:20:00,72
come. Consider organizing group
and hope. Food supplier.

299
00:20:01,62 --> 00:20:04,60
Associated with the university of
queensland they had the shop off the campus

300
00:20:04,60 --> 00:20:09,21
but they used to organise
their events on the campus.

301
00:20:09,23 --> 00:20:13,48
And though we approached them to see if
they'd been setting up a few cooperators

302
00:20:13,48 --> 00:20:14,03
part of the festival

303
00:20:15,64 --> 00:20:20,77
and bomb as an extraordinary guy an
extraordinary performer he went on to is a

304
00:20:20,77 --> 00:20:24,26
performer his own rival went
on to sort of produce the.

305
00:20:24,28 --> 00:20:28,98
Flying food fight circus albeit
with longer and he has great lawn.

306
00:20:29,06 --> 00:20:35,19
Pretty hair and sort of thick glasses
and a wry grin and he was there.

307
00:20:35,20 --> 00:20:37,88
Prancing around with a
plastic mallet right.

308
00:20:38,09 --> 00:20:41,08
So is in full performance and if
anyone showed any disaffection

309
00:20:41,08 --> 00:20:45,89
or grumpiness one would creep up behind
them and give them a bop on the head so

310
00:20:45,89 --> 00:20:51,75
that you know. Laughter was produced.
Happy also showed one of the 16 mm.

311
00:20:51,75 --> 00:20:52,10
Movies

312
00:20:52,10 --> 00:20:56,23
that they made which consisted of students
to these guys running around with toilet

313
00:20:56,23 --> 00:20:58,63
paper behind you know
streams of toilet paper.

314
00:20:58,92 --> 00:21:02,76
I don't see in the movie for a shameless
showing a solemn example of the kind of

315
00:21:02,76 --> 00:21:06,32
films with which i'm totally
incomprehensible myself don't know what name

316
00:21:06,32 --> 00:21:09,60
and people. But there was
just a feeling of goodwill

317
00:21:09,60 --> 00:21:11,53
that this was an exciting bunch of people

318
00:21:11,53 --> 00:21:14,96
and the music because we had
live music we perform for them.

319
00:21:15,05 --> 00:21:19,05
I was going to say that this was going to
be something special something different.

320
00:21:19,83 --> 00:21:22,12
So we had a tremendous
amount of goodwill generated

321
00:21:22,99 --> 00:21:25,72
and also we had the support of
the local policeman bob marsh.

322
00:21:27,02 --> 00:21:30,24
And bob marshall was a
policeman with a good heart

323
00:21:30,24 --> 00:21:36,83
and he was concerned about the economic
downturn at neiman the at the at the time

324
00:21:36,83 --> 00:21:40,44
of the festival the school the central
school was threatened with downgrading was

325
00:21:40,44 --> 00:21:44,09
going to become a primary school so even
the people in you know just the first two

326
00:21:44,09 --> 00:21:47,50
years of high school had to travel to
lismore they were talking about closing the

327
00:21:47,50 --> 00:21:51,40
hospital which you know the neiman
community had worked so hard to create

328
00:21:51,40 --> 00:21:52,59
and build in the first place.

329
00:21:54,58 --> 00:21:55,68
And so that the pensioners

330
00:21:55,68 --> 00:21:59,23
and they were people living the town would
have to travel to lismore the services.

331
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,54
And bob was a bit of an entrepreneur
he had on the side he had a.

332
00:22:04,73 --> 00:22:08,86
Sort of recycle pet food business used to
recycle the carcasses in the area dead

333
00:22:08,86 --> 00:22:13,88
cows and dead horses and he wanted to
see more enterprise develop in him

334
00:22:13,88 --> 00:22:16,66
and so he was when we say
well look you chris.

335
00:22:16,68 --> 00:22:18,17
Festival put this town on the map

336
00:22:18,17 --> 00:22:20,49
and you certainly get a lot
of young people moving back.

337
00:22:20,51 --> 00:22:23,82
He was like totally supportive
you know do you think

338
00:22:23,83 --> 00:22:26,17
that helped regenerate nimbin
he was going to support.

339
00:22:26,35 --> 00:22:28,50
So he didn't attend the meeting
but he wrote a letter.

340
00:22:28,59 --> 00:22:32,92
You know to the festival to the
meeting which was read aloud

341
00:22:32,92 --> 00:22:38,98
and it was had the great impact the
impact it had on bob marsh's career as a

342
00:22:38,98 --> 00:22:42,58
policeman was also it's a very good kind
of drummed out of the police force with

343
00:22:42,58 --> 00:22:45,69
being so outspoken. And support.

344
00:22:47,07 --> 00:22:52,93
And the big question was asked of course
inevitably what about drugs and. We.

345
00:22:52,96 --> 00:22:54,42
I remember saying at the time

346
00:22:54,42 --> 00:22:57,44
that the aquarius festival was
not a sunday school picnic.

347
00:22:57,82 --> 00:23:02,24
We're talking about university
students here and. And that marijuana.

348
00:23:02,54 --> 00:23:06,27
Lucia gins were part of the culture
and there's no way we could prevent

349
00:23:06,27 --> 00:23:11,58
that being present at the
festival. And the vote was taken.

350
00:23:11,91 --> 00:23:15,85
It was you know it was like almost unanimous
there only a handful of people i would

351
00:23:15,85 --> 00:23:19,51
say no more than six people who
voted against having the festival.

352
00:23:20,34 --> 00:23:26,10
So we were triumphant. In
fact back down south to the.

353
00:23:26,86 --> 00:23:31,09
To the meeting the annual meeting of the
australian union students and our job.

354
00:23:31,44 --> 00:23:34,37
Was then to get the money for the
budget. You know to get a budget.

355
00:23:34,92 --> 00:23:38,27
As a major event for the student finances.

356
00:23:39,31 --> 00:23:42,96
Well that was the most amazing event
in itself is going to mention

357
00:23:44,14 --> 00:23:49,02
that there are lots of demands lots being
put on the budget of the australian union

358
00:23:49,02 --> 00:23:52,82
of students and.

359
00:23:53,90 --> 00:23:57,63
We worked out that we brought our
entertainers in our singers and dancers

360
00:23:57,63 --> 00:24:00,99
and like our staff when we did them
i spect. Macular presentation.

361
00:24:01,13 --> 00:24:05,86
I remember i wore a dress.

362
00:24:05,88 --> 00:24:12,01
And sparklers i've met people since you
know. The late 80s working in melbourne.

363
00:24:12,24 --> 00:24:16,40
I met a guy in an advertising agency all
your grandsons and i remember i was

364
00:24:16,40 --> 00:24:21,73
that sort of you know wet behind the ears
student politician were going to my first

365
00:24:21,73 --> 00:24:25,38
australian union students conference
and you did this amazing presentation.

366
00:24:25,54 --> 00:24:28,29
It's the best presentation
of ever seen up always well

367
00:24:28,29 --> 00:24:31,66
when i do presentations my clients
are always trying to emulate.

368
00:24:32,48 --> 00:24:36,50
The flair impulse theres a representation.
Anyway what happened was that.

369
00:24:37,77 --> 00:24:41,41
We knock their socks off. Basically and
we had total support for the festival

370
00:24:41,41 --> 00:24:45,92
and we had got through with an open ended
budget over who we had something like

371
00:24:45,92 --> 00:24:50,54
twenty thousand dollars in 1973
money to produce this money

372
00:24:50,54 --> 00:24:51,76
but basic it was open ended.

373
00:24:51,84 --> 00:24:55,52
We could do whatever we needed to do to
get this festival happening which we went

374
00:24:55,52 --> 00:24:57,51
away and did.

375
00:24:58,57 --> 00:25:02,87
So having got the money.

376
00:25:02,89 --> 00:25:08,86
The responsibilities were again split
johnny allen did the spruiking here he was

377
00:25:08,86 --> 00:25:11,72
took the job on of going round
australia talking up the festival

378
00:25:12,48 --> 00:25:15,92
and i had the job of sort of getting
the site organised in nimbin.

379
00:25:15,94 --> 00:25:22,00
And sort of preparing the town for the
strategy we adopted for the publicity was to

380
00:25:22,00 --> 00:25:25,28
work through the student papers and.

381
00:25:26,16 --> 00:25:30,37
We got each with the student papers
at the major campuses to give us

382
00:25:30,37 --> 00:25:34,60
and in addition of the paper which
was the principal i used in 71

383
00:25:35,44 --> 00:25:37,24
and have a guest editor in and.

384
00:25:38,70 --> 00:25:44,47
We filled the paper with stories about
people who are coming to the festival people

385
00:25:44,47 --> 00:25:47,24
giving their raves about
the future. So we had.

386
00:25:47,25 --> 00:25:53,54
Coal james talking about alternative
architecture and low low energy houses

387
00:25:53,54 --> 00:25:59,42
and it was kind of stuff and organic
gardening. You know. So it was.

388
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,01
Always a fascinating array of ideas being
presented. And because we never ever.

389
00:26:05,16 --> 00:26:09,14
We had we had posters funded by
the peter stuyvesant foundation.

390
00:26:09,82 --> 00:26:11,39
It's a bit of an irony at the time.

391
00:26:12,80 --> 00:26:16,03
They never founded the eucharist foundation
again after they found out what the

392
00:26:16,03 --> 00:26:17,79
festivals about.

393
00:26:17,81 --> 00:26:22,42
But basically we didn't use any of the
established many we didn't advertise in them

394
00:26:22,42 --> 00:26:28,27
in the media that television
radio or the press.

395
00:26:28,98 --> 00:26:33,09
And it was only as a very successful
campaign we said you know publicity

396
00:26:33,09 --> 00:26:36,32
that the word of the festival would be
carried on the lips of the counterculture

397
00:26:36,32 --> 00:26:38,88
the people who are really interested in
the light is would tell their friends

398
00:26:38,88 --> 00:26:44,04
and they get together to come and i
remember people scoffing about this

399
00:26:44,04 --> 00:26:47,95
and there is a danger because people carry
negative messages much more readily in

400
00:26:47,95 --> 00:26:49,06
that there is a positive one.

401
00:26:49,14 --> 00:26:51,48
So you got to keep the
vibe really really high

402
00:26:51,48 --> 00:26:54,64
but it was only about three
weeks before the festival

403
00:26:54,64 --> 00:26:59,15
when the first articles appeared in the
sydney morning herald acknowledging

404
00:26:59,15 --> 00:27:02,53
that something strange was happening and
something extraordinary is happening like.

405
00:27:02,75 --> 00:27:07,74
You know the word is out the name of the
place to go to so is a very successful

406
00:27:07,74 --> 00:27:14,30
campaign to court the established
press unawares. And johnny allen.

407
00:27:14,59 --> 00:27:17,81
Was going around australia.
Talking these things up.

408
00:27:17,83 --> 00:27:19,19
He was assisted by a theatre group

409
00:27:19,19 --> 00:27:24,21
that he put together called the white
company which did the same thing in song

410
00:27:24,21 --> 00:27:30,75
and dance and would sing anthems and
create the mood. So we used to.

411
00:27:32,33 --> 00:27:38,40
When the sessions we always finish with
the ritual we burn some incense. Sort of.

412
00:27:38,77 --> 00:27:42,88
Essential oils on charcoal.
Can you know it's.

413
00:27:42,94 --> 00:27:45,44
If you're dealing with
the sort of big temple.

414
00:27:45,71 --> 00:27:51,70
You know it sort of feels there was a breeze
a ball amount of incense who i mean we

415
00:27:51,70 --> 00:27:57,18
deal in melbourne and john pindar. Jump
in the from the last laugh. Come along.

416
00:27:58,49 --> 00:27:59,95
It's got to be on the control.

417
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:09,49
We actually had to leave
the house below ensign.

418
00:28:09,50 --> 00:28:14,57
And the other thing got out of control was
what company or totally inspirational

419
00:28:14,57 --> 00:28:19,68
but they were all all had their individual
performance troops there a lot of egos

420
00:28:19,68 --> 00:28:21,61
begin sort of bouncing.

421
00:28:21,63 --> 00:28:25,90
Of each other and towards the
end of the tour they got more

422
00:28:25,90 --> 00:28:30,99
and more interested in
primal scream therapy.

423
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:35,67
The object of the exercise was to invite
the people feeling of the festival

424
00:28:36,95 --> 00:28:41,41
and towards the end of the what companies
promotion the feeling of the festival was

425
00:28:41,41 --> 00:28:48,01
this one's primal scream that for who
exactly is going around school raining.

426
00:28:48,03 --> 00:28:51,50
I had my doubts about whether the
first two promotion at the end

427
00:28:51,50 --> 00:28:57,33
but we got there in the white
company were fantastic. So.

428
00:28:57,34 --> 00:29:01,81
Meanwhile back in nimbin the word got out

429
00:29:02,59 --> 00:29:06,64
and we started up a suit kitchen
which we called the rainbow cafe

430
00:29:07,55 --> 00:29:11,77
and we offered any one who
couldn't afford to pay for people.

431
00:29:11,85 --> 00:29:15,28
Anyone who wanted to work on the
preparation the festival came along

432
00:29:15,28 --> 00:29:17,71
and we would see them
exchange their labour

433
00:29:19,12 --> 00:29:23,93
and in the beginning this
worked wonderfully. And.

434
00:29:24,87 --> 00:29:28,14
Yes we reprinted some some
money in cool name and breads

435
00:29:28,14 --> 00:29:33,72
and an exchange has the name and bread.
If you work the first name and bread.

436
00:29:34,25 --> 00:29:40,79
It gets your food at night and the rain
by cafe itself every evening was like.

437
00:29:41,72 --> 00:29:43,37
A wonderland in a time

438
00:29:43,37 --> 00:29:48,09
when i would sit around with you know
who sat on the floor and low tables.

439
00:29:50,52 --> 00:29:52,97
One of the early countercultural
impacts on a man was

440
00:29:52,97 --> 00:29:59,77
that we say we savage tables we simply can't
a table. We cut its legs of. The fact.

441
00:30:01,36 --> 00:30:04,44
But. We sit on the floor
and we read together

442
00:30:04,44 --> 00:30:07,57
and then we have a talk about the progress
and the festival and then we'd sing

443
00:30:07,57 --> 00:30:11,68
and every night you know there'd be a new
group of people arriving in town these

444
00:30:11,68 --> 00:30:14,95
triple doors and we would be blown
out by the latest performance or

445
00:30:14,95 --> 00:30:17,04
that the latest rave that people come

446
00:30:17,04 --> 00:30:21,67
and say they want to do it was a magical
place in the reputation of the rainbow a

447
00:30:21,67 --> 00:30:27,60
cafe is sort of the cafe of the
universe was sort of built in this.

448
00:30:27,62 --> 00:30:31,48
And what happened for me as an
organizer was this was wonderful p.r.

449
00:30:31,48 --> 00:30:36,88
For the local nimbin community and we
used to invite local businesspeople

450
00:30:36,88 --> 00:30:38,65
and residents.

451
00:30:38,67 --> 00:30:39,95
To come and dine with us

452
00:30:39,95 --> 00:30:44,51
and because they would be blown out to just
it is we finished with a dance everyone

453
00:30:44,51 --> 00:30:49,87
dancing together and holding hands was
canister and wonderful uplifting.

454
00:30:50,13 --> 00:30:53,90
Spiritual experiences and they would
go back and tell their friends

455
00:30:53,90 --> 00:30:54,55
and neighbors

456
00:30:54,55 --> 00:30:59,48
and we had extraordinary goodwill in the
beginning was like magic on the streets

457
00:31:00,87 --> 00:31:03,57
there was a woman who arrived in the
village called margaret sullivan.

458
00:31:04,93 --> 00:31:09,02
Margaret was an irish singer
touring australia at the time

459
00:31:09,02 --> 00:31:12,25
and she was going north and
she decide to detour via name

460
00:31:12,25 --> 00:31:15,21
and because you'd heard about this
place and. Hopped out of the car.

461
00:31:15,77 --> 00:31:21,32
And stayed for seven years.
And she became a welcome.

462
00:31:21,67 --> 00:31:24,74
So that any new face that
arrived in town was. You know.

463
00:31:25,26 --> 00:31:28,36
Margaret go and introduce them and
find a place for most kind of stuff

464
00:31:28,36 --> 00:31:31,50
and she was also a
liaison officer she'd go

465
00:31:31,50 --> 00:31:38,99
and talk to the residents
to find out their concerns.
