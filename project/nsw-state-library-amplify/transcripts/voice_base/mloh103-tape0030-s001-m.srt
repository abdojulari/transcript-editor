1
00:00:16,24 --> 00:00:21,84
Like i hope i do and i saw them
alive in on her and were in charge.

2
00:00:21,85 --> 00:00:22,52
Working too

3
00:00:22,52 --> 00:00:29,48
and you know i'm interested
to hear you know.

4
00:00:30,06 --> 00:00:34,25
Who. And she's so good.

5
00:00:34,52 --> 00:00:39,37
Well i came to this area
about 14 years ago.

6
00:00:39,39 --> 00:00:41,21
My name's katrina shields

7
00:00:41,21 --> 00:00:47,79
and i came to this area 14 years ago
originally to live on a community called body

8
00:00:47,79 --> 00:00:52,42
farm that had about 20
adults and 15 children.

9
00:00:52,44 --> 00:00:58,62
That time and i had been living
on another community in victoria.

10
00:00:58,89 --> 00:01:03,80
That i joined after coming back
from india had lived in the east

11
00:01:03,80 --> 00:01:07,48
and particularly india and
nepal for a couple of years

12
00:01:08,34 --> 00:01:12,60
and i knew i didn't want
to go back to being.

13
00:01:12,61 --> 00:01:16,82
An occupational therapist and.

14
00:01:16,83 --> 00:01:19,81
Working as a professional
in the mainstream.

15
00:01:20,37 --> 00:01:22,76
So i guess i chose to drop right out

16
00:01:23,50 --> 00:01:26,59
but i was very much attracted to
what was happening in this area

17
00:01:27,57 --> 00:01:30,32
and on hearing about
body farm i came up here

18
00:01:30,32 --> 00:01:35,93
and originally to do a month long
meditation retreat and i stayed

19
00:01:36,64 --> 00:01:40,69
and joined body farm and lived
there for four and a half years

20
00:01:41,40 --> 00:01:46,61
and still part of that community and but
have since moved to the village nearby

21
00:01:47,50 --> 00:01:52,40
and come and gone over
that time. Work to do so.

22
00:01:53,89 --> 00:01:59,64
Richly i was drawn to
the ethical structure.

23
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:02,78
At the i was strongly in for influenced

24
00:02:02,78 --> 00:02:07,62
and interested in buddhist meditation
practice and had been involved in

25
00:02:07,62 --> 00:02:13,54
that very strongly in india and knew i
wanted to live a rural community life

26
00:02:14,39 --> 00:02:15,75
but the community.

27
00:02:15,76 --> 00:02:21,11
I was on had a very loose structure
and wasn't really working for me and

28
00:02:21,11 --> 00:02:24,99
when i met these people i guess i was really
struck by their spirit you know there

29
00:02:24,99 --> 00:02:26,35
was just something.

30
00:02:27,34 --> 00:02:31,92
That they had going as a group particularly
the men the way they were together they

31
00:02:31,92 --> 00:02:35,80
were really soft and open and
sharing that was the initial thing

32
00:02:35,80 --> 00:02:39,93
that attracted me and then they told me
about the structure of the community

33
00:02:39,93 --> 00:02:44,70
and the fact that the five buddhist
precepts were the basis of the community

34
00:02:44,70 --> 00:02:50,45
and that just instantly struck a chord
with me and i wanted to go and find out.

35
00:02:50,66 --> 00:02:54,94
And as soon as i walked in i just had this
really strong feeling this is my place.

36
00:02:54,99 --> 00:03:00,00
You know i'm and it and
i just fell into place.

37
00:03:00,30 --> 00:03:02,71
It is and i was very happy being there

38
00:03:02,71 --> 00:03:05,37
and i still feel very strongly
connected to that group

39
00:03:06,09 --> 00:03:09,00
and feel like they're my kin.

40
00:03:09,02 --> 00:03:13,83
Although i have a large
extended family in melbourne.

41
00:03:13,85 --> 00:03:19,11
These people and if the
word kin seems to cover.

42
00:03:19,66 --> 00:03:23,70
How i feel you know we don't
always like each other but

43
00:03:24,57 --> 00:03:28,58
but there's a strong commitment to each
other and we know heaps about each other

44
00:03:28,58 --> 00:03:33,74
and. Yeah we're just we're you
know sort of sticking together.

45
00:03:34,86 --> 00:03:36,64
Yeah.

46
00:03:38,39 --> 00:03:44,26
Yeah was very much motivated
initially by bein in a search.

47
00:03:44,28 --> 00:03:46,79
Again.

48
00:03:46,81 --> 00:03:52,92
Initially i was motivated by an
inner sort of spiritual inquiry.

49
00:03:52,93 --> 00:03:58,77
And personal growth that's what nisha lee
drew me of wanting to discover more about

50
00:03:58,77 --> 00:03:59,10
myself.

51
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,87
How to grow as a person how to overcome
my own hang ups how to extend myself

52
00:04:05,87 --> 00:04:09,86
and so i was very attracted to
all sorts of personal growth.

53
00:04:11,19 --> 00:04:15,15
Stuff and also learning how to
build and grow organic vegetables

54
00:04:15,15 --> 00:04:16,47
and make mud bricks

55
00:04:16,47 --> 00:04:21,71
and you know live very simply
because i've been i lived in india

56
00:04:21,71 --> 00:04:25,30
and saw how they lived there and
it really touched me very deeply

57
00:04:25,30 --> 00:04:27,62
that i just couldn't go on consuming

58
00:04:27,62 --> 00:04:32,44
and having as much as i saw around me
i see that we couldn't sustain that.

59
00:04:32,51 --> 00:04:37,41
So i was very attracted to
living very simply and then

60
00:04:37,42 --> 00:04:41,51
that sort of grew from there
that i after a number of years.

61
00:04:41,67 --> 00:04:44,07
I felt drawn back into the mainstream

62
00:04:44,97 --> 00:04:50,16
that i wanted to to make bridges
back in to a wider society

63
00:04:51,05 --> 00:04:56,03
that somehow wasn't i wasn't personally
being nourished enough by the isolation of

64
00:04:56,03 --> 00:05:00,63
the community but also i
wanted to be stretched.

65
00:05:01,05 --> 00:05:07,77
I actually stepped out by setting out
setting up a small business in lismore a

66
00:05:07,78 --> 00:05:09,67
health food business.

67
00:05:10,88 --> 00:05:14,59
But then i was also offered locums
back doing occupational therapy

68
00:05:14,59 --> 00:05:17,98
and health promotion which is what
i'd done before. So it drew me back.

69
00:05:19,55 --> 00:05:21,36
So i wanted to spend the two worlds

70
00:05:21,36 --> 00:05:27,40
and say ok we did experiment with weather
alternatives wouldn't learnt a lot in the

71
00:05:27,40 --> 00:05:30,07
process. How can we use

72
00:05:30,08 --> 00:05:34,35
that to sort of nourish what was
happening in the mainstream you know

73
00:05:34,35 --> 00:05:39,42
and bring really good things about the
mainstream back into alternative society.

74
00:05:39,54 --> 00:05:42,49
You know hell with things about
time management and being efficient

75
00:05:42,49 --> 00:05:44,99
and getting things done and
really making things happen

76
00:05:45,93 --> 00:05:49,00
that i want to also bring back
into alternative society.

77
00:05:49,14 --> 00:05:49,56
You know that

78
00:05:49,56 --> 00:05:53,67
that it wasn't all about you know just
lazing around having a good time.

79
00:05:53,70 --> 00:05:59,92
Although actually we worked really
hard. It's not true that we set.

80
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,25
Around under trees contemplating our
navels i think i think i probably worked

81
00:06:04,25 --> 00:06:08,85
harder in those days you
know 16 hour days hell.

82
00:06:09,44 --> 00:06:13,09
It was making mud bricks
or working in the garden.

83
00:06:13,11 --> 00:06:18,06
So sometimes were actually workaholic
about what we did but we had a good time.

84
00:06:21,27 --> 00:06:25,89
With those you know. Quite strict.

85
00:06:26,09 --> 00:06:26,71
Yeah

86
00:06:26,71 --> 00:06:32,12
and i was probably amongst the strict you know
i was really on about being ideologically

87
00:06:32,12 --> 00:06:35,16
sound and you know everybody
should work really hard and

88
00:06:35,16 --> 00:06:38,88
and you couldn't have anything
but organic vegetables

89
00:06:38,88 --> 00:06:43,47
and you know alcohol was very taboo
and cigarettes were outrageous

90
00:06:43,47 --> 00:06:50,15
and you know cars were morally unsound
either if i was pretty strict

91
00:06:50,15 --> 00:06:54,98
and i guess a lot of us were we were very
idealistic you know we really wanted to

92
00:06:55,83 --> 00:07:00,71
be sound about what we were doing and
we didn't want to be on the dole so

93
00:07:00,71 --> 00:07:03,58
that meant living on the
smell of an oil he wreck

94
00:07:05,22 --> 00:07:08,22
and getting by very little because we
didn't have many sources of income.

95
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:15,62
So yeah i think we're pretty
hard line of softened up a lot.

96
00:07:15,64 --> 00:07:18,17
You know i don't think it
was bad to be like that

97
00:07:18,17 --> 00:07:21,18
but i don't know if it was so sustainable.

98
00:07:22,16 --> 00:07:27,68
So what the hell those that work.

99
00:07:27,70 --> 00:07:30,75
I i moved back into the mainstream

100
00:07:30,75 --> 00:07:36,68
and now working part time as a councillor
in a women's health centre focusing

101
00:07:36,69 --> 00:07:38,56
particularly on older women.

102
00:07:38,58 --> 00:07:43,65
But i also do training and development
work with community groups run workshops

103
00:07:43,65 --> 00:07:44,96
and trainings

104
00:07:44,96 --> 00:07:50,81
and conflict resolution working
together anti burnout strategies

105
00:07:51,70 --> 00:07:55,67
and team building things like that.

106
00:07:57,86 --> 00:08:01,14
In the book a manual about. First much.

107
00:08:01,38 --> 00:08:05,64
Yeah yeah well the book grew out of this.

108
00:08:05,66 --> 00:08:10,45
I ended up writing a book which
was a synthesis of the ideas

109
00:08:10,45 --> 00:08:14,57
and the experiments wed had
and learning from each other

110
00:08:14,57 --> 00:08:19,11
and living in community in being involved
in social change campaigns fighting for

111
00:08:19,11 --> 00:08:23,68
the rainforests working
on peace issues and also.

112
00:08:23,70 --> 00:08:31,85
Synthesizing the personal growth
to the counseling the creativity.

113
00:08:31,87 --> 00:08:37,37
And. Learning how to be effective
in social change work.

114
00:08:37,81 --> 00:08:41,41
And bringing a more heart politics
approach into what we did.

115
00:08:42,05 --> 00:08:46,40
So this this turned into a menu
of all those different aspects.

116
00:08:46,90 --> 00:08:52,65
With exercises that i and
others had used to grow

117
00:08:52,65 --> 00:08:56,30
and to work together in groups.

118
00:08:57,40 --> 00:09:02,15
And so of help is i mean.

119
00:09:02,17 --> 00:09:06,93
Well the term politics was originally
coined by a woman called brand peavey who

120
00:09:06,93 --> 00:09:07,97
happened to be american.

121
00:09:09,78 --> 00:09:14,66
And yes it means bringing together that
which is normally seen as a separate

122
00:09:14,66 --> 00:09:20,79
but the heart. They are most
vulnerable part our loving caring.

123
00:09:20,81 --> 00:09:25,78
And innermost being bringing
that together with.

124
00:09:25,79 --> 00:09:29,44
Influencing social change. Having power.

125
00:09:30,21 --> 00:09:32,96
The structures that bring about.

126
00:09:32,97 --> 00:09:38,97
Movement in society and we often see
hat as being incredibly separate from

127
00:09:38,97 --> 00:09:44,47
that that. A lot of the
models of power and of.

128
00:09:44,49 --> 00:09:49,01
Social change seen as you know
corrupt just out these so.

129
00:09:49,43 --> 00:09:51,62
Wielding power not caring
about the consequences

130
00:09:52,84 --> 00:09:59,80
that any means justify the ends and all
of us felt pretty disgusted by that.

131
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:03,08
And very unattracted to that
way of bringing about change.

132
00:10:03,68 --> 00:10:08,52
So we've been experimenting with a whole
lot of different ways to bring the two

133
00:10:08,52 --> 00:10:10,80
together. What what does a personal growth

134
00:10:11,50 --> 00:10:16,01
and spiritual movement have to do
with gnashing political action

135
00:10:16,01 --> 00:10:20,48
and sustaining political action and
drawing people in who feel powerless

136
00:10:20,48 --> 00:10:23,17
and uninvolved.

137
00:10:24,10 --> 00:10:28,80
We originally got attracted to this.

138
00:10:28,82 --> 00:10:30,59
During the early 80s

139
00:10:30,59 --> 00:10:34,93
when many of us felt incredible
despair about the nuclear issue

140
00:10:35,99 --> 00:10:41,77
that we had heaps of information about what
was likely to happen what could happen

141
00:10:41,77 --> 00:10:45,43
what was happening and it
was pretty hard to respond.

142
00:10:45,49 --> 00:10:51,15
The threat was so huge and you
know i felt sick and overwhelmed

143
00:10:51,15 --> 00:10:51,88
and depressed

144
00:10:52,61 --> 00:10:59,24
and we came across some methods for
transforming those feelings into effective

145
00:10:59,24 --> 00:11:05,72
action and that was to actually grieve
to validate our despair and to recognise

146
00:11:05,72 --> 00:11:11,62
that our responses were really a sane
reaction to an insane situation and

147
00:11:11,62 --> 00:11:16,91
that perhaps no other generation had had
to face up squarely to the fact of its own

148
00:11:16,91 --> 00:11:17,18
extinction

149
00:11:18,05 --> 00:11:22,12
that many of us grew up feeling like there
just wasn't a future whether it was an

150
00:11:22,12 --> 00:11:27,23
alternative future or whether it was the
one mapped out to it. By the mainstream.

151
00:11:28,39 --> 00:11:32,67
So that's a pretty hard thing to give up
the feeling like what's the use of having

152
00:11:32,67 --> 00:11:35,43
children. Were you know
if we do have children.

153
00:11:35,57 --> 00:11:39,57
What are we bringing them into so we
were facing pretty strong despair

154
00:11:40,27 --> 00:11:44,52
and so we experimented with
methods for working with grief.

155
00:11:44,84 --> 00:11:47,32
Ritual work.

156
00:11:47,34 --> 00:11:50,94
Support groups to bring that
out and what we found was

157
00:11:50,94 --> 00:11:54,21
that by going quite deeply into
that despair that and hopelessness

158
00:11:54,21 --> 00:11:58,36
that we felt it actually liberated
a lot of energy and hope

159
00:11:58,36 --> 00:11:59,66
that was the amazing thing.

160
00:12:01,47 --> 00:12:03,76
That the more we acknowledge

161
00:12:03,76 --> 00:12:08,79
that fully the more passion
for life came through and

162
00:12:08,79 --> 00:12:14,44
that actually we were connecting deeper
sources of energy and realizing that

163
00:12:14,44 --> 00:12:15,83
that pain came from.

164
00:12:17,63 --> 00:12:22,32
A a feeling and a knowing of our
interconnectedness we hurt because we cared.

165
00:12:23,23 --> 00:12:26,21
We hurt because we were part of
life and life was threatened.

166
00:12:26,70 --> 00:12:28,91
We weren't personally
necessarily threatened

167
00:12:28,91 --> 00:12:33,90
but we could see what was happening to
other species and what might happen.

168
00:12:34,11 --> 00:12:38,09
And so it was by validating that
interconnection that the more power

169
00:12:38,09 --> 00:12:42,13
and sense of being able
to affect change grew.

170
00:12:42,41 --> 00:12:46,62
But then we also needed to learn skills you
know how do you organize how do you run

171
00:12:46,62 --> 00:12:49,85
groups how do you conduct
meetings how do you get rallies

172
00:12:49,85 --> 00:12:53,02
that really get people along.
How can we have fun doing this.

173
00:12:53,25 --> 00:12:57,15
We are only doing it for the rest of our
life you know so we really want to enjoy

174
00:12:57,15 --> 00:13:02,19
it and so a lot of what we'd
learnt in living in community

175
00:13:02,19 --> 00:13:06,89
and working on social campaigns you know
brought back together with this emotional

176
00:13:06,89 --> 00:13:11,62
and spiritual work.

177
00:13:13,68 --> 00:13:15,96
Yeah yeah that.

178
00:13:16,71 --> 00:13:20,36
I think so we're trying to make
something positive out of something

179
00:13:20,37 --> 00:13:23,60
that was very negative like
a threat to the future.

180
00:13:23,83 --> 00:13:29,00
The possible loss completely of our
future or at least all this beauty

181
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:32,26
and this environment that
we could see around us.

182
00:13:32,40 --> 00:13:37,15
The extinction of species pollution
of the air and water have a turn

183
00:13:37,15 --> 00:13:42,36
that into a source for also celebration

184
00:13:43,25 --> 00:13:44,55
and.

185
00:13:44,57 --> 00:13:49,68
Drawing on inner resources in
ourselves and each other and see

186
00:13:49,68 --> 00:13:52,49
that yet as a cause for celebration.

187
00:13:53,19 --> 00:13:59,93
That you know there's much to do and
that can be done joyfully. And how.

188
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:03,07
Fully effectively because it's not
just about having a good time.

189
00:14:03,09 --> 00:14:05,09
We also want to make effective change

190
00:14:05,09 --> 00:14:11,16
and that's that's an ongoing challenge
to me but a lot of these people

191
00:14:11,16 --> 00:14:14,94
that are very left brain and
like we've got no time for fun

192
00:14:14,94 --> 00:14:16,82
and you know we've got no time to sit down

193
00:14:16,82 --> 00:14:21,00
and work on our relationships because the
campaign you know there's this campaign

194
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:24,54
and there's this meeting and
hell is this deadline like that.

195
00:14:24,58 --> 00:14:25,95
That's no more effective.

196
00:14:26,06 --> 00:14:30,39
You know so really facing up to the
fact that if you burn people out

197
00:14:30,39 --> 00:14:32,68
and you have such a lousy time.

198
00:14:32,90 --> 00:14:37,97
It doesn't work you know it's you're
not building a social change movement.

199
00:14:38,48 --> 00:14:39,49
So it seemed

200
00:14:39,49 --> 00:14:43,99
that building movements for change really
needed something much more integrated

201
00:14:44,93 --> 00:14:48,42
that meant we knew how to live together
we knew how to resolve conflicts.

202
00:14:48,49 --> 00:14:55,04
When you had to support each other we
knew had or were effectively do meetings.

203
00:14:55,21 --> 00:14:58,62
You know stick to agendas plan campaigns

204
00:14:58,63 --> 00:15:02,32
and a lot of the lessons of
community came out of that

205
00:15:02,32 --> 00:15:05,37
that if you can live together
and bring two children together

206
00:15:05,37 --> 00:15:06,56
and solve your conflicts.

207
00:15:06,80 --> 00:15:09,10
You've got great resources
for then going out

208
00:15:09,10 --> 00:15:10,84
and changing what's happening in your town

209
00:15:11,64 --> 00:15:15,69
or changing what's happening
much wider than your town.

210
00:15:15,71 --> 00:15:25,42
The heart of.

211
00:15:26,37 --> 00:15:31,41
Well perhaps the heart politics
is whether it was. Feminine.

212
00:15:31,52 --> 00:15:34,77
I actually see it as an
integration of the masculine

213
00:15:34,77 --> 00:15:40,01
and the feminine principle if you like
if you see traditionally the feminine

214
00:15:40,01 --> 00:15:43,98
principle as been about you know caring
and heart and nurturing and nurturing

215
00:15:45,07 --> 00:15:49,29
and the masculine principle about being
you know organized and effective

216
00:15:49,29 --> 00:15:54,88
and upfront and leadership
and exercising power.

217
00:15:56,25 --> 00:15:59,87
I see that happen. Bringing
those two together their boss.

218
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,33
Necessary all heart you
know might feel good

219
00:16:04,33 --> 00:16:07,38
but it's not going to bring about change.

220
00:16:07,40 --> 00:16:12,21
Necessarily and all all
head isn't going to last

221
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:14,45
and people want to be part of it.

222
00:16:14,53 --> 00:16:19,82
So i see how politics is bringing the
head and the heart you know the spirit

223
00:16:19,82 --> 00:16:21,08
and the body.

224
00:16:21,09 --> 00:16:25,08
The masculine and feminine together
to turn our she each other

225
00:16:26,01 --> 00:16:30,29
and hopefully have the best
of both. Yeah you know.

226
00:16:30,92 --> 00:16:36,67
The. Way you. Change.

227
00:16:36,84 --> 00:16:38,08
You know.

228
00:16:38,09 --> 00:16:44,94
Oh very extreme ways.

229
00:16:44,96 --> 00:16:47,80
So what some of the extremes
we went to in the early days.

230
00:16:48,15 --> 00:16:50,27
Well there was the extreme hard line

231
00:16:50,27 --> 00:16:57,02
and i know i was one of those really
trying to stick very rigidly to ideology

232
00:16:57,02 --> 00:17:00,57
and eschew anything from the mainstream

233
00:17:00,57 --> 00:17:04,46
that might be you know
tainting our alternatives.

234
00:17:04,96 --> 00:17:11,21
But i guess we're pretty extreme about you
know things like experimenting with bio

235
00:17:11,21 --> 00:17:12,41
energetic there p.

236
00:17:12,66 --> 00:17:17,73
You know big cathartic releases
and and you know nudity

237
00:17:17,73 --> 00:17:24,45
and. Things like that and you
know i look back and chuckle.

238
00:17:24,70 --> 00:17:29,24
Now at some of those things
some of the naivete.

239
00:17:29,52 --> 00:17:32,11
Perhaps that we approached things

240
00:17:32,11 --> 00:17:35,87
and i was thinking about you
know i set up a small business

241
00:17:35,87 --> 00:17:41,27
and in selling health foods and i
think credibly naive about business.

242
00:17:42,66 --> 00:17:46,04
I went in thinking i was just doing
it because it was doing good.

243
00:17:46,19 --> 00:17:49,01
It never occurred to me that would make
money or that it should make money.

244
00:17:49,21 --> 00:17:53,71
You know i just didn't think like it
was just what's good for the group.

245
00:17:53,72 --> 00:17:59,09
Now i think i'd stop and say well it was
going to make it because that matters. So.

246
00:18:02,69 --> 00:18:07,10
I don't know what other extremes
perhaps extremes of sort of poverty.

247
00:18:07,12 --> 00:18:13,38
That we're subjected ourselves to mean i
lived for quite a long time in a tent in

248
00:18:13,38 --> 00:18:18,07
the rainforest and then graduated
onto sheds without wall.

249
00:18:19,47 --> 00:18:22,52
Amongst the leeches and the ticks
and the snakes and the frogs

250
00:18:22,52 --> 00:18:26,83
and i mean they have it's real
beauty but it wasn't that practice.

251
00:18:26,84 --> 00:18:32,82
And your clothes went mouldy and you
know you got sick and got pretty cold

252
00:18:32,82 --> 00:18:36,45
and damp and wet and i don't
think you could keep that up.

253
00:18:36,65 --> 00:18:40,95
And you know washing your clothes in the
creek with cold water and you know.

254
00:18:41,24 --> 00:18:44,70
I didn't have any electricity because

255
00:18:44,70 --> 00:18:49,94
that was very bush where.

256
00:18:49,96 --> 00:18:54,70
So yeah it was really good to experience
that but it wasn't sustainable.

257
00:18:55,16 --> 00:18:57,62
You know i guess i got sick of that and.

258
00:18:58,31 --> 00:19:03,75
I discovered when i wanted to move back
into the mainstream and hold down a job.

259
00:19:04,19 --> 00:19:05,91
Even if it was a part time job.

260
00:19:05,98 --> 00:19:11,43
Well i had to turn up
looking kind of reasonable.

261
00:19:12,17 --> 00:19:14,15
Wasn't any good if my clothes
were covered in mold

262
00:19:14,15 --> 00:19:16,16
and you know hadn't been washed

263
00:19:16,16 --> 00:19:18,69
and even though i might have
really good reasons for

264
00:19:18,69 --> 00:19:23,83
that it just wasn't going
to go down very well.

265
00:19:25,24 --> 00:19:30,49
Yeah or. It wasn't deliberate.

266
00:19:30,71 --> 00:19:35,31
Yeah it wasn't deliberate to say you know
look how poor we are or whatever but.

267
00:19:35,79 --> 00:19:39,93
But yeah i first were trying to
stretch the limits of how austere

268
00:19:39,93 --> 00:19:44,35
and how self-sufficient i felt really
strongly about being self-sufficient

269
00:19:44,35 --> 00:19:47,60
that it mattered that i grew
my own food and if that meant

270
00:19:47,60 --> 00:19:51,25
that i was only living on you know
the vegetables out of the garden

271
00:19:51,25 --> 00:19:54,93
and that's what i do and i and i
used to feel offended if people went

272
00:19:54,93 --> 00:19:59,95
and bought imported tofu or something
like that. You know if ended some.

273
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:05,00
I'm really strongly held principle and
you know you could make your own clothes

274
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:08,82
and could recycle and you know you
could cut down use of the car

275
00:20:08,82 --> 00:20:12,47
and we didn't need electricity and
hot water was a bit of a luxury

276
00:20:12,47 --> 00:20:17,86
and yet i think i took
it a bit farther than.

277
00:20:17,88 --> 00:20:23,37
All those. Right.

278
00:20:23,51 --> 00:20:28,49
Well the book's called in the
tiger's mouth and that grew out of

279
00:20:28,49 --> 00:20:34,95
that for some time we were joined on the
community by a buddhist monk who was a

280
00:20:34,95 --> 00:20:39,33
political refugee from thailand his life
was threatened by his political activities

281
00:20:40,71 --> 00:20:45,52
and so he lived on the farm and
wrote poetry and paintings

282
00:20:45,52 --> 00:20:51,73
and contemplated and he gave a painting
to each person on the community

283
00:20:51,73 --> 00:20:54,38
and i came home one day and
on the floor of my hut.

284
00:20:54,45 --> 00:21:00,89
He had done this painting in very
simple brushstrokes of a rampant tiger

285
00:21:00,89 --> 00:21:05,70
and the caption was the best place for
meditation is in the tiger's mouth

286
00:21:06,43 --> 00:21:11,21
and i couldn't make a lot of sense of
it at the time but i realized later

287
00:21:11,21 --> 00:21:15,82
that then i was very much into withdrawal
that i wanted to practice meditation

288
00:21:16,66 --> 00:21:22,56
and be away from the
hurly burly to be quiet

289
00:21:22,56 --> 00:21:26,37
and to be with my my clan
with my chosen family

290
00:21:26,37 --> 00:21:32,55
and perhaps not have to mix it with that
rather yucky world out there and later

291
00:21:32,56 --> 00:21:35,97
when we came involved in
campaigns to save the rainforest

292
00:21:35,97 --> 00:21:40,37
and in other social issues. I
realized what he was getting at.

293
00:21:40,46 --> 00:21:44,80
He was saying hey maybe meditation
really has its fruition

294
00:21:44,80 --> 00:21:49,81
when you can keep an open mind and
open heart and the spirit of inquiry

295
00:21:49,81 --> 00:21:54,19
when you're in the thick of it.
You know and get back out there.

296
00:21:54,94 --> 00:21:59,64
So that's been my challenge and i think
that he was what i was trying to tell me.

297
00:22:03,44 --> 00:22:07,82
How. Yes. Yep here.

298
00:22:07,90 --> 00:22:12,83
Initially i think my focus
was on my personal growth

299
00:22:12,83 --> 00:22:15,89
and our groups personal growth
and creating alternatives

300
00:22:16,58 --> 00:22:23,13
and now i see the movement back into the
mainstream to take what we've learned

301
00:22:23,13 --> 00:22:25,62
and experimented with back in

302
00:22:25,62 --> 00:22:29,43
and take what's good about the
mainstream back into the alternative

303
00:22:29,43 --> 00:22:30,67
that they're not so separate now.

304
00:22:31,02 --> 00:22:32,31
I mean things we were talking about

305
00:22:32,31 --> 00:22:36,88
that were considered extremely
radical i mean organic agriculture.

306
00:22:36,90 --> 00:22:42,14
Or or even you know sharing
in community or things like

307
00:22:42,14 --> 00:22:46,65
that are now just very run of the military
everybody can talk about it which is

308
00:22:46,65 --> 00:22:50,30
great. Challenges.

309
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:57,68
Our heads. Well the world
still in a pretty bad state.

310
00:22:58,27 --> 00:23:03,34
And there's just a mean it's a worse
state than it was 14 years ago.

311
00:23:03,43 --> 00:23:08,46
Maybe you nuclear cloud has lifted somewhat
although we have still have an enormous

312
00:23:08,46 --> 00:23:14,47
threat from nuclear waste.
That it hasn't gone away.

313
00:23:14,49 --> 00:23:19,45
So there's lots of challenges about how
we're really going to affect change

314
00:23:20,76 --> 00:23:22,30
and to do that.

315
00:23:22,38 --> 00:23:26,30
We're going to have to work together in
ways which we've only had glimpses of.

316
00:23:26,98 --> 00:23:33,62
And i think one of the pros the
legacies of the post aquarius was

317
00:23:33,62 --> 00:23:36,37
you know how can we can
come together and live

318
00:23:36,37 --> 00:23:40,31
and learn from each other in
a in a very open way that

319
00:23:41,21 --> 00:23:43,30
that lesson still needs to go on.

320
00:23:43,36 --> 00:23:48,22
You know we need to know how how can
we actually sustain life on earth

321
00:23:48,22 --> 00:23:51,10
and cooperate and understand each other.

322
00:23:52,31 --> 00:23:57,76
It's i mean it's happening all over the
world not just the syria of course.

323
00:23:57,78 --> 00:23:59,52
But we need it more than ever.

324
00:24:02,11 --> 00:24:06,88
Then.

325
00:24:09,42 --> 00:24:10,60
Right.

326
00:24:10,62 --> 00:24:16,82
Initially my spiritual search was focused
very much on meditation practice.

327
00:24:17,13 --> 00:24:24,12
I saw that as being the main vehicle
for growth and change and must.

328
00:24:24,35 --> 00:24:29,90
My sitting practice to getting contact
with deeper energies within myself

329
00:24:29,90 --> 00:24:35,84
and to understand my mind
and. It's hard to talk.

330
00:24:37,54 --> 00:24:43,21
And living as a strong ethical structure
of the buddhist precepts was important.

331
00:24:44,86 --> 00:24:49,69
Now i see that is still important. I
don't meditate as much as i used to.

332
00:24:49,71 --> 00:24:54,12
I still like to have a
retreat. Once a year.

333
00:24:54,77 --> 00:24:59,51
But we can be in silence and get back
in contact with myself but i try

334
00:24:59,51 --> 00:25:05,25
and bring my spiritual practice into
everything i do you know whether it's doing

335
00:25:05,25 --> 00:25:07,33
the counselling work i do with women

336
00:25:07,33 --> 00:25:12,34
or working on a campaign to clean
up you know the local area

337
00:25:12,34 --> 00:25:18,01
or working on a committee in the local
government to introduce more community

338
00:25:18,01 --> 00:25:19,59
consultation. I see

339
00:25:19,59 --> 00:25:23,30
that as the arena for spiritual practice
how can i listen to this person

340
00:25:23,99 --> 00:25:26,35
that i have incredibly
different views with.

341
00:25:26,69 --> 00:25:32,53
And still stay open hearted and how
can i find a way to cooperate.

342
00:25:32,56 --> 00:25:38,97
You know how can i work on my own stuff
so that we're not so much in conflict.

343
00:25:39,80 --> 00:25:41,28
Heck and i maintain my balance

344
00:25:41,28 --> 00:25:45,24
and how can i keep trusting
you know just trusting that

345
00:25:45,24 --> 00:25:50,16
that there's good in other people
that there's good around me and

346
00:25:50,16 --> 00:25:54,56
that i can draw on energy that's
much bigger and wider than me.

347
00:25:54,72 --> 00:25:59,95
I mean this times when i'm running
workshops and maybe emphasis.

348
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:01,03
Let having a conflict

349
00:26:01,03 --> 00:26:05,14
that happened last week a large
group 33 people lots of conflict

350
00:26:05,14 --> 00:26:08,41
and they've brought me into
try and you know fix it up

351
00:26:08,41 --> 00:26:13,10
and i'm standing there thinking hell i
can't do this you know this is too hard.

352
00:26:13,21 --> 00:26:15,65
I'd rather be anywhere but
here this just feel terrible.

353
00:26:16,42 --> 00:26:19,74
But maybe it's just that moment
of thinking well i'm not just me.

354
00:26:20,57 --> 00:26:23,84
You know maybe i can open
myself to wider energies.

355
00:26:24,12 --> 00:26:30,41
You know can i be a channel here for having
these people appreciate each other you

356
00:26:30,41 --> 00:26:35,76
know to get back to basics and find some
some caring and. Willing to listen.

357
00:26:36,30 --> 00:26:41,35
And so maybe it's just a moment
of reflection and grounding and.

358
00:26:41,37 --> 00:26:46,38
Prayer really and and when i do that.

359
00:26:47,92 --> 00:26:52,74
Amazing things happen you know and i
know that's not just coming from me so.

360
00:26:54,04 --> 00:26:59,64
I guess that's how some of the ways in which
i experience my spiritual practice now

361
00:27:00,45 --> 00:27:05,64
here you know.

362
00:27:07,29 --> 00:27:12,52
I remain optimistic by seeing
results you actually see

363
00:27:12,52 --> 00:27:17,73
that the stuff works that
people can cooperate that.

364
00:27:18,30 --> 00:27:20,50
I've experienced growth in myself.

365
00:27:20,77 --> 00:27:23,47
I've experienced in almost
growth in the people around me.

366
00:27:23,69 --> 00:27:26,69
I've seen groups turn around
from a point of conflict

367
00:27:26,69 --> 00:27:29,94
and hopelessness to
optimism and cooperation.

368
00:27:30,65 --> 00:27:37,28
I've seen campaigns that
work. I've seen how so.

369
00:27:37,33 --> 00:27:41,72
The change in consciousness about
rainforests you know in in 10 years.

370
00:27:41,78 --> 00:27:48,44
It's really turned around so i
remain optimistic by seeing the

371
00:27:48,44 --> 00:27:53,83
results and by having a good time to go

372
00:27:55,12 --> 00:27:59,66
that. I enjoy what i do and that.

373
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,88
It feeds me and. I work with a lot
of loving people and that feeds me.

374
00:28:06,72 --> 00:28:11,37
Yeah you do so.

375
00:28:11,38 --> 00:28:14,84
Yeah i think they are i think
they're very they're query

376
00:28:14,84 --> 00:28:17,11
and ideals i see as being very relevant.

377
00:28:17,26 --> 00:28:22,85
I mean they're not know about long
hair and beards and you know barefoot

378
00:28:22,85 --> 00:28:25,43
and pregnant. I mean that
they were very much externals

379
00:28:26,44 --> 00:28:33,27
but i see the values of cooperation of
living closely to the earth to be open

380
00:28:33,27 --> 00:28:38,61
to nature voluntary simplicity
experimentation personal growth.

381
00:28:38,86 --> 00:28:43,33
I see them as incredibly relevant more
relevant now than they were then you know

382
00:28:43,33 --> 00:28:46,75
that. Perhaps

383
00:28:46,75 --> 00:28:48,58
that was naive idealism

384
00:28:50,56 --> 00:28:54,92
and perhaps it would.

385
00:28:56,87 --> 00:28:59,01
Have lost the word its.

386
00:29:00,07 --> 00:29:05,36
Self-absorption but they were good ideals

387
00:29:05,36 --> 00:29:12,31
and i see the nineties as being you know
the place where they're needed more than

388
00:29:12,31 --> 00:29:15,25
ever. You know they the
excesses of the 80s

389
00:29:15,25 --> 00:29:18,84
and the greed of the 80s
has really taught us

390
00:29:18,84 --> 00:29:24,82
that we need it more than ever.

391
00:29:27,18 --> 00:29:28,96
When you hear.

392
00:29:29,06 --> 00:29:34,65
I say women's issue as being a strong thread
that's been running through the growth

393
00:29:34,65 --> 00:29:38,67
and change. I mean for me as a
woman but also in the movements.

394
00:29:38,70 --> 00:29:44,63
I remember we made a video of the struggle
for to rainier creek rainforest about

395
00:29:46,48 --> 00:29:50,72
13 years ago and in playing it again.

396
00:29:51,23 --> 00:29:52,72
I mean people say yeah

397
00:29:52,72 --> 00:29:55,93
but where are the women you know the
guys we're getting up and talking.

398
00:29:56,09 --> 00:29:59,86
They were really taking the lead. We
were certainly there we were doing.

399
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,98
In a lot of work but we weren't speaking
up and we didn't see that as our place.

400
00:30:06,05 --> 00:30:07,59
You know.

401
00:30:07,61 --> 00:30:12,14
So in fact there was a hell of a lot of an
ism really running through a lot of the

402
00:30:12,14 --> 00:30:14,52
alternative communities
the women were barefoot

403
00:30:14,52 --> 00:30:17,37
and pregnant washing the nappies
wala guys were our building

404
00:30:17,37 --> 00:30:19,97
and in fact sex roles were very strong

405
00:30:19,97 --> 00:30:24,20
and they they were very strong in
a lot of social change groups.

406
00:30:24,32 --> 00:30:29,20
So it's been really important for women
to get together and to empower ourselves

407
00:30:29,20 --> 00:30:35,42
and to draw on the wider women's movement
to nourish action within the alternative

408
00:30:35,42 --> 00:30:38,84
community and in our piece groups

409
00:30:38,84 --> 00:30:45,39
and in our community action groups to say
hey we've got we've got an equal voice

410
00:30:45,39 --> 00:30:48,79
we've got skills. We need to be empowered.

411
00:30:48,86 --> 00:30:53,65
We need to empower each other
and work together is a calls

412
00:30:53,65 --> 00:30:57,16
and so that's been that's been
an important lesson i think

413
00:30:57,16 --> 00:31:01,13
that came quite late to the
alternative movement or things

414
00:31:01,13 --> 00:31:06,30
that were acceptable still on communities
around here wouldn't have been acceptable

415
00:31:06,30 --> 00:31:12,99
and in many of the city
groups. That you know.

416
00:31:13,48 --> 00:31:16,27
Who are you know. The
differences were higher.

417
00:31:16,50 --> 00:31:20,45
So yes yes i think the the
sheer physical reality

418
00:31:20,45 --> 00:31:25,63
that many of us were living in unfortunately
initially highlighted some of the sex

419
00:31:25,63 --> 00:31:29,33
roles. Look there's a baby on the way
and there's a house to be built.

420
00:31:29,39 --> 00:31:33,50
You know is this a time for the woman
tell you know start at square one.

421
00:31:33,75 --> 00:31:34,51
Learning how to build

422
00:31:35,90 --> 00:31:40,36
or she's got a baby on a hip i mean who you
know is it going to be quicker for her

423
00:31:40,36 --> 00:31:43,27
to wash the nappies and feed the
baby and him to get on with building

424
00:31:43,27 --> 00:31:45,21
and unfortunately.

425
00:31:45,22 --> 00:31:51,07
You know officially ruled often
and and it's and it got more

426
00:31:51,07 --> 00:31:54,57
and more engrained in that
way but many of us said hey.
