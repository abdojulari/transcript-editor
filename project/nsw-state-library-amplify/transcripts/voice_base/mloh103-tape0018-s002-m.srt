1
00:00:12,61 --> 00:00:15,41
Yes. Yeah right.

2
00:00:15,42 --> 00:00:19,66
Although all the hippie
dimmer and all the.

3
00:00:19,67 --> 00:00:23,55
Sort of drug drug culture
and and yuppies and all

4
00:00:23,55 --> 00:00:28,28
that stuff lives over there for me personally
which is. 10 kilometers to the east.

5
00:00:28,86 --> 00:00:31,95
And nimbin for me has
always been the sanctuary.

6
00:00:31,97 --> 00:00:35,46
You know this this place is
abundance and plenitude where.

7
00:00:35,93 --> 00:00:40,85
I learnt how to look up to the gardens
how to look after the horses.

8
00:00:40,87 --> 00:00:44,23
How do i had a witness to
where they're coming over

9
00:00:44,23 --> 00:00:45,67
and do all those country things

10
00:00:45,67 --> 00:00:50,70
and you know probably above everything how
to look after myself my family you know

11
00:00:50,70 --> 00:00:54,10
without all the added stresses of.

12
00:00:54,12 --> 00:00:59,16
Of a full long occupational career
or or travelling or cars or traffic

13
00:00:59,16 --> 00:01:03,30
or buildings or media or
communications and all those sort of.

14
00:01:03,88 --> 00:01:08,79
Distorting and disturbing things you
know taking in big doses and so.

15
00:01:09,55 --> 00:01:13,49
So what it is for me here is
a natural basis for living.

16
00:01:15,20 --> 00:01:21,90
Which is beautiful enough not
to have to be invaded by by

17
00:01:21,90 --> 00:01:25,88
civilisation and that's what you see
you know when you look out the window.

18
00:01:25,90 --> 00:01:32,97
That's what you can see out there.

19
00:01:32,99 --> 00:01:35,95
Well i think that i spent time in the city

20
00:01:35,95 --> 00:01:38,59
and i thought i spent long enough
there to know what it was like.

21
00:01:38,74 --> 00:01:41,92
I went to high school there
during my high school career

22
00:01:41,92 --> 00:01:46,64
and you know growing up there. My father
lives down there not like down there so.

23
00:01:46,66 --> 00:01:49,80
I mean. Thank god. When you've
got the best of both worlds.

24
00:01:50,18 --> 00:01:54,62
You know you lucky enough to sort of have
the bit you know what the city can offer

25
00:01:54,62 --> 00:01:55,62
and what the country can offer

26
00:01:56,90 --> 00:02:00,57
but you know given the choice i think i
always choose what. What you have up here.

27
00:02:01,95 --> 00:02:07,23
Cities great but i think the cities for.
It just seems like such a fragile place.

28
00:02:07,48 --> 00:02:10,70
You know it's a sort of it's
a whole system of its own

29
00:02:10,70 --> 00:02:13,10
that looks like it's on the verge
of constantly falling down.

30
00:02:13,91 --> 00:02:15,70
And i wonder if one day it
will actually fall down

31
00:02:15,70 --> 00:02:20,76
and all those people won't have
anywhere to go. I think. You know.

32
00:02:22,45 --> 00:02:27,37
So this is where it's
at for me. My pleasure.

33
00:02:35,63 --> 00:02:39,72
What i'd like to offer is a
conclusion to to all of this is that.

34
00:02:39,74 --> 00:02:41,72
I think the media and

35
00:02:41,72 --> 00:02:48,09
and general interest amongst australians
elsewhere has been a particularly

36
00:02:49,50 --> 00:02:52,13
confrontational stranger
or frightening place

37
00:02:52,13 --> 00:02:55,94
and i think what really is important
for people to understand now is that.

38
00:02:57,44 --> 00:02:58,64
Is that nimbin is integrating

39
00:02:58,64 --> 00:03:05,53
and is becoming much more much
more than what would people

40
00:03:05,53 --> 00:03:07,81
would normally think and i think
that's what's important about it

41
00:03:07,81 --> 00:03:11,93
that it needn't be this
unique or special or mystical

42
00:03:11,93 --> 00:03:14,01
or transcendent place
at all which it isn't

43
00:03:14,87 --> 00:03:18,57
but just be a a beautiful
haven for people to come to

44
00:03:18,57 --> 00:03:22,12
when they want to you know.

45
00:03:30,98 --> 00:03:33,22
Absolutely yeah. They've actually.

46
00:03:33,91 --> 00:03:37,42
And they've actually been able to
blend so much into mainstream media

47
00:03:37,42 --> 00:03:40,60
and understanding in communications
that yeah they've overlaps now

48
00:03:40,60 --> 00:03:45,25
and i think the thing about nimbin as
it's not it's not going to perform

49
00:03:45,25 --> 00:03:46,81
that role too much in the future anymore.

50
00:03:47,09 --> 00:03:48,96
Sure it's got a permaculture hammered

51
00:03:48,96 --> 00:03:52,31
and it's called her live energy systems
which is very much technological

52
00:03:52,31 --> 00:03:53,33
developments but the whole.

53
00:03:53,92 --> 00:03:59,89
Ethical and spiritual and societal
influence which nimbin has had a.

54
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:01,11
These is not so much.

55
00:04:01,25 --> 00:04:01,78
The issue anymore

56
00:04:03,08 --> 00:04:06,31
and i don't think people should
should have false expectations are

57
00:04:06,31 --> 00:04:10,72
that.

58
00:04:12,93 --> 00:04:18,12
Sure if not prefer if not prophetical
visionary it's there's a stereotypical image

59
00:04:18,12 --> 00:04:24,03
of of ultra ultra decadence or ultra
self-indulgence altar. Ultra nihilism.

60
00:04:24,34 --> 00:04:26,79
You know existentially angst sort
of floating around the place

61
00:04:26,79 --> 00:04:29,78
and sure that's true but but
isn't that the same everywhere

62
00:04:30,54 --> 00:04:33,29
and it is not sort of nimbin just
a reflection of any anywhere else

63
00:04:34,11 --> 00:04:37,63
and i mean you can walk
down 20 places in sydney

64
00:04:37,63 --> 00:04:41,77
and see a microcosm of what nimbin
is you know just in urban terms.

65
00:04:41,95 --> 00:04:45,18
So i think nimbin is always
held this this sort of.

66
00:04:45,86 --> 00:04:50,52
Intriguing mysterious role in
australian society since the early 70s

67
00:04:51,50 --> 00:04:54,28
and i think now it's time for
people who are out there

68
00:04:54,28 --> 00:04:58,95
and living in in conservative
suburban homes to realise that

69
00:04:58,95 --> 00:05:01,51
that the changes got to
start happening from there.

70
00:05:01,51 --> 00:05:05,32
Now you know newman's alright but it's
just it's going to sort of grow along

71
00:05:05,32 --> 00:05:10,17
and you know sort of happily develop into
a senile obsolescence you know while ever

72
00:05:10,17 --> 00:05:13,54
everything else just keeps on blowing
up and i think that's important for.

73
00:05:14,17 --> 00:05:19,86
For suburban people for people who live out
there amongst amongst millions of other

74
00:05:19,86 --> 00:05:23,67
people to understand that that
it's important to learn how to.

75
00:05:23,69 --> 00:05:26,71
How to organize their lives
in a more ethical and

76
00:05:26,71 --> 00:05:32,57
and sound way.

77
00:05:34,15 --> 00:05:39,76
I hope i do so. Throw forces
of december you know to.

78
00:05:39,78 --> 00:05:46,76
Speaking with gloria constrain
can you see o n s t i n e

79
00:05:50,40 --> 00:05:54,60
t o when i'm gloria constrained.

80
00:05:54,61 --> 00:05:58,10
And i work at the nimbin news.

81
00:06:03,49 --> 00:06:08,38
Well i've been in the mean
about you know 10 to 11 years.

82
00:06:08,40 --> 00:06:11,89
I visited nimbin for two years
before that and sassed it out

83
00:06:13,82 --> 00:06:18,90
and use a do a paper in melbourne
before i came up here.

84
00:06:19,10 --> 00:06:26,10
So it was pretty relevant to get
in get involved with an image use

85
00:06:26,10 --> 00:06:31,70
which i did about. Or between
eight and nine years ago.

86
00:06:31,72 --> 00:06:37,38
Just doing different things.
Interviews and what have you.

87
00:06:38,46 --> 00:06:44,06
This year old. Now it's much bigger.

88
00:06:44,90 --> 00:06:50,17
So you are the. The.

89
00:06:51,29 --> 00:06:54,03
The difference between this paper
and the paper i did before was

90
00:06:54,03 --> 00:06:57,93
that there's an office immoralities and
that is that they're all voluntary

91
00:06:57,93 --> 00:07:00,16
that you don't get paid or anything.

92
00:07:01,90 --> 00:07:04,40
This is just bigger and
it's more involved in this.

93
00:07:06,36 --> 00:07:12,03
Wider wider range of topics. Yeah.

94
00:07:12,04 --> 00:07:18,83
Can you.

95
00:07:20,55 --> 00:07:27,30
Oh see if they were reading it for
the first time i suppose you get an

96
00:07:27,30 --> 00:07:31,63
overview or you get a an insight
into what's happening to our nimbin.

97
00:07:33,16 --> 00:07:36,40
We get lots of letters come in in some of.

98
00:07:36,97 --> 00:07:41,42
Criticising different
aspects of the society and.

99
00:07:41,87 --> 00:07:44,46
Replies to that but.

100
00:07:44,48 --> 00:07:46,78
Just different letters
from different people

101
00:07:46,78 --> 00:07:53,10
that gives a good idea of
what's happening and we also.

102
00:07:53,11 --> 00:07:58,06
We edit material out of other
magazines that we swap with.

103
00:07:58,08 --> 00:08:01,21
So that the most up to date. It
information it's like really.

104
00:08:02,35 --> 00:08:07,18
I a p of nimbin if you like we will edit
out all the information you think's

105
00:08:07,18 --> 00:08:10,67
important that people should
know and get that in there.

106
00:08:10,76 --> 00:08:14,87
We want to educate people.

107
00:08:14,89 --> 00:08:22,19
So as to work.

108
00:08:23,66 --> 00:08:27,51
Yeah i can do that.

109
00:08:28,68 --> 00:08:35,61
I k the sources who are we've got plenty
of sources this social alternative organic

110
00:08:35,62 --> 00:08:40,29
news to me. Chain reaction.

111
00:08:40,31 --> 00:08:46,22
I otoh from japan. Silver cord this one.

112
00:08:48,70 --> 00:08:52,98
The whole person. Animals agenda for.

Columbia some of these are
from overseas sof technology.

114
00:08:59,81 --> 00:09:04,03
Because grab newsletter. Down to earth.

115
00:09:05,59 --> 00:09:12,04
Elemental. Nexis first garden

116
00:09:12,14 --> 00:09:15,61
I mean we get them always great.

117
00:09:15,63 --> 00:09:19,61
So much.

118
00:09:22,16 --> 00:09:24,07
Are male. I really know.

119
00:09:24,09 --> 00:09:31,04
Asking miles today is no mind you get
quite a bit get quite a bit of you know

120
00:09:31,04 --> 00:09:32,85
the end of month we get the magazines come

121
00:09:32,85 --> 00:09:37,15
and in the monthlies we also get a lot of
we seem to be on somebodies list which i

122
00:09:37,15 --> 00:09:42,26
wish we weren't we get all these
media releases of beauty products

123
00:09:42,26 --> 00:09:46,05
and pet things and you
know i mean all the stuff

124
00:09:46,05 --> 00:09:47,47
that we're really not interested in.

125
00:09:47,59 --> 00:09:52,75
Oh you know they just send all of this stuff
i mean it was even a purchase sent to

126
00:09:52,75 --> 00:09:58,31
the mail which you couldn't even
undo the class but. I just me.

127
00:09:58,33 --> 00:10:01,90
I really wish they did so the time. Yes
off their list and save their money.

128
00:10:02,19 --> 00:10:06,38
You know.

129
00:10:06,40 --> 00:10:11,48
Why we don't know who's put us on
some list but obviously with air

130
00:10:11,48 --> 00:10:16,39
and we get all this stuff we've net stuff
from telecom which wasn't too bad i

131
00:10:16,39 --> 00:10:19,72
suppose that you know i mean
we hear from them anyway.

132
00:10:19,90 --> 00:10:26,80
Each time when they want their money.

133
00:10:26,82 --> 00:10:31,43
Now i just resent being on on a list
of which gives people they've got the

134
00:10:31,43 --> 00:10:33,12
impression that the stuff

135
00:10:33,12 --> 00:10:37,70
that they're sending in these is is getting
you know having noticed taken over

136
00:10:37,70 --> 00:10:41,05
when you know it just gets put in the.

137
00:10:41,07 --> 00:10:45,33
Unsolicited media releases.

138
00:10:45,35 --> 00:10:52,31
Pile and that's where it stays.
Through. Yeah i know if this civil.

139
00:10:52,58 --> 00:10:56,95
Problem though we were sending them back
at first but they still sent them out.

140
00:10:57,27 --> 00:11:03,35
I mean we say we get something from them
every week people we get stuff every week

141
00:11:03,35 --> 00:11:09,91
you know if incredible. Not much of the
stuff we can that we can use at all.

142
00:11:11,07 --> 00:11:16,10
In fact very very little. World.

143
00:11:18,01 --> 00:11:21,06
I think you know it's an australian list
obviously we're not getting stuff from

144
00:11:21,06 --> 00:11:24,97
elsewhere. You know.

145
00:11:26,06 --> 00:11:31,89
What's in the sort of
covered in the region.

146
00:11:32,37 --> 00:11:35,21
You know through.

147
00:11:35,22 --> 00:11:44,74
Topics.

148
00:11:44,75 --> 00:11:48,22
Well we get lots and lots of
power tree which is great.

149
00:11:49,41 --> 00:11:55,78
Really nice way of expressing yourself and
apparently you can't get sued. Health.

150
00:11:56,05 --> 00:11:59,65
You know forestry forest
problems you know.

151
00:12:00,20 --> 00:12:06,57
Then the environment is a predominance
you know having a say in ecology.

152
00:12:06,99 --> 00:12:08,36
If a logical movement.

153
00:12:08,40 --> 00:12:11,77
You know trying to find the best
ways of doing things are things

154
00:12:11,77 --> 00:12:15,63
that ways of doing things information
of the ways of doing things

155
00:12:15,63 --> 00:12:18,70
that is not going to pollute
the environment and.

156
00:12:19,27 --> 00:12:22,36
Send us to our destruction
which i think is something

157
00:12:22,36 --> 00:12:26,82
that that's affecting everybody even if
they don't talk about it very much is still

158
00:12:26,82 --> 00:12:29,84
a sort of a depressing thought
to think that you know.

159
00:12:29,86 --> 00:12:34,67
The world as we know it
might not be viable. For.

160
00:12:34,68 --> 00:12:40,94
For the end of our lifetimes
amount about the future.

161
00:12:40,95 --> 00:12:46,49
Local issue.

162
00:12:47,93 --> 00:12:55,24
So yeah there's there are
fairly heavy debates.

163
00:12:56,29 --> 00:13:02,10
We we just give give people the
opportunity to debate that

164
00:13:02,10 --> 00:13:04,07
that in the paper.

165
00:13:04,89 --> 00:13:10,87
I think it is there's always
a tendency that people.

166
00:13:10,89 --> 00:13:17,80
Don't miss train themselves to the
actual issue rather than they tend

167
00:13:17,80 --> 00:13:20,48
to attack the person which is you know.

168
00:13:21,14 --> 00:13:26,95
Not the best way to do things
the issue is is what's at stake

169
00:13:28,31 --> 00:13:35,18
not whether you. Put somebody
down or make somebody feel silly.

170
00:13:35,20 --> 00:13:37,32
Extreme free press.

171
00:13:42,04 --> 00:13:45,73
Well it's not as i mean we don't treat
everything that comes in a some stuff.

172
00:13:46,34 --> 00:13:50,83
We were given some stuff from a guy. Mr.

173
00:13:50,84 --> 00:13:57,33
Ping actually who went to where was he
got he was overseas somewhere south

174
00:13:57,33 --> 00:13:59,93
america and we sent in a staff and there.

175
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:01,91
I mean we've seen this
copious amounts of stuff

176
00:14:01,91 --> 00:14:05,52
that we couldn't we couldn't
get any make any sense of.

177
00:14:06,19 --> 00:14:11,18
While he was in australia and when he went
to south america. He sent us more so.

178
00:14:13,01 --> 00:14:18,92
But. Sorry.

179
00:14:18,93 --> 00:14:21,04
So you know.

180
00:14:21,06 --> 00:14:23,59
He hasn't sent them for why i
think maybe you got the message

181
00:14:24,55 --> 00:14:30,68
but he was attacking other people in his
letters too so you know i got bit personal.

182
00:14:31,51 --> 00:14:33,57
Politics and politics

183
00:14:33,57 --> 00:14:38,62
and passion.

184
00:14:39,66 --> 00:14:42,02
Was the local politics.

185
00:14:42,20 --> 00:14:46,26
Yeah yeah there's there's lots
of different cliques and groups

186
00:14:46,26 --> 00:14:52,96
and people. Different ideas
different ideas all over the place.

187
00:14:54,23 --> 00:15:00,85
There's no range from the super very
cool to the super straight if you like

188
00:15:00,85 --> 00:15:05,32
beyond i suppose but within that range.

189
00:15:06,15 --> 00:15:12,56
Is is an indonesian democratic

190
00:15:13,34 --> 00:15:17,78
democratic or most i don't
know about democratic.

191
00:15:17,80 --> 00:15:20,34
I like it and they can

192
00:15:20,34 --> 00:15:27,15
and i think anarchistic
they make them ok i say

193
00:15:27,15 --> 00:15:31,99
anarchistic democracy.

194
00:15:32,84 --> 00:15:38,50
I don't know that i could put
the two words together. But.

195
00:15:38,52 --> 00:15:42,74
It depends on how many how
my how much you can blab.

196
00:15:42,75 --> 00:15:49,69
And to whom will you know who will
listen to you as to how good you do in

197
00:15:49,69 --> 00:15:54,14
the political political
stuff you know there's.

198
00:15:54,16 --> 00:15:56,38
There's politics and
politics is dirty politics

199
00:15:56,38 --> 00:15:59,95
and this getting your message
across. You know in the day.

200
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,34
Three politics is alive and.

201
00:16:05,23 --> 00:16:07,86
Next week's.

202
00:16:08,96 --> 00:16:13,68
Was the word.

203
00:16:14,62 --> 00:16:18,80
Well exploit work exploitation
is exploiting the situation but.

204
00:16:20,27 --> 00:16:25,34
A situation can happen and
lies and exaggerations.

205
00:16:26,20 --> 00:16:30,41
Become was heard and.

206
00:16:31,29 --> 00:16:36,10
If you don't have an opportunity
to you know if you got the time

207
00:16:36,10 --> 00:16:39,96
or the inclination to go blab blab in
as much as what the opposition has.

208
00:16:40,30 --> 00:16:45,99
Then you sunk.

209
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:47,51
As usual.

210
00:16:49,57 --> 00:16:55,65
For. Shonky cancers.

211
00:16:55,77 --> 00:16:59,15
It's all over everything
even a great move.

212
00:17:00,93 --> 00:17:04,79
Mr jones. Mr jones.

213
00:17:04,81 --> 00:17:11,26
You know that this is going to fare well
that was. That was pretty incredible.

214
00:17:11,48 --> 00:17:15,24
I people come out to me in the street
saying i don't trust fact guy you know.

215
00:17:16,61 --> 00:17:23,38
He's a bit suss and i mean i knew that
but i mean our strategy our policy was

216
00:17:23,38 --> 00:17:26,50
that you know if anybody wants to work
on the name in you say come on with it

217
00:17:27,53 --> 00:17:30,26
and he was willing to do some
working so you sort of came.

218
00:17:32,19 --> 00:17:37,90
This was a time before you just
as we would get in our mail box

219
00:17:37,90 --> 00:17:42,97
and mailbox we were these receiving mail
for this person before we were to see even

220
00:17:42,97 --> 00:17:49,67
any mail for us and. He was he
had great plans of doing a.

221
00:17:49,69 --> 00:17:54,77
Four for the alternative press. You
know lismore alternative place.

222
00:17:55,05 --> 00:17:59,38
It was going to be. And. He
was going to be governor.

223
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:07,45
Going to get a c p grant
of half a million dollars.

224
00:18:07,46 --> 00:18:14,06
Yet people can't paper when they
had a factory vented in this more

225
00:18:14,06 --> 00:18:20,74
and had no sort of nothing really to back
him up because they were on investigation

226
00:18:20,74 --> 00:18:24,05
there was no c p e p grant and.

227
00:18:24,07 --> 00:18:29,90
Anyway then he got to me that. Paid.

228
00:18:30,37 --> 00:18:34,29
Registered the name women
using his name and i mean.

229
00:18:34,57 --> 00:18:36,73
You know you should have
been registered years ago.

230
00:18:36,80 --> 00:18:39,59
I mean nobody i wasn't even aware

231
00:18:39,59 --> 00:18:43,59
that you know registration had to happen
even you know it all those things were

232
00:18:43,59 --> 00:18:44,75
taken care of the time.

233
00:18:45,61 --> 00:18:46,24
He found out

234
00:18:46,24 --> 00:18:49,87
that it wasn't registered an imagist
to do in his name classifying boney's.

235
00:18:50,55 --> 00:18:53,72
And i tricked him into admitting it.

236
00:18:53,85 --> 00:18:59,15
I said you know how much it cost to register
the name women using your name in your

237
00:18:59,15 --> 00:19:03,59
name. How much it cost to
register and him in years and.

238
00:19:03,61 --> 00:19:09,28
He said or i mean were how much it
was but whatever it was 60 bucks.

239
00:19:09,30 --> 00:19:12,75
You know you whose name did you
register in you know my name.

240
00:19:12,77 --> 00:19:15,33
I just like i said dirty
low down trick isn't it.

241
00:19:16,32 --> 00:19:21,15
If you know how comes you know done in
your name. Ice's well that's business.

242
00:19:21,41 --> 00:19:22,66
That's business.

243
00:19:23,27 --> 00:19:28,96
With the shadow the shoulders
and the arms are prized.

244
00:19:28,97 --> 00:19:33,03
So anyway i told him just his name
was going to be made from now on

245
00:19:33,03 --> 00:19:39,17
and he better clear off and bring e his
keys in and bring his keys in first

246
00:19:39,17 --> 00:19:45,60
and then clear off because he
wouldn't be taken seriously anymore.

247
00:19:45,62 --> 00:19:51,35
And.

248
00:19:52,27 --> 00:19:58,47
I actually. The first prime bow news
that came out we were trying to sort of.

249
00:19:59,39 --> 00:19:59,76
Become.

250
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,54
Financial by being in a paper each month
which was going to be alternately the

251
00:20:04,54 --> 00:20:07,42
women news and rainbow
news. So the first round.

252
00:20:07,57 --> 00:20:09,36
I knew that was the next
one that was coming up

253
00:20:09,36 --> 00:20:13,08
and it couldn't wait for the following
one which would be the nimby news.

254
00:20:13,10 --> 00:20:16,45
So i sort of printed
something about it in there

255
00:20:17,75 --> 00:20:21,37
but we eventually got the news
registered in our name after

256
00:20:21,37 --> 00:20:27,37
that will be a fire.

257
00:20:30,06 --> 00:20:32,19
There's lots of mr. jones is out there.

258
00:20:32,21 --> 00:20:51,83
I don't think we want to show his face.

259
00:20:51,84 --> 00:20:57,79
What sort of structure. To
make it work. It's all about.

260
00:20:59,50 --> 00:21:06,53
Oh yes it's still voluntary
although we do have blessings.

261
00:21:08,15 --> 00:21:10,57
Some of our over time i think is.

262
00:21:10,59 --> 00:21:16,14
Swapped for vouchers that enable
us to go and say you know best.

263
00:21:16,28 --> 00:21:21,06
Ron have a massage of the pictures or
something like that. Not very much.

264
00:21:21,25 --> 00:21:23,80
I mean only a very small amount that

265
00:21:23,80 --> 00:21:26,81
that just makes little bit
of icing on the cake for us.

266
00:21:26,89 --> 00:21:30,75
You know apart from being out
the paper we can do that

267
00:21:30,75 --> 00:21:35,49
but.

268
00:21:35,51 --> 00:21:41,02
Yeah. Hardly.

269
00:21:42,68 --> 00:21:47,82
But then yeah. Well stressful. I used
to be stressful it's not anymore.

270
00:21:47,95 --> 00:21:51,34
It's working really really well right now
we've got a great group working together

271
00:21:52,30 --> 00:21:54,59
we. The stuff that comes in.

272
00:21:55,83 --> 00:21:59,92
Either or even the stuff that gets
chosen out of the paper so that it's.

273
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:03,06
We try and take the power out
of positions. If you like.

274
00:22:05,02 --> 00:22:07,86
We don't have an editor and
sabaidee so you know this and

275
00:22:07,86 --> 00:22:12,54
that we just sort of do what we
can and what needs to be done

276
00:22:12,54 --> 00:22:15,16
and we get the paper out and.

277
00:22:15,17 --> 00:22:19,40
You know some of us get better other thing
you know certain things like oh you know

278
00:22:19,40 --> 00:22:22,85
i don't go near the computer but.

279
00:22:22,87 --> 00:22:27,07
Other people who are you know will
we bang the computer and stuff like

280
00:22:27,07 --> 00:22:30,44
that anyway we.

281
00:22:31,18 --> 00:22:33,32
Stuff that comes in we put
it up on the board and

282
00:22:33,32 --> 00:22:38,21
when it's three once i see people voting
for it going to paper then it's potest

283
00:22:38,21 --> 00:22:43,95
going to the paper there might be
stuff there that might get to ones

284
00:22:43,95 --> 00:22:46,54
and twos threes so you know if
you put a three on it means

285
00:22:46,54 --> 00:22:47,67
that you know not recommended.

286
00:22:48,82 --> 00:22:49,76
There's a two which means

287
00:22:49,76 --> 00:22:54,19
that it's a possibility if there's you
know if you start for a filler which we.

288
00:22:54,52 --> 00:22:58,96
When. Not usually we've got
so much stuff on the board.

289
00:22:59,01 --> 00:23:00,45
You know that that could go in that.

290
00:23:01,13 --> 00:23:03,91
We don't really need fillers
but it may need to be a tv hit

291
00:23:03,91 --> 00:23:05,50
or something may need to be done to it.

292
00:23:05,57 --> 00:23:07,50
To make except a ball to go in

293
00:23:08,68 --> 00:23:13,01
or it may be relevant to put it in you know
like might be some kind of food flytrap

294
00:23:13,01 --> 00:23:15,70
or something which is
silly put in the winter

295
00:23:15,70 --> 00:23:22,39
when nobody's thinking
at all about food life.

296
00:23:22,41 --> 00:23:24,91
Yeah yeah yeah.

297
00:23:25,05 --> 00:23:28,00
And of course the the
local stuff the letters

298
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:33,70
and the stuff they've sent
in there's more emphasis on

299
00:23:33,70 --> 00:23:39,56
that there's more has a higher
priorities and any reprinted stuff.

300
00:23:39,87 --> 00:23:45,84
And that goes in. I know
there's an objection to it.

301
00:23:45,94 --> 00:23:52,57
We try and see everything before it goes
in some time and we. There's such a lag.

302
00:23:52,67 --> 00:23:54,59
You know if somebody
is very slow to get in

303
00:23:54,59 --> 00:23:57,43
and we don't even see it before it
goes in and that's only happened once

304
00:23:57,43 --> 00:23:59,06
and there's been a problem with that. So.

305
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,79
We like to be able to see

306
00:24:01,79 --> 00:24:06,11
and i say some make sure nobody's
doing anything daft at least.

307
00:24:06,13 --> 00:24:08,75
In their writing that can get
us and them into trouble.

308
00:24:10,79 --> 00:24:14,07
But it's you know i'm fair enough
if it was stuff put into light

309
00:24:14,07 --> 00:24:17,25
and we don't have a chance to pose
a threat but we've got this space

310
00:24:17,25 --> 00:24:23,92
that we've you know we've got
to get it to the printer.

311
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:30,63
Oh yeah sure. Yeah. Although some people
prefer not to apply and just sort of.

312
00:24:32,36 --> 00:24:36,49
Black and black list anybody
associated with the paper

313
00:24:36,49 --> 00:24:42,22
or you know i mean they're
so that maybe my paranoia.

314
00:24:43,03 --> 00:24:48,32
Is just for. Yeah yeah we've got
subscriptions who are over the place.

315
00:24:48,36 --> 00:24:53,07
We've got enough subscriptions so it's
probably not pushing as much as we could

316
00:24:53,07 --> 00:24:57,68
but. We've even got more one
subscriptions from overseas.

317
00:24:58,04 --> 00:25:02,89
I know too there's a
lively for overseas and.

318
00:25:03,61 --> 00:25:05,24
Yeah we get subscriptions and all over.

319
00:25:05,25 --> 00:25:08,54
We've just been working on our
tides and we're getting in.

320
00:25:10,32 --> 00:25:14,94
We're getting five together of our total
archives which is an horrendous job.

321
00:25:15,54 --> 00:25:18,84
That one of our work is known
as been working on and.

322
00:25:20,07 --> 00:25:22,68
He's doing a magnificent job
just saw in these papers

323
00:25:22,68 --> 00:25:27,43
that we lugged around from place to place
you know all these boxes and boxes

324
00:25:27,43 --> 00:25:34,99
and boxes of paper.

325
00:25:35,00 --> 00:25:38,90
You did. Of the offices.

326
00:25:40,67 --> 00:25:42,45
Will in the time i've been with it.

327
00:25:42,52 --> 00:25:47,93
We've we've been under the town hall
and that was a real rammy place.

328
00:25:48,45 --> 00:25:54,44
Like. This was a very nice.

329
00:25:54,56 --> 00:25:59,95
It always very ganji as there was you
know there's a floor above us and it.

330
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,53
When he walked on the floor then you get
all this stuff coming through the ceiling.

331
00:26:03,77 --> 00:26:08,72
It was horrible. Everything
was covered in a lot.

332
00:26:09,48 --> 00:26:13,81
I mean you know you clear
away you know and.

333
00:26:14,58 --> 00:26:18,28
You know.

334
00:26:18,30 --> 00:26:24,19
Our head out there you know i mean you
know i can think you know i'm sure

335
00:26:24,19 --> 00:26:28,34
that somewhere in india there
was something someplace worth.

336
00:26:29,11 --> 00:26:31,22
But i mean it was good
to be able to be there

337
00:26:31,22 --> 00:26:33,48
and it was a it was a start for
us we didn't have any money.

338
00:26:33,62 --> 00:26:38,81
We couldn't pay when we were in
town which was very good and.

339
00:26:38,83 --> 00:26:46,88
I mean my aversion to god is not sort
of necessarily everybody's problem.

340
00:26:46,90 --> 00:26:53,51
And then we then we vented a boom from
the. Community school which really nice.

341
00:26:53,53 --> 00:26:57,04
Spent about a year there i think
maybe a little bit longer

342
00:26:57,04 --> 00:27:02,45
but then i went away. On
the peace train i think.

343
00:27:03,53 --> 00:27:03,63
Then

344
00:27:03,64 --> 00:27:08,17
when i came back we were all packed up
underneath the tomato sauce factory because

345
00:27:08,17 --> 00:27:11,42
the school needed their
room. We had nowhere to go.

346
00:27:11,67 --> 00:27:16,25
So then we managed to get a house
the brown house it tenable falls

347
00:27:17,48 --> 00:27:20,99
and. We.

348
00:27:22,07 --> 00:27:25,37
We moved in there and that was really good
a whole house ourselves it was amazing.

349
00:27:25,66 --> 00:27:27,70
We've got the phone on. Wow.

350
00:27:28,08 --> 00:27:34,92
I was really coming up in the world
and we got a printing press from the.

351
00:27:35,88 --> 00:27:41,64
An op shop actually and got this going.
He was an offset printing press.

352
00:27:42,71 --> 00:27:45,74
And yeah we got that going in and had

353
00:27:45,74 --> 00:27:51,95
that going for a while was pretty
pretty hard work and set up the office

354
00:27:51,95 --> 00:27:57,28
and you know just just tried our way in
to get in heaven a little bit of money

355
00:27:57,28 --> 00:28:01,88
and paying the bills and they never.
We think to pay the workers at all.

356
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:07,57
And now we've got this. We were
there about three years and now.

357
00:28:07,73 --> 00:28:12,58
Now six years which is what
was the time go so fast

358
00:28:12,58 --> 00:28:18,51
and six years we were there and
now we're in this office in town.

359
00:28:18,87 --> 00:28:22,41
Behind sam's organic food shop

360
00:28:23,65 --> 00:28:26,01
and it's great to be in the sun and

361
00:28:26,01 --> 00:28:32,16
that it is very compact we've got to
really organize organize ourselves

362
00:28:32,16 --> 00:28:39,04
and can't have big furniture or anything.
And functions and where we're so now.

363
00:28:39,58 --> 00:28:41,00
We're managing to make it so

364
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:47,51
that it works for us here.

365
00:28:48,85 --> 00:28:54,56
Problem. Or a circular structural.

366
00:28:55,54 --> 00:29:00,92
Pyramid a non hierarchical
structure and yeah.

367
00:29:00,94 --> 00:29:07,65
I don't because you know we all
treat each other really well

368
00:29:07,65 --> 00:29:11,28
actually.

369
00:29:12,39 --> 00:29:15,05
Specially this group is presently here.

370
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:22,86
It's taken a long while but we are taking
power the power out of positions and

371
00:29:22,87 --> 00:29:29,01
that is that you know the editor doesn't
sort of. Pull it pushes wait around.

372
00:29:29,03 --> 00:29:32,81
I never body else we all make the
decisions we have meetings about things

373
00:29:32,81 --> 00:29:36,80
and you know if we've got to going to
spend more than a hundred bucks we make a

374
00:29:36,80 --> 00:29:37,62
decision about it

375
00:29:37,62 --> 00:29:44,14
and if we're going to make a change in
the present strategy we make a decision

376
00:29:44,14 --> 00:29:49,03
about it. We don't sort of
people don't sort of assume

377
00:29:49,03 --> 00:29:52,52
that something's going to happen and
and do it and drag everybody along.

378
00:29:52,80 --> 00:29:55,27
So make decisions about it.

379
00:29:55,32 --> 00:29:58,15
So you know where you go in what
you do and if you wanna take part.

380
00:29:58,25 --> 00:29:59,95
You do anything.

381
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:06,72
Don't you don't know.

382
00:30:08,74 --> 00:30:15,51
The year. Well or they are going.
I think it's going really well.

383
00:30:15,53 --> 00:30:20,21
Financially it's paying its
bills with our went up.

384
00:30:20,79 --> 00:30:26,00
Twofold she filed. For me leaving
tangible to come in here.

385
00:30:26,02 --> 00:30:27,92
But.

386
00:30:27,94 --> 00:30:34,34
We've organized ways of overcoming
you know an increase in advertising

387
00:30:34,34 --> 00:30:41,76
and of course the other
ties in the main income.

388
00:30:42,55 --> 00:30:44,81
Yeah we just make sure
that you know that we.

389
00:30:45,49 --> 00:30:51,59
What we get enough coming in to pay the
bills. That there isn't this as a side.

390
00:30:52,10 --> 00:30:52,47
Taken

391
00:30:52,47 --> 00:30:56,79
that step to actually be in financial as
far as paying people is another matter.

392
00:30:57,98 --> 00:31:01,09
That is. Nowhere near in sight.

393
00:31:04,13 --> 00:31:08,19
So yeah everybody works ok.

394
00:31:09,93 --> 00:31:11,32
Yeah we are really good.

395
00:31:11,46 --> 00:31:15,55
This is good to be able to actually
put your skills to some use.

396
00:31:17,54 --> 00:31:20,09
And produce something that is really good

397
00:31:20,09 --> 00:31:22,76
that people can actually in
the streets they are nothing

398
00:31:22,76 --> 00:31:26,66
when you really good their best
yet you know the last six times

399
00:31:26,66 --> 00:31:30,76
that people have been saying it's the
best yet. So it must be improving.
