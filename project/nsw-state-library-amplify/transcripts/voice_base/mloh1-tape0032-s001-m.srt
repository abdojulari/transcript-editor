1
00:00:01,34 --> 00:00:02,55
Now talking to mr.

2
00:00:02,55 --> 00:00:03,72
Tom ivory who worked as

3
00:00:03,72 --> 00:00:08,12
a an apprentice boilermaker in the dorman
long workshops during the building of the

4
00:00:08,12 --> 00:00:11,94
bridge. During member those times you
remember getting the job day of mr.

5
00:00:11,94 --> 00:00:18,56
Ivory. Oh yes yes i remember them. I
mean you see that signature on my my

6
00:00:20,23 --> 00:00:25,48
you know like papers your reference yeah
yeah i was quite nervous you know mind

7
00:00:25,48 --> 00:00:32,38
going well only sixteen. And we had to
sign papers you know we're going to

8
00:00:33,90 --> 00:00:38,89
witness the leavening like that and you
can see the sea the sealed the sealed and

9
00:00:38,89 --> 00:00:42,96
everything has signed mr.
Henry martin is there a mr.

10
00:00:42,96 --> 00:00:49,74
Alfred martin martin and when you started
in the workshops what job did you do

11
00:00:49,74 --> 00:00:56,02
first. Well i work with pain but fine
and course the marking off shop.

12
00:00:56,90 --> 00:01:02,62
And i minored all the pamphlets and
everything we had special templates and we

13
00:01:02,62 --> 00:01:08,94
marked the angles and food. But. Our
talking to me to pine over there at the

14
00:01:10,46 --> 00:01:13,94
point. And he said to me. We've got

15
00:01:13,94 --> 00:01:19,64
a good pattern aback because our mark you
know food because there was no meaning of

16
00:01:19,64 --> 00:01:24,56
anything necessary. When
they were drilled and here's

17
00:01:24,57 --> 00:01:28,66
a marking office first class everybody
recommends it. Do you do you remember going

18
00:01:28,66 --> 00:01:34,84
up into the market into the template shop.
Oh yes yes that but we used to call the

19
00:01:34,84 --> 00:01:39,44
loft. And. All the temple to

20
00:01:41,82 --> 00:01:48,09
the different places to lay it out and then.
They made the templates. And of course

21
00:01:48,09 --> 00:01:54,23
we use them only angle and so you know
markov and. Then they were of course

22
00:01:55,15 --> 00:02:00,21
everything was doubly checked. I mean if
we had to mark anything. My boss checked

23
00:02:00,21 --> 00:02:07,06
it many got someone else to check
it. All the time. So we could

24
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:11,49
act and how do you ensure that the tapes
for instance that you used for measuring

25
00:02:11,49 --> 00:02:17,12
were exactly right. Oh my word. Yes they
were they were tested all the time types.

26
00:02:17,46 --> 00:02:22,82
And i mean all the patterns and everything.
If they were marked they were doubly

27
00:02:22,82 --> 00:02:28,35
tested because with the tribute of the
timber or anything like that we just check.

28
00:02:28,78 --> 00:02:32,05
How did you go and for temperature if they
changed in length by the temperature.

29
00:02:32,09 --> 00:02:38,66
Well didn't didn't matter so much in the
workshop because the. I think it was all

30
00:02:38,66 --> 00:02:44,39
allowances for shrinkage and expansion
and you know all the time is

31
00:02:44,40 --> 00:02:51,05
a big gap in between. The join is either
expansion joint charlie brown talked of

32
00:02:51,05 --> 00:02:52,05
giving them

33
00:02:52,05 --> 00:02:58,60
a drink in the harbor occasionally.
Well the only dig i got was when when i

34
00:02:58,60 --> 00:03:04,86
joined when the bridge was joined.
We're going to twenty cents. Twenty or

35
00:03:05,86 --> 00:03:09,73
canberra two shilling for beer
and a half a holiday with mr.

36
00:03:09,73 --> 00:03:15,84
Freeman with them and that when you were
did your marking out after that the

37
00:03:16,56 --> 00:03:23,00
cropping and the and also the drilling
was done. Do you remember exactly

38
00:03:24,35 --> 00:03:27,83
how the shot was laid out.
Well it's all the same. Well

39
00:03:27,83 --> 00:03:33,73
a moment and then we had another section
like it was all put together. And

40
00:03:35,05 --> 00:03:41,63
the you know like the certain sections.
Then as it got heavy and went into

41
00:03:41,63 --> 00:03:47,53
a heavy shop and it was all
machine fine. No ledges only

42
00:03:49,07 --> 00:03:54,42
on a patron i think any here.
Get into play here. Will be

43
00:03:54,42 --> 00:04:00,63
a little bit of an age and they had pines
big moving fine and i used to play only

44
00:04:01,50 --> 00:04:08,11
proper so i can take
the edges of the world

45
00:04:09,89 --> 00:04:14,56
was that different to other jobs you
worked on later. Well we moved around the

46
00:04:14,56 --> 00:04:18,49
family line you know like we did a bit
of assembling. And i've still got

47
00:04:18,49 --> 00:04:24,50
a little punch. When we used to make the

48
00:04:25,50 --> 00:04:27,68
washers. Will they strip in

49
00:04:27,68 --> 00:04:33,08
a piece of cast on when i punch you
know. And i think most you carry

50
00:04:33,08 --> 00:04:39,34
a piece of shell. Went into the
tin you and when i move like that

51
00:04:40,24 --> 00:04:44,11
they all the time. All they locate and then
later on when they should. Don't worry

52
00:04:44,11 --> 00:04:50,80
about not moving. Carry that
for fifty years can make that

53
00:04:50,80 --> 00:04:54,93
a bit clearer exactly how did that happen.
What exactly happened. Cast on when

54
00:04:54,93 --> 00:05:01,46
a punch. Will not not like mild steel or
anything like that and it just shattered

55
00:05:02,27 --> 00:05:04,72
a center punch you were using. Back then

56
00:05:04,72 --> 00:05:11,11
a center punch you were using
punch inch inch punch making

57
00:05:11,11 --> 00:05:18,03
a hole for washers. And this piece.
Pushed in you know i can we went numb

58
00:05:18,03 --> 00:05:24,46
through lecturing it just bang it all
question pieces iraqi i didn't get any in the

59
00:05:24,46 --> 00:05:26,18
head who put the face

60
00:05:26,18 --> 00:05:33,12
a cast iron and no one written nobody.
The believer finally can't but

61
00:05:33,91 --> 00:05:38,68
never on the culpable thing
happened was it done as

62
00:05:38,68 --> 00:05:44,25
a joke or it was an accident was an
accident act and different thing. And this

63
00:05:44,25 --> 00:05:50,65
machine used to punch out wash as punch was
she yeah because when the assembly when

64
00:05:50,65 --> 00:05:55,81
doing the simile it had to be tightened up
you know and the watches were pushed on

65
00:05:55,81 --> 00:06:02,71
. To make sure the tightness in
my riveted light and held in

66
00:06:02,71 --> 00:06:09,57
position you know part do you remember
any other accidents in the workshop or.

67
00:06:10,86 --> 00:06:15,99
My my good mate jamie never when i tried

68
00:06:18,38 --> 00:06:23,21
heavy heavy party to go through my
head of i'll you know work with a will

69
00:06:23,21 --> 00:06:27,73
a bogey you know and you to go into the
heavy shop. And of course when i moved and

70
00:06:27,73 --> 00:06:30,17
that jimmy went underneath and he got

71
00:06:30,17 --> 00:06:36,43
a leg he paid for asylum rugby league
one of the first representatives.

72
00:06:38,74 --> 00:06:43,34
Terrible thing to get compensation
for that where i wouldn't have

73
00:06:43,34 --> 00:06:49,92
a clue and when we could. It was just on
the finish of the. Fabrication shop you

74
00:06:49,92 --> 00:06:55,63
know. Well i wouldn't have wouldn't know
anything about the compensation part you

75
00:06:55,63 --> 00:07:01,83
know i would have got compensation and the
compensation started in 1026 where do

76
00:07:01,83 --> 00:07:07,96
you see that happen now. I didn't see it
happen. Well i mean. We were all around

77
00:07:07,96 --> 00:07:14,34
the shop and we heard just one of those
terrible thing. And of course i'm

78
00:07:14,34 --> 00:07:16,78
a boy you know i think there was

79
00:07:16,78 --> 00:07:23,77
a kind of in the heavy shop fill.
And you know. Well not on the

80
00:07:23,77 --> 00:07:30,64
kind always accident was there more
accidents there than elsewhere. Oh no

81
00:07:30,64 --> 00:07:37,64
no no i wouldn't fly. You know like they
had all the first day there wasn't any

82
00:07:38,59 --> 00:07:44,92
terrible accident. You worked
there from twenty six to thirty

83
00:07:44,92 --> 00:07:51,40
thirty one when the workshops closed.
That's right. And then from then on it was.

84
00:07:52,93 --> 00:07:53,62
Depression for

85
00:07:53,62 --> 00:07:59,00
a while. You know what happened to you
when you when you were laid off. Oh well i

86
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:05,96
work on my belly farrier
you know under the big two

87
00:08:05,96 --> 00:08:12,77
as i was hearing horses and you
know anything for you know

88
00:08:12,77 --> 00:08:19,61
could we ever on the dow now and
everyone of our neville now will i

89
00:08:19,61 --> 00:08:26,25
get to them up you know like you keep
going and afterwards pull you know

90
00:08:26,25 --> 00:08:30,68
news on the staff holding.
You know work. You know

91
00:08:33,34 --> 00:08:39,49
that you're well about twenty
or thirty well that was that

92
00:08:40,39 --> 00:08:47,14
. There's only room for

93
00:08:47,14 --> 00:08:51,41
what you do in the lunch was there any
sort of fun and games used to go on in the

94
00:08:51,41 --> 00:08:58,27
workshop on which to get down going
down to the wharf and mako would

95
00:08:59,44 --> 00:09:05,87
do anything sharp and get the mackerel.
We could get ten for them. Do you mako.

96
00:09:06,53 --> 00:09:13,38
And some of the english boys they didn't
know what they were made by animals. For

97
00:09:13,39 --> 00:09:19,00
them and they must always get my fill.
Picking up on the angle with fire.

98
00:09:20,27 --> 00:09:20,65
That was

99
00:09:20,65 --> 00:09:27,95
a wide open fire. You know like and we put
the mussels on the top and bang beautiful

100
00:09:27,96 --> 00:09:34,91
tasty. Bit of an indoor toilets.
Yes it was good. Anything

101
00:09:34,91 --> 00:09:40,13
else you remember during the lunch era where
the place to go up in the well the big

102
00:09:40,13 --> 00:09:46,10
boat used to come in with the thiele. And
we go up all of us to seamen and they

103
00:09:46,10 --> 00:09:51,46
kill the sheep. Have a ceremony there
and then. When they have their meal

104
00:09:51,46 --> 00:09:57,25
a real big party. Let's have the big like

105
00:09:57,26 --> 00:10:03,53
a lebanese been you know that flat and
they just get it all into little time for

106
00:10:05,70 --> 00:10:11,62
. Did you go up the arch at all. Oh yes
you know i had to go up there. The little

107
00:10:11,62 --> 00:10:16,57
mite was only remarking we got
it up there and one of the

108
00:10:18,45 --> 00:10:23,70
plates. I found it was loose rivets. So we
had to take them down and we had to get

109
00:10:23,70 --> 00:10:30,58
it down. And we were over on the pylon on
the south pylon and the kind liven up the

110
00:10:30,58 --> 00:10:37,54
top wouldn't. Lola play down by gently
down we said will operate over you

111
00:10:37,55 --> 00:10:43,33
played well and willing to
take million. But we've got it

112
00:10:44,56 --> 00:10:51,33
. Was there many loose rivets.
Oh no. We picked it up again and

113
00:10:51,33 --> 00:10:57,32
i replaced the derivative alone job to
remember the inspectors marking rivets

114
00:10:57,32 --> 00:11:03,18
because our inspectors found it. You know
like and that's what they made it bring

115
00:11:03,18 --> 00:11:07,23
it down again. How did they cut the rivets
out in those days they didn't use oxy

116
00:11:07,23 --> 00:11:12,33
today. Now the only option that was
used on me would be. There was

117
00:11:12,33 --> 00:11:18,78
a maintenance chap he used to
pay you know i think not not

118
00:11:18,78 --> 00:11:25,70
kind of bring in time
with anyone he used to do

119
00:11:25,70 --> 00:11:32,36
all the odd jobs. And he could cover and
use anything to small welding jobs or

120
00:11:32,36 --> 00:11:37,82
anything like that but that's all we do
remember how they cut the rivets out then.

121
00:11:38,65 --> 00:11:45,06
Well i can't i'm out with a set a pneumatic
chisel and set. Oh yes i will i mean

122
00:11:45,06 --> 00:11:47,13
a big fridge and but i made

123
00:11:47,13 --> 00:11:52,54
a one time really came out recourse they
were tested in the shop and i have been

124
00:11:52,54 --> 00:11:58,98
and i mean anything anything at
all to grantland they were very

125
00:11:58,98 --> 00:12:05,97
particular specters very good men you
know like on the job. Do you remember

126
00:12:05,97 --> 00:12:10,41
if any of the holes were drilled wrongly
what happened to the steel then. Oh i

127
00:12:10,41 --> 00:12:16,49
would not know how long i mean because i
would check checked and double check and

128
00:12:17,97 --> 00:12:23,08
see the batteries of drill. I mean if they
were always piloted first part of how

129
00:12:24,58 --> 00:12:27,81
open they are you know. Yes
well i had heard about

130
00:12:27,81 --> 00:12:31,14
a few plates that were wrongly drilled and
they recommended up in the middle of the

131
00:12:31,14 --> 00:12:35,54
harbor or i could have
you don't admit stakes.

132
00:12:38,31 --> 00:12:44,18
I think could happen you know but there
wasn't too many. Yes. So they wouldn't let

133
00:12:44,18 --> 00:12:49,100
anything by regardless because all they
see the steel major the steel came from

134
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:56,92
middleboro and i mean it had to replace
that type of steel mill good height silicon

135
00:12:58,50 --> 00:13:02,10
do you remember whether any of the steel
was already drilled when it arrived well i

136
00:13:02,10 --> 00:13:07,18
know some of it must have been but do you
ever see any ready drill steel. I mean

137
00:13:07,18 --> 00:13:13,94
that most of the base and the time of the
ship they weren't drill where the little

138
00:13:13,94 --> 00:13:19,45
all build and all the marked building which
up the triangular buttress plates do

139
00:13:19,45 --> 00:13:25,25
you remember them arriving from overseas
already drilled. Oh well i could not to my

140
00:13:25,25 --> 00:13:30,61
knowledge anyway not my knowledge. Gemma
cutting and drilling them cutting and

141
00:13:30,61 --> 00:13:33,99
drilling the small triangular
batteries play it well they had

142
00:13:33,99 --> 00:13:38,46
a good machine if they
had copied and they had

143
00:13:38,46 --> 00:13:45,29
a big. The. Do you remember how the large

144
00:13:45,29 --> 00:13:49,10
plates were handled once they got into
the workshop or like time out directly.

145
00:13:49,44 --> 00:13:50,27
There was

146
00:13:50,27 --> 00:13:56,61
a big mangle and i mean that they were
straightened out and quick prediction

147
00:13:56,61 --> 00:14:02,39
trolls would be no kinks through anything.
It was all through the big mangled and i

148
00:14:02,39 --> 00:14:02,56
think

149
00:14:04,92 --> 00:14:10,25
a matter of. twenty and thirty feet long.
You know movement could be up to an inch

150
00:14:10,25 --> 00:14:10,35
and

151
00:14:10,35 --> 00:14:17,78
a half. Head of one trample on the angle
iron twelve twelve one inch angle

152
00:14:17,78 --> 00:14:19,22
loan. And i made

153
00:14:19,22 --> 00:14:25,91
a little to each square of it and
that tunnel held that now. To do

154
00:14:25,91 --> 00:14:28,18
just that about the only thing i had i had

155
00:14:28,18 --> 00:14:33,34
a particular cable. And of course i don't
know where that went with them bring some

156
00:14:33,34 --> 00:14:36,34
of my sisters. To took

157
00:14:36,34 --> 00:14:41,98
a moment i was something to the paperwork
properly. Do you remember also the angle

158
00:14:41,98 --> 00:14:47,95
crimping and the angle cutting machine.
Yes yes i mean it was all night caps and

159
00:14:47,95 --> 00:14:54,49
everything like that and the angle from
time about fire land that they used to job

160
00:14:54,49 --> 00:14:56,90
all the angles travel
more let's put a bit of

161
00:14:56,90 --> 00:15:02,56
a syringe to put them into the other section
you know keep and level. And that's

162
00:15:02,56 --> 00:15:08,74
the big gangle treat spyware we used to
the team at all from it. And at one time

163
00:15:10,65 --> 00:15:15,41
. They used to light the fire and
then crimp the angle to what to offer

164
00:15:18,34 --> 00:15:19,87
chocolate. It was just like

165
00:15:19,87 --> 00:15:26,67
a little set more or less set you cool.
But had to heated because out of all the

166
00:15:27,37 --> 00:15:34,32
the angles. You know you know
right. But could be said the

167
00:15:34,33 --> 00:15:39,75
same as the machine with a straight
and angled a big angle with just like

168
00:15:39,75 --> 00:15:46,72
a two to sort of believe
it's where they could widen

169
00:15:46,73 --> 00:15:52,71
the space and this them used to come in
and just gets enough. You know like the

170
00:15:52,71 --> 00:15:59,65
state may learn all that modern
machinery beautiful machine where

171
00:15:59,66 --> 00:16:05,04
did you live at that time when you working
on the bridge. I lived at park street

172
00:16:05,05 --> 00:16:11,96
control and then moved out to do
what they call you to call days evil

173
00:16:11,96 --> 00:16:18,62
now taking for. Long but i need to
get the tray me and frame into the

174
00:16:19,57 --> 00:16:26,22
way and get the whole fam down to the
key and then we used to get caught in

175
00:16:26,22 --> 00:16:32,97
a very easy get weekly ticket. And that
was and then for you know it to work with

176
00:16:32,97 --> 00:16:39,87
a good tech. You know like me
for really of the work we were

177
00:16:41,06 --> 00:16:44,23
plus a tech time. Plus the time it takes

178
00:16:45,47 --> 00:16:51,63
a country. Plus the time used to go to
tech as well as mine and that was just

179
00:16:52,40 --> 00:16:58,89
in our own time the tech. Examination
if we pass an examination we got to six

180
00:16:58,89 --> 00:17:03,45
rowers. And if you see the wages lift the

181
00:17:05,36 --> 00:17:12,21
7-eleven went to first see who you were
up there before it was closed where you

182
00:17:12,21 --> 00:17:18,45
and over the top. Oh yes yes kind
of course but we got we handed

183
00:17:20,89 --> 00:17:25,11
you to take is only three quarters of an
hour to get up. Where do you mean you've

184
00:17:25,11 --> 00:17:31,02
got wonder will we get into the
management. If we go up there anymore.

185
00:17:32,05 --> 00:17:37,23
We'd be you know weapon but
you actually got up the creek

186
00:17:37,23 --> 00:17:41,63
a crane and across the from one side to
the other kind. You know like they just

187
00:17:41,63 --> 00:17:47,01
almost to get them. We've got up there and
we could pull up my top of the time and

188
00:17:47,01 --> 00:17:52,60
come naming others. So you would actually
have got across the harbor before mr.

189
00:17:52,60 --> 00:17:57,65
Ennis crossed that bridge sure
years will be by how much

190
00:17:59,60 --> 00:18:05,11
a little anyway because they had to wait
for the right time for the june. I think

191
00:18:05,11 --> 00:18:10,48
was about two o'clock in the morning will.
They finally lock and when was what was

192
00:18:10,48 --> 00:18:14,43
it when you you youngsters
whenever i would never

193
00:18:17,63 --> 00:18:22,63
you want to have the cooperation of the
crane driver didn't you. You know until you

194
00:18:22,63 --> 00:18:26,21
see that lunch in the movie having

195
00:18:26,21 --> 00:18:33,20
a lunch. And cause that villain
to top the top one kind

196
00:18:35,64 --> 00:18:38,71
and how did you actually get across from
one crane to the other where you because

197
00:18:38,71 --> 00:18:45,71
you are very close. You know like
almost your own. But wriggling reboot

198
00:18:45,72 --> 00:18:50,81
and doing. So you break mr.

199
00:18:50,81 --> 00:18:55,63
Ennis but actually when you when
you see the one you can drive

200
00:18:55,63 --> 00:19:01,56
a car and over the top and i'm one
of the people they had a bit of

201
00:19:01,56 --> 00:19:06,88
a pathway. Will they might stay away. You
know for the workmen. Veteran that chap

202
00:19:06,88 --> 00:19:12,30
in the might and chap you know that was
all he was doing with my little steps and

203
00:19:12,30 --> 00:19:18,18
so forth. Do you remember the carpenters
making wooden ones before the steel was

204
00:19:18,18 --> 00:19:24,31
put up the steel steps now you know it
would be temper your mind. It wasn't true.

205
00:19:24,35 --> 00:19:31,24
Yea. The final tape you
know the gentleman is also

206
00:19:31,24 --> 00:19:34,14
a reverend and they used to build

207
00:19:34,14 --> 00:19:39,77
a little log precedent rifle and. Do you
remember any amusing things that happened

208
00:19:39,77 --> 00:19:44,87
while you were working there
amusing little english boy or not

209
00:19:44,87 --> 00:19:51,65
a boy i little english assembler to

210
00:19:51,66 --> 00:19:56,87
larrikin to give him every monday
morning they woke up showed

211
00:19:56,88 --> 00:20:03,26
a pipe and i signed you going to put
some money in for something. In the pub

212
00:20:04,30 --> 00:20:09,94
spin and it happened every monday
morning. Well i don't know

213
00:20:12,16 --> 00:20:19,04
any other things you know. Let me
think. A linguist married when he

214
00:20:19,04 --> 00:20:24,66
first came out he didn't know much
about the worries of our israeli

215
00:20:26,77 --> 00:20:32,47
tobacco only wanted to back down and he
told about the cigarette. I misread it.

216
00:20:38,14 --> 00:20:41,88
Pleasing to read it give him an

217
00:20:45,60 --> 00:20:52,42
edge. And say anything.
So he called me one

218
00:20:52,42 --> 00:20:56,75
day i was in my hands were
calling on behind me back. It's

219
00:20:56,75 --> 00:21:02,80
a charming moment. Jeremy
burley will only trouble up.

220
00:21:03,95 --> 00:21:10,75
Before knock off time people enough time
and i don't turn you about that big punch

221
00:21:10,75 --> 00:21:13,50
me shown the start. It was

222
00:21:13,50 --> 00:21:19,76
a little. Generator like and if
you pulled a bit quicker get

223
00:21:19,76 --> 00:21:21,56
a spark. And

224
00:21:21,56 --> 00:21:28,38
a big flash. Which get the other young
boys when they come and say stuff that up

225
00:21:28,38 --> 00:21:31,79
my mind to get behind
when he thought it was

226
00:21:31,79 --> 00:21:38,70
a rumor and given to shop and i being
the big flash of light. You know

227
00:21:38,70 --> 00:21:45,68
i like them for their
law. As all these things

228
00:21:45,68 --> 00:21:51,62
always go on in various jobs young
and we were only young for anything.

229
00:21:54,66 --> 00:21:57,43
Is there anything that sticks in your mind
over all these years. Do you remember

230
00:21:57,43 --> 00:22:01,78
for instance the day the arts was joined
you when we're getting. Yeah well today

231
00:22:01,78 --> 00:22:07,77
when we got. The canberra two shillings

232
00:22:08,89 --> 00:22:13,13
and we got to have a day of
to have a beer. That was mr.

233
00:22:13,13 --> 00:22:18,50
Freeman where where were you
when the bridge was opened.

234
00:22:19,96 --> 00:22:26,75
Down on the mine in remind of what you
know. Because the crowd you know crowd

235
00:22:26,75 --> 00:22:32,82
only bridge. You know i think for me

236
00:22:33,63 --> 00:22:40,16
what from the media will be down.

237
00:22:41,47 --> 00:22:48,38
To the material around him were one of
the birds probably in the family work of

238
00:22:48,38 --> 00:22:54,60
my you know i ring was there
in sydney or in the sydney

239
00:22:54,60 --> 00:22:55,88
intrigued me really

240
00:23:01,75 --> 00:23:02,24
chappy had

241
00:23:02,24 --> 00:23:08,81
a particular time about five or six men
working for him lead to drill only big cult

242
00:23:10,04 --> 00:23:12,51
big club and do

243
00:23:12,51 --> 00:23:17,52
a bit of trouble when we can.

244
00:23:20,04 --> 00:23:26,02
Well. Where was his workshop.
Eligible relatively neutral

245
00:23:27,60 --> 00:23:31,43
. Maybe liberal without

246
00:23:31,44 --> 00:23:36,51
a military blurb in them and made him

247
00:23:38,57 --> 00:23:39,00
rich up

248
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:44,65
a little liberty bitch but i wound up in
my little big challenge and they told us

249
00:23:44,65 --> 00:23:50,79
to be middle of the little by religion
illegal. Climate and everything like that.

250
00:23:50,99 --> 00:23:55,53
You know my little premature. Liberal before
bill will be the really feel terrible

251
00:23:58,26 --> 00:24:04,48
thing to remember that it was him he helped
you. You helped me before you went on

252
00:24:04,48 --> 00:24:10,91
the premise that there be no global crime
each claiming to believe but the blimp.

253
00:24:13,91 --> 00:24:20,56
Will be rebuilt lebanon and all it
will it. But my duties will lead.

254
00:24:21,87 --> 00:24:25,29
But for the bits of evidence. It was you
and i might be able to be above the bridge

255
00:24:25,29 --> 00:24:31,49
when that would be trouble
between publicly but

256
00:24:35,02 --> 00:24:39,60
between bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla probably clipped

257
00:24:39,60 --> 00:24:46,40
the public liberty club deliberately.
The problem will be able

258
00:24:46,41 --> 00:24:53,21
to do it. And it may be mel gibson liberal

259
00:24:56,07 --> 00:25:03,05
. But tibbs prepped probably but the public
probably will be able to predict what

260
00:25:03,06 --> 00:25:08,43
it will be but. I think

261
00:25:08,44 --> 00:25:14,84
a lot of it will be the main thing the
blow moment trying to work at press

262
00:25:16,80 --> 00:25:22,56
time around. I remember it will it
mean for the gallery but the read to

263
00:25:22,57 --> 00:25:23,10
a repertory.

264
00:25:30,64 --> 00:25:34,99
Every relate with really rebel
women women about everyone most of

265
00:25:38,47 --> 00:25:39,62
them when police put

266
00:25:40,46 --> 00:25:48,66
a bullet. To

267
00:25:48,67 --> 00:25:54,57
him every restaurant programs we
milled around some of them rebels

268
00:25:55,86 --> 00:25:58,26
the rebels the rebels globally maybe

269
00:25:58,26 --> 00:26:04,57
a little believed by rebels.

270
00:26:04,59 --> 00:26:10,75
To recuperate with ms phelps like it
would. When people remember when the real

271
00:26:12,08 --> 00:26:18,81
winner but what remained of politely
showed up there. Exactly who else was

272
00:26:18,81 --> 00:26:25,74
working around their. O levels.
The elder the elder spent

273
00:26:25,74 --> 00:26:30,63
a long time. Well it was only with
alec stewart. And then there was

274
00:26:30,64 --> 00:26:37,34
a jimmy berman's woman and they really
appendages. But they were different. Alec

275
00:26:38,11 --> 00:26:44,24
will work that it's all good but when. But
then on the threat level charlie blaming

276
00:26:44,24 --> 00:26:47,47
only the inferior was

277
00:26:47,47 --> 00:26:54,44
a panel of men. We wish to to
love and i think you have edge in

278
00:26:54,44 --> 00:26:58,26
terribly lightly that i
work on the opposite. So

279
00:26:58,26 --> 00:27:04,94
a lot like that between didn't actually

280
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:12,47
. Company. We're just separate clicks.

281
00:27:13,51 --> 00:27:15,07
Yes well as

282
00:27:15,08 --> 00:27:18,71
a matter of having accuracy with which he
remarks and we drillers drill this was

283
00:27:18,71 --> 00:27:25,26
really remarkable. Or chilly here is our
mind but finally said to me. Should we

284
00:27:25,26 --> 00:27:31,12
have to be congratulated. And we've got
we've got good marks on the wreck and none

285
00:27:31,12 --> 00:27:35,62
of the hole had to be reamed or anything
they would get right on the spot.
