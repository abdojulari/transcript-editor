1
00:00:02,72 --> 00:00:11,11
To Mister Reg Saunders, who worked as a youth and apprentice stonemason at the quarry at Maria during the building.

2
00:00:11,11 --> 00:00:21,03
The Sydney Harbour Bridge do remember first getting the job done solace yes and buried the Richard Park.

3
00:00:21,03 --> 00:00:30,05
I was induced to I was induced to undertake the five-year apprenticeship on my father 's advice.

4
00:00:30,05 --> 00:00:39,44
For this reason that there is life were consisted of the arduous labour a how he had no trade

5
00:00:39,44 --> 00:00:47,78
and who used to say to me that traits and have the great advantage over the ordinary labourer

6
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:54,09
and the tea therefore suggested that I be one of one of the year.

7
00:00:54,09 --> 00:00:55,82
A number of boys

8
00:00:55,82 --> 00:01:05,04
but would undertake an apprenticeship to become a granite Mason did you live down there before the view I opened it in.

9
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:08,32
I am a native of Maria farm.

10
00:01:08,32 --> 00:01:21,09
My father was the morning Maria in the year eighteen seventy three and I was born in the year nineteen hundred

11
00:01:21,09 --> 00:01:27,9
and nine, which makes me in my early seventies today,

12
00:01:27,9 --> 00:01:41,54
particularly the quarry of media normal along with the executive body are publicised in the local press are the

13
00:01:41,54 --> 00:01:54,44
opportunity of learning the granite trade founder several of my schoolmates responded together with myself,

14
00:01:54,44 --> 00:01:58,23
founder for a year.

15
00:01:58,23 --> 00:02:10,23
The first procedure was to have ourselves legally examined to see if our lungs were sufficiently strong to stand up to

16
00:02:10,23 --> 00:02:18,83
the arduous labour that was in nineteen twenty seven, was it I would say you are nineteen twenty six.

17
00:02:18,83 --> 00:02:24,88
I actually started my apprenticeship in nineteen twenty six, together with the all the other boys,

18
00:02:24,88 --> 00:02:27,59
that was the year that the year, workers compensation came in

19
00:02:27,59 --> 00:02:33,48
and that the rule is the rule that you are getting lemon between Intertrade Lachmann of illicit letters are interesting

20
00:02:33,48 --> 00:02:33,91
to me.

21
00:02:33,91 --> 00:02:39,61
I did not serve no lap to until the rich adjuster mentioned it to me,

22
00:02:39,61 --> 00:02:48,3
but it is imperative that day of the health of the men in the various trades be so protected under place

23
00:02:48,3 --> 00:02:58,4
and we boys upto local doctor to be passed is medically fit to undertake the arduous trade to member starting what you

24
00:02:58,4 --> 00:03:05,96
have to do in the first place when you started the leader of the initiation of the word,

25
00:03:05,96 --> 00:03:18,74
the initiation of a stonemason is a bloody business excuse my using media, an Australian colloquialism.

26
00:03:18,74 --> 00:03:26,44
It was a bloody business in this regard, but after the first skill

27
00:03:26,59 --> 00:03:32,26
but was necessary was to be able to strike are the tool.

28
00:03:32,26 --> 00:03:32,96
I will punch

29
00:03:32,96 --> 00:03:44,65
or chisel the strike at our weather for pound hammer they were the idea of making some impression on the granite well

30
00:03:44,71 --> 00:03:52,9
you were conformed truly instruction of the master mason than you went at it well.

31
00:03:52,9 --> 00:04:01,05
It is a most awkward thing to learn the ABC of anything in the biggest problem was allowed to hit the head of that

32
00:04:01,05 --> 00:04:06,68
punch or chisel or a pure rudeness member, you would get a go on

33
00:04:06,85 --> 00:04:14,98
and you'd get more confident than the more confident you became the harder you would hit until a critical moment would

34
00:04:14,98 --> 00:04:20,42
the crop up when instead of hitting the head of the punts you would mess and hit your hand

35
00:04:20,47 --> 00:04:28,62
and hence my use of the word bloody because he would not propitious skin off your hand as big as a shilling piece

36
00:04:28,62 --> 00:04:40,11
and the blood would the flow profusely so get all over your tool and all over your hand founder of the matter of fact,

37
00:04:40,11 --> 00:04:48,7
I nearly fainted the first shock of IMC by having myself with this hammer and furthermore,

38
00:04:48,7 --> 00:04:53,66
though the initiation period would go on to say three months.

39
00:04:53,66 --> 00:04:56,83
In other words, you would never be sure of hitting the head of that tool.

40
00:04:56,83 --> 00:05:05,75
Until three months have elapsed, and even then you would sometimes miss and the pram

41
00:05:05,75 --> 00:05:13,18
but have been lacerated previously would have been healing up nicely and all of a sudden you would bash it

42
00:05:13,44 --> 00:05:21,18
and opened up again and that was the excruciating point of use and Lilly make me think that the pain.

43
00:05:21,18 --> 00:05:25,89
Hence my initiation was a first aid, therefore, that the thing.

44
00:05:25,89 --> 00:05:29,41
Yes, indeed, founder of

45
00:05:29,41 --> 00:05:41,15
or your attention to an incident which I actually saw happen working opposite me was one of the original Masons it came

46
00:05:41,15 --> 00:05:49,44
over from the big horn country of Canada, whose name is George Wharton Scotchman, full-blooded

47
00:05:49,44 --> 00:05:57,23
and George was one day are standing on his per block of granite up on its end

48
00:05:57,34 --> 00:06:07,38
and the electric crane driver have the list tonnage or are suspended Faye about a foot off the ground

49
00:06:07,38 --> 00:06:16,3
and George want placing a block underneath the endless bone in order to get a good it properly settle down

50
00:06:17,43 --> 00:06:23,05
and the dogs came out and George, instead of having his plans and four

51
00:06:23,05 --> 00:06:30,31
and on the block of wood who have one hand over the top of the block in one and underneath and

52
00:06:30,31 --> 00:06:35,38
when the dogs came out the stone came down and onto his hand

53
00:06:35,39 --> 00:06:42,96
and I saw George is swinging back away from the falling stone a holding his hand,

54
00:06:42,96 --> 00:06:51,59
and one of his fingers have been crushed off allowed yours was in was a man of over fifty I been over sixty,

55
00:06:51,59 --> 00:07:00,31
yet the fortitude of that man amazed me because he walked down to the first aid to which Richard has just referred

56
00:07:00,31 --> 00:07:07,99
people download first aid are stationed about a distance of four five hundred yards holding his crushed finger

57
00:07:08,71 --> 00:07:14,39
and no sign of going out to it as an expression GÃ¶del.

58
00:07:14,39 --> 00:07:20,93
Finding no decision out of our next city get involved in any yourself.

59
00:07:20,93 --> 00:07:26,59
I know I I didn't get involved in any bad ones,

60
00:07:26,59 --> 00:07:33,7
but on my finger here I'll draw Richards attention to a scar on my finger where you can see,

61
00:07:33,7 --> 00:07:41,56
it are rigid scar set that wide scar ball on this particular day I was holding a cool

62
00:07:42,36 --> 00:07:49,69
and my fellow apprentice was striking the head of this tool and the EU the granite

63
00:07:49,69 --> 00:07:52,55
or the suddenly all of a sudden burst

64
00:07:52,96 --> 00:08:00,21
and the piece went up in their I held my right hand over my head to protect my head.

65
00:08:00,21 --> 00:08:10,03
Her that the the brownish got my finger, which was rushed been the handle of the stool hourly of the scar until list,

66
00:08:10,03 --> 00:08:11,27
they look at it.

67
00:08:11,27 --> 00:08:21,93
It almost got my finger off, what a minor incident has sidelined concern I like now to refer to our an accident,

68
00:08:21,93 --> 00:08:24,3
but a tragic accident.

69
00:08:24,3 --> 00:08:29,94
I remember vividly you are the circumstances of an accident,

70
00:08:29,94 --> 00:08:40,98
a fatal accident that occurred in the face of the quality of my brother in law mainly George what the Scotchman was

71
00:08:40,98 --> 00:08:46,46
working with a number of his mates and under there was no year,

72
00:08:46,46 --> 00:08:57,45
a huge block of granite are up on alleged it had been blasted out the ready for the dimension cutters on the floor of a

73
00:08:57,45 --> 00:09:06,35
quarry and all of a sudden something caused this block of granite to lose its equilibrium and it fell it fell down

74
00:09:06,35 --> 00:09:14,86
and as it did so are my brother-in-law is make namely that Percy Poole and incidentally,

75
00:09:14,86 --> 00:09:20,65
Mister Percy Poole 's name is record of on the plight of the northern pylon

76
00:09:20,65 --> 00:09:33,14
and one of those men who were was killed her in the Maria quarry rollout of a policy pool didn't get away from the face

77
00:09:33,14 --> 00:09:39,32
of the quarry quick enough Easter back against the face, thinking it could avoid the tonnage of branded

78
00:09:39,32 --> 00:09:44,96
and still that the granite fell back on him crushed him against the face.

79
00:09:44,96 --> 00:09:52,05
My brother-in-law George what was a young young Mandela not after before his wage depict Percy Poole up

80
00:09:52,05 --> 00:09:54,25
and carried him out of the face.

81
00:09:54,25 --> 00:10:02,46
The other was a tragic accident shall just referred to without a fatal accident at the quarry another fatal accident

82
00:10:02,46 --> 00:10:16,81
was to one on the crimes that was driven by a Scotchman named Joe 's civil rights are his dog man was a contemporary of

83
00:10:16,81 --> 00:10:21,79
my fathers Mister Morton hurry water

84
00:10:21,79 --> 00:10:31,25
or hurry waters was riding on media leader body of the tray of the crying in a under some right.

85
00:10:31,25 --> 00:10:37,84
Didn't see him sitting there and set right the Swanley, you claim around at a given point

86
00:10:37,84 --> 00:10:52,41
and the Mister Waters was crushed his side a was crushed and that was another major accident, Germany. Other ones.

87
00:10:52,41 --> 00:11:01,92
Not that I can call there were surprisingly few accident at the Maria Quarry can remember what term what your job was

88
00:11:01,92 --> 00:11:03,21
whether you are a bit

89
00:11:03,21 --> 00:11:10,89
and printers they could you explain it publisher what I've been longing to do because there has been a great deal of

90
00:11:10,89 --> 00:11:17,12
publicity concerning the steel work over construction of the bridge, but little

91
00:11:17,12 --> 00:11:26,48
or nothing has been set down all spoke on concerning the actual learn processing of the granite in Maria

92
00:11:26,54 --> 00:11:31,16
and this is what I've been longing to do the eye

93
00:11:31,16 --> 00:11:39,9
but better go back to where I have to describe the actual acquiring of the skill of striking the tool without missing

94
00:11:39,9 --> 00:11:42,3
it.

95
00:11:42,3 --> 00:11:48,93
I was about to describe more extensively part of the initiation

96
00:11:49,29 --> 00:12:05,39
and it suits a bloody year are well low effects on the apprentice will now in the sheds are our first own world lined

97
00:12:05,39 --> 00:12:14,87
up twelve feet apart and are there were four rows of men.

98
00:12:14,87 --> 00:12:18,06
There were two sheds and four rows of men,

99
00:12:18,06 --> 00:12:29,02
and there were four are compromised their to this I would say these tube would be about six inches in diameter hours

100
00:12:29,02 --> 00:12:33,6
tubes around the full length of this shed was the sheds

101
00:12:33,6 --> 00:12:39,26
and from those to reserve was extended to each individual Mason,

102
00:12:39,26 --> 00:12:48,51
a rubber hose onto which he could screw his pneumatic tools.

103
00:12:48,51 --> 00:12:56,7
I'd like to emphasise that they'd is practically impossible to work granite unless you have pneumatic tools they are

104
00:12:56,7 --> 00:13:08,54
under this was the year of the technique employed by the Masons in their leave the mention the leading quarry man was a

105
00:13:08,54 --> 00:13:17,22
like a leaving dimension cutter he would doubt reduce the block of granite that had been blown down into the floor of

106
00:13:17,22 --> 00:13:27,18
Macquarie, he would reduce it and get from that block of granite, a maximum number of style with a minimum of waste

107
00:13:27,19 --> 00:13:32,71
when and how to achieve that end he would mark was stung by the number on the stone

108
00:13:32,71 --> 00:13:37,81
and the steam train would pick up start up

109
00:13:37,81 --> 00:13:45,98
and carry it to a end of the shed where it would be picked up by one of the electric cranes and courage down

110
00:13:45,98 --> 00:13:57,02
and deposit into what ever Banker are was empty in which the Mason operated every mason had his own particular optical

111
00:13:57,02 --> 00:14:09,26
banker well what was a bank Banco make or a position position every man nerve respectively on Banco hiccup to it

112
00:14:09,26 --> 00:14:16,86
and the penalties up his own set of tools were which he valued very much

113
00:14:16,86 --> 00:14:22,97
and the lists granite block around would be deposited in his banker

114
00:14:22,97 --> 00:14:27,75
and over the next procedure would be the shed for the shed.

115
00:14:27,75 --> 00:14:37,43
Former owner owner Mister Hatton trick to click on May he was the brother in law of the drama leading draft man who

116
00:14:37,43 --> 00:14:44,33
name with William Mollison well that in effect would bring to this particular Mason,

117
00:14:44,33 --> 00:14:48,66
a design that have been drafted by his brother-in-law in the office

118
00:14:48,66 --> 00:14:53,44
and he will hand up the design over to the motion and the motion would proceed.

119
00:14:53,44 --> 00:14:55,78
Accordingly,

120
00:14:55,78 --> 00:15:02,25
as amended all the stones were different all-weather number the same of there were a number the same that what was the

121
00:15:02,25 --> 00:15:04,08
sickening monopoly on the trade.

122
00:15:04,08 --> 00:15:12,01
The repetition that very little variety us what that's what got my goat to use a common expression.

123
00:15:12,01 --> 00:15:19,48
The sickening monotony of one stone after another, and the arduous labour is a deadly at it it Worley down

124
00:15:19,48 --> 00:15:24,77
and broke my heart was also nurses said they were restarted different.

125
00:15:24,77 --> 00:15:27,96
I don't know quite what to not every style,

126
00:15:27,96 --> 00:15:36,84
learned a lot depends upon the change in the architecture if we refer the architecture of a year structure is very

127
00:15:36,84 --> 00:15:37,78
varied.

128
00:15:37,78 --> 00:15:44,58
Well needless to say the stones that would be cut accordingly would vary to,

129
00:15:44,58 --> 00:15:55,78
but you can see for yourself the continuity of their face work on the pylons is very much the same known for many many

130
00:15:55,78 --> 00:15:59,61
courses before Gazza before any change is us.

131
00:15:59,61 --> 00:16:05,72
It is about mornings but five or six different bangles of to places, but to have quite a lot to get it now.

132
00:16:05,72 --> 00:16:15,69
Our fellows before our leave the stoned trade is undoubtedly one of the oldest of trades

133
00:16:15,69 --> 00:16:22,69
and was nothing set bounding the textbooks from which you could learn to become a Mason,

134
00:16:22,69 --> 00:16:31,6
you had to learn in practically you have to go to the Mason himself and learn the skill of handling the tools

135
00:16:31,6 --> 00:16:32,99
and so forth.

136
00:16:32,99 --> 00:16:44,39
While now in this masonry trade one of the fundamental principles the basic principle in fact was to be able to do so

137
00:16:44,39 --> 00:16:48,7
create a given plane.

138
00:16:48,7 --> 00:16:53,16
It have to be as near as possible

139
00:16:53,16 --> 00:17:01,33
and the to-do lists the Scotsman uses a well son would not attract the twist out of the start on the coast meant that

140
00:17:01,33 --> 00:17:02,17
the earth.

141
00:17:02,17 --> 00:17:08,32
The facial was known or she were going to create this given plane like a table top floor bump interest

142
00:17:08,32 --> 00:17:09,57
and so forth were for you.

143
00:17:09,57 --> 00:17:14,07
How to create that given plane because the whole accuracy of this dull

144
00:17:14,07 --> 00:17:19,59
and dependent upon the creation of that original plan.

145
00:17:19,59 --> 00:17:25,67
The foreman stonemason who cut the starting tool world usable blocks to use her hammer

146
00:17:25,67 --> 00:17:29,55
and which is auditing also use soars all the

147
00:17:29,66 --> 00:17:39,8
or what well immediately form in the mason in the quarry unity was what are called early the leading her quarrymen on

148
00:17:39,8 --> 00:17:46,14
Imam dimension cutter far as he was given certain specifications of the hat.

149
00:17:46,14 --> 00:17:54,91
The work to pander seaward over the drop the Lions when I say drop the lines they use a chalk line is

150
00:17:54,91 --> 00:18:03,46
and they will drop a line from top to bottom on this line would rob virtual red chalk on alignment drop the line the on

151
00:18:03,46 --> 00:18:04,72
the lion,

152
00:18:04,72 --> 00:18:16,2
the media are drilled men Macquarie men use of more series of holes light Asus thousands of whole use of the board

153
00:18:16,2 --> 00:18:28,49
leaseholds would be saved four inches deep by a diameter would you be so pass your first finger bound around the these

154
00:18:28,49 --> 00:18:38,89
holes were bored safe four inches apart light on the line now injury each individual hole was placed to this day you

155
00:18:38,89 --> 00:18:44,82
will are feathers they were flat on one side and oval on the other male.

156
00:18:44,82 --> 00:18:51,76
The quarry mound would insert in between those feathers up like a steel plaque that fitted neatly and

157
00:18:51,76 --> 00:18:56,96
when he got all these who was unplugged lined up he within start with the town hammer

158
00:18:56,96 --> 00:19:05,43
and tighten up many would pick up for of, say, six pounds six pound hammer and would begin to strike more heavily well,

159
00:19:05,43 --> 00:19:14,95
it was it was it was magnificent to see the effects of the pressure of loaf plugs struck uniformly

160
00:19:14,95 --> 00:19:20,59
and how those plugs and fellas would open up the granite and the split would go down six and eight

161
00:19:20,59 --> 00:19:23,15
and ten foot deep longer.

162
00:19:23,15 --> 00:19:35,48
This process take one jot are well its father 's determined mapped there would be perhaps three

163
00:19:35,48 --> 00:19:41,6
or four men clear for machines to working on the one big block of granite under the light directional relieving the

164
00:19:41,6 --> 00:19:49,22
dimension cut by sewage ministry several of her hitting their feathers in yet several several of them would be boring

165
00:19:49,22 --> 00:19:51,97
the holes and inserting these plugs

166
00:19:51,97 --> 00:19:57,78
and feathers so according to a predetermined lines by the leading a dimension cutter.

167
00:19:57,78 --> 00:19:59,5
but In blast at all the Macquarie

168
00:19:59,55 --> 00:20:11,12
but no other tunnel unless a court further away required the are embellished to be crushed by the big crusher,

169
00:20:11,12 --> 00:20:15,08
which was operating on the floor of the quarry.

170
00:20:15,08 --> 00:20:22,2
They used to have held such blasting in the in the font Forum McQuarrie, but this was done during the meal out

171
00:20:22,2 --> 00:20:27,89
when all other men were away out of the quarry and was safely a precaution adopted

172
00:20:27,89 --> 00:20:34,00
and they were bought at individual hole in each of these big dollars pieces and loaded with dynamite

173
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:37,78
and you would have a series of explosions in the quarry during the lunch hour

174
00:20:37,78 --> 00:20:46,42
and this would break up Leo waste which was beat would be transported and put into the big crusher in the bed of hot,

175
00:20:46,42 --> 00:20:49,89
but in so. In fact be the blocks that you made the forty thousand.

176
00:20:49,89 --> 00:20:55,27
Block that you made were not actively blasted out at all originally.

177
00:20:55,27 --> 00:21:02,75
They are the material from which they were made the ruling material was blasted out of the facelift facial McQuarrie

178
00:21:02,75 --> 00:21:12,05
and that was the that was the only year in the skill of the quarryman to get out of bigger big a piece of granite out

179
00:21:12,05 --> 00:21:21,1
of the face without shattering it so that when the dimensions cutters started to work on.

180
00:21:21,1 --> 00:21:28,93
They were no faults would you remember then they are the cutting of the two thousand tonne block for the year,

181
00:21:28,93 --> 00:21:36,38
Senator Arthur Martin Place, yes indeed, so I, I was walking in the quarry are

182
00:21:36,38 --> 00:21:44,17
when the latter are block of granite was especially blowing out of the face

183
00:21:44,8 --> 00:21:56,8
and it was that large media steam crane operating on the floor of the quarry couldn't to her hand with do very well,

184
00:21:56,8 --> 00:22:05,43
but nevertheless they didn't send our Mason out of the shed to work that the solid laughs bone on the floor of the

185
00:22:05,43 --> 00:22:16,81
quantity and whose name was an Italian Calder 's Europe want to Europe want Dick Q.

186
00:22:16,81 --> 00:22:19,84
Did she old knew him well

187
00:22:20,24 --> 00:22:28,86
and I'm oh describe someone about this mounted as of specific interest to smoked in are like a furnace

188
00:22:28,86 --> 00:22:41,12
and who couldn't he couldn't to get sufficient satisfaction out of smoking his though extremely strong pipe to use to

189
00:22:41,59 --> 00:22:45,2
one end you could be quite a way to cool for a while.

190
00:22:45,2 --> 00:22:50,54
It would take his penknife and the pickup in his pipe and out of the bottom of the bowl of the pipe,

191
00:22:50,54 --> 00:22:58,16
he would do this saturated nicotine saturated director of tobacco and into his hand.

192
00:22:58,16 --> 00:23:02,5
He put that and make it into a ball, London: in his mouth

193
00:23:02,5 --> 00:23:11,79
and chill it now that nicotine DIY I've given you understand there's enough to turn our lizard or ago and only back,

194
00:23:11,79 --> 00:23:16,68
but it had no effect contribute your what proportion of Italians were there.

195
00:23:16,68 --> 00:23:23,15
There were proportionately speaking very small, then the sum of the universe.

196
00:23:23,15 --> 00:23:30,34
The writings I have done on this subject are in fact to make myself quite accurate on my subject.

197
00:23:30,34 --> 00:23:32,88
I looked into the old photographs

198
00:23:32,88 --> 00:23:40,79
and I know these Italian as I knew these Battalion as well as I do have a note on what my on face

199
00:23:40,79 --> 00:23:44,4
and I counted twenty twenty Italians,

200
00:23:44,4 --> 00:23:58,07
the great majority of them were in a full-blooded Scotchman Pamela Scott well independent evidence is very often more

201
00:23:58,07 --> 00:23:59,41
impressive.

202
00:23:59,41 --> 00:24:08,16
My friend of Mister Kohl factions to Bob cold fax this open, but they were one hundred and on that one hundred

203
00:24:08,16 --> 00:24:15,00
and there were twenty. At least Italians right sale via the balance would be Australian.

204
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:16,62
There were very,

205
00:24:16,62 --> 00:24:26,57
very few the Italian are rather Australian masons might in our half a dozen that Australian masons are the lady who

206
00:24:26,57 --> 00:24:33,08
worked in the office bearer holiday are that in Sydney. She used to do the wages source user checked wages familiar.

207
00:24:33,08 --> 00:24:39,08
She seems to remember that there was round about two hundred and fifty colour faxes got tea reckons two hundred

208
00:24:39,08 --> 00:24:46,45
and forty altogether, only at the quarry are on the general sort of opinion was that they were split three ways,

209
00:24:46,45 --> 00:24:55,39
but you will reckon that they were less in actual fact are less Italians on the twenty yes,

210
00:24:55,39 --> 00:24:58,32
I'll do you remember our home.

211
00:24:58,32 --> 00:24:58,92
The Scotsman

212
00:24:58,92 --> 00:25:08,65
and the families of the Scots people came out indeed I do because those years were the formative years of my life.

213
00:25:08,65 --> 00:25:17,97
We're impressionable years are my parents had the broken up their marriage

214
00:25:17,97 --> 00:25:24,32
and are our family had been split up to the mercy of the waves under my father

215
00:25:24,32 --> 00:25:33,51
and I were living well batching together by under my life seemed to be a continuous negation.

216
00:25:33,51 --> 00:25:43,86
I was deprived of the natural fiction that day the sun will expect from our mother deprived of that and are oh

217
00:25:43,86 --> 00:25:54,1
when I had the the opportunity of socialising with these Scotch people in their downfalls and so forth.

218
00:25:54,1 --> 00:26:09,15
Many of those women used to thought of our well so are my ear the conference by under it was then that the I felt that

219
00:26:09,15 --> 00:26:22,27
life was worth living idea began to realise that the life was not as a barrier as Sir, I had anticipated.

220
00:26:22,27 --> 00:26:35,73
In fact I can safely say that Dana via example of the Scotch people are influenced my life form that they still less.

221
00:26:35,73 --> 00:26:47,5
I look upon the Scottish people as being people of sterling qualities splendid moral characters do remember the year

222
00:26:47,5 --> 00:26:56,69
Caledonian Society dancers than the collapse of the largest briefly touching on, though I well remember them when

223
00:26:56,69 --> 00:27:02,28
when laypeople settled at paragraph Talbot was the name of their village.

224
00:27:02,28 --> 00:27:13,34
They have no were whole or in which they could carry on their functions and so on a Friday night at least once a month,

225
00:27:13,34 --> 00:27:17,82
they would have a Caledonian Society Downs up in Maria Tao

226
00:27:18,47 --> 00:27:27,86
and it was a grandiose site to see these people going through all the violations of these Scotch dancers are similar

227
00:27:27,86 --> 00:27:38,94
gases were well outstrip the willow the eightsome reel before some real the Highland fling you learn to do it is our

228
00:27:38,94 --> 00:27:42,1
RDI on our aim is simply to too complicated.

229
00:27:42,1 --> 00:27:50,73
They were figured answers are no too complicated for me there highlands shot these will another undersea these people

230
00:27:50,73 --> 00:27:56,28
at their age as many of them almost problem were middle-aged people and older,

231
00:27:56,28 --> 00:28:05,48
and to see these people dancing furiously the way they did reminds me of product our raw Robert Burns 's poem,

232
00:28:05,48 --> 00:28:14,54
the Tamil Shanter where the situation is described very, very vividly I sought an actual life, Germany,

233
00:28:14,54 --> 00:28:20,72
humorous stories about very earned the quarry are those well,

234
00:28:20,72 --> 00:28:32,15
I don't remember many are not my friend Mister Kohl faction relates in his history, namely memory lane.

235
00:28:32,15 --> 00:28:43,79
He relates is drawing their about her Scotchman who had below on his own idea of receiving his our wages less rent that

236
00:28:43,79 --> 00:28:47,84
it had to pay, but I can't go into detail about that.

237
00:28:47,84 --> 00:28:51,75
It is all embodied in Mister Cole faxes story memory lane,

238
00:28:51,75 --> 00:28:59,31
but I will mention one little liar our incident that happened to me personally I was working away one day there are

239
00:28:59,31 --> 00:29:01,12
structural and came up to me

240
00:29:01,71 --> 00:29:15,46
and instead be on all what I did Nick Chin man signing power shall I don't voice ideogram were like terminate,

241
00:29:15,46 --> 00:29:18,25
you know. Do you know what it may have been about them.

242
00:29:18,25 --> 00:29:19,85
Yes, I know very well now,

243
00:29:19,85 --> 00:29:29,35
having studied Robert Burns were so many years quite familiar with the structure of the language various to you can now

244
00:29:29,35 --> 00:29:34,07
getting Tommy given the working conditions down there and around the grief

245
00:29:34,07 --> 00:29:38,62
and in the stern dressing sheds only too well either gone and into that one.

246
00:29:38,62 --> 00:29:48,51
I was so describing how to create a given plan from which the rest of the stone is Sir are made from right part you had

247
00:29:48,51 --> 00:29:56,66
to set up on each corner of the Stalin a position with your hammer niches will you would create this position on the

248
00:29:56,66 --> 00:30:06,56
four corners of the stone and on each of these corners were we were given a steel to slow twelve inches high

249
00:30:06,56 --> 00:30:10,45
and always the little before parishioners deal will exactly the same height

250
00:30:10,45 --> 00:30:19,51
and how to put them on the zircons of the stone founder recall pegs across these packs were put straight edges found

251
00:30:20,9 --> 00:30:24,84
the object was to create three positions on the staff

252
00:30:25,21 --> 00:30:32,44
and before one at the beat adjusted according to the other three so you would get go on in the end of look at

253
00:30:32,44 --> 00:30:40,63
illustrated edges under you would get the straightahead should by repeatedly chilling this particular was the third

254
00:30:40,63 --> 00:30:47,45
or other fourth position by comfortably repeatedly mentioning it down go down gradually,

255
00:30:47,45 --> 00:30:51,37
and finally getting your pneumatics you'll underwritten being inaccurately

256
00:30:51,37 --> 00:30:59,67
and by looking only at the straight edges from time to time you will ultimately get those all corners of on the stone

257
00:30:59,67 --> 00:31:05,91
accurate than you were ready to start drafting between the points

258
00:31:05,91 --> 00:31:15,03
and that was important point you have to create a draft all around us down form of this given plane to listen so forth

259
00:31:15,08 --> 00:31:21,51
with your punch first to get the rough off after the punch of big up your hands is all the hammer

260
00:31:21,51 --> 00:31:29,46
and you would take the draft flew a hand chiselled lineal took them down and even you would take your pneumatic tool.

261
00:31:29,46 --> 00:31:32,05
I was missed that teachers would use it up in it

262
00:31:32,05 --> 00:31:39,33
and then you wouldn't take that third draft down with the pneumatic chisel right down working constantly with the

263
00:31:39,33 --> 00:31:43,24
straight edge which would be created all around the stumble

264
00:31:43,24 --> 00:31:49,72
and about those overdraft around you had a big heap of what you perceive

265
00:31:49,72 --> 00:31:55,97
and how much rock you had to get off to get down to that that given plain

266
00:31:56,08 --> 00:31:59,89
and that it sometimes is of that was astounded to be that rough,

267
00:31:59,89 --> 00:32:13,29
we shall have to get the drilling machine on what are some rough water first founder loom are frequently those stones

268
00:32:13,74 --> 00:32:23,48
will in in most cases though stones were sent out drafted out into this surfacing machine area where all the rock was

269
00:32:23,48 --> 00:32:33,88
taken off by a big surf fishing machine that operate on alarm operator mama arm in this arm could provide around on

270
00:32:33,88 --> 00:32:39,44
this vertical spindle and the pneumatic tool was about six is injured inches in diameter.

271
00:32:39,44 --> 00:32:43,42
It was controlled by the operator to any position on that surface

272
00:32:43,42 --> 00:32:48,41
and the gradually he would wear it all down with a special tool,

273
00:32:48,41 --> 00:32:52,93
which was inserted in the head of the pneumatic tool called a four.

274
00:32:53,35 --> 00:33:02,68
List for point was tempered by the tool sharps in the blacksmith shop in such a way that the points would not snap

275
00:33:02,68 --> 00:33:08,47
and therefore the operator would push the machine at all over this surface

276
00:33:08,47 --> 00:33:11,66
and taken take new gradually down to the draft

277
00:33:11,9 --> 00:33:20,94
and finally he would put in in the in the pneumatic tool in lieu of the four-point who put for cuts before cut out for

278
00:33:20,94 --> 00:33:25,85
blatant and by holding that of the fork up on by the handle

279
00:33:25,85 --> 00:33:31,88
and controlling meet their actual body of the dramatic tool he would direct this fork at all over the surface

280
00:33:31,88 --> 00:33:36,1
and bring the surface, right down to the drafts,

281
00:33:36,1 --> 00:33:41,17
so that's what is known as Peyton for cut work natural gas in the harbour.

282
00:33:41,17 --> 00:33:45,11
The rock face, which was on the front are you now rock face that was different.

283
00:33:45,11 --> 00:33:51,76
There are no such procedure necessary in the producing the rock face that was a relatively simple operation.

284
00:33:51,76 --> 00:33:59,21
All you have to do was to pay attention to Leo cutting of the beds in the joints of the stone

285
00:33:59,21 --> 00:34:06,35
and they have to be worked down to work the drafts phoned the media.

286
00:34:06,35 --> 00:34:17,00
A recent don that library block of granite that was produced in that shed was faced up according to eight double there

287
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:22,03
was a top bid Bevel and the bottom bed Bevel and we had usually battles

288
00:34:22,03 --> 00:34:32,94
when are finishing off the face of a start on under I remember the year the bubbles were eighty degrees eighteen

289
00:34:32,94 --> 00:34:41,27
degrees what the bigger under the ninety degree without gas and eighty degrees founder,

290
00:34:41,27 --> 00:34:50,15
we had to cut the youth face of the stay on the rock face of that of the granite accordingly bubbles of most important,

291
00:34:50,15 --> 00:34:54,09
because if you observe the these structure of those pylons.

292
00:34:54,09 --> 00:34:55,6
I am not perpendicular

293
00:34:55,6 --> 00:35:02,69
but they are on a bevel that is what every individual stone was so cut it as a number of different levels as well

294
00:35:02,69 --> 00:35:06,27
because if you look at the at the front face onto the bridge.

295
00:35:06,27 --> 00:35:12,76
It starts up, but is an acute angle really gradually gets even more of trips and Cuba mat in

296
00:35:12,76 --> 00:35:18,66
and around the sides are slightly different accountability quite a number of different levels you are quite right,

297
00:35:18,66 --> 00:35:28,19
particularly the big stones down the base 's man told the pylon 's way were cut very acutely

298
00:35:28,19 --> 00:35:36,57
but they are very much bigger heavier than the stones that do worse a mounted on the yes that the bevelled did a very

299
00:35:37,05 --> 00:35:42,69
is also quite a number of key stones in the archers are part of the way up the pylons as well.

300
00:35:42,69 --> 00:35:44,9
It'll thought the shapes.

301
00:35:44,9 --> 00:35:55,22
Yes, indeed those keystones and to the magnificence the majesty of the stone structure, those keystones

302
00:35:55,22 --> 00:36:00,51
and all the various towns I forget these technical aim on that graduates

303
00:36:00,51 --> 00:36:06,71
but graduate up up on each side of Argentina will make on verge on the keystone.

304
00:36:06,71 --> 00:36:10,68
This is one of my arch of masonry to be able to draft out

305
00:36:10,68 --> 00:36:20,57
and cut accurately the arched islands did you work on any of the year of the stones for the vicinity after to know

306
00:36:20,57 --> 00:36:30,17
though it was stoned as I said earlier the Senate passed on was the cut in the better the quarry by a few upon deep Q.

307
00:36:30,17 --> 00:36:30,69
Did she.

308
00:36:30,69 --> 00:36:42,24
Oh, and it was finally our eye surfacing machine was taken into the union body and set up alongside this great though.

309
00:36:42,24 --> 00:36:48,09
Massive granite and the surfacing machine finish the star often in the bed of the quarry

310
00:36:48,21 --> 00:36:54,79
and I have nothing to do with that. It was also twenty Street in addition to the large alter Stonier talking about.

311
00:36:54,79 --> 00:36:57,3
There was also twenty three base stones.

312
00:36:57,3 --> 00:37:04,35
That's what I was asking whether you had in his ability never now know is mounted on twenty three stones underneath

313
00:37:04,35 --> 00:37:08,74
there is one of the stone on the top of this is news to me.

314
00:37:08,74 --> 00:37:08,92
Well,

315
00:37:08,92 --> 00:37:20,91
I can safely save it as a very creditable a monument to read Phil coming down that a cat that's the into Maria Arnaud I

316
00:37:20,91 --> 00:37:23,66
don't remember that particular day part,

317
00:37:23,66 --> 00:37:30,68
but I did see Doctor Brad feel on several occasions come down to visit the quarry with Mister Innis because you

318
00:37:30,68 --> 00:37:37,45
remember the quarry manager, indeed I do know if you don't mind me year tumbling myself

319
00:37:37,45 --> 00:37:46,63
and the speaking of the my dear irresponsible low in a way of life.

320
00:37:46,63 --> 00:37:54,18
I will enter into it as briefly as I can and I said earlier, though our family life had broken up under my father

321
00:37:54,18 --> 00:38:02,19
and I were living together in my life was more or less a life of negation of deprived a lot

322
00:38:02,46 --> 00:38:14,98
but my father being a Melbourne minded man who tried to make up for the loss of my mother founder to remember the

323
00:38:14,98 --> 00:38:23,26
quarry manager, yes I do only too well far as I stated earlier in our family life.

324
00:38:23,26 --> 00:38:28,47
Life had broken up and consequently I was very, very happy and myself

325
00:38:28,52 --> 00:38:36,25
and what we were arduous labile I had to face up to a day by day, plus the negation of my domestic life well,

326
00:38:36,25 --> 00:38:44,49
I was very upset young fellow pander far I have served about two and a half years of my time

327
00:38:44,49 --> 00:38:49,79
and I began to see you my future wife in the right perspective,

328
00:38:49,79 --> 00:38:55,66
namely nothing else would do well near slavery to my way of thinking, and I said the will.

329
00:38:55,66 --> 00:39:01,23
I'm going to get out of this slave shop and get away into the city were low.

330
00:39:01,23 --> 00:39:12,89
The work will be proper for me to become a finished craftsman found out what with what the what with radio Scotland are

331
00:39:12,89 --> 00:39:17,88
saying to me also unilateral use of the tools he is certainly

332
00:39:18,03 --> 00:39:24,25
but you're not getting enough experience to become a qualified unmanned properly of your best ideas to get away to the

333
00:39:24,25 --> 00:39:27,48
city will have a better chance well,

334
00:39:27,48 --> 00:39:37,51
I became so discontented in myself that I became were in different irresponsible rubble in other words, and under.

335
00:39:37,51 --> 00:39:40,16
I can see myself in the right perspective.

336
00:39:40,16 --> 00:39:47,52
Now I ought not to have conducted myself that way, but it was my only way out and so I wouldn't work.

337
00:39:47,52 --> 00:39:55,2
I used to doing my pleased and I caught of the disfavour of Mister Gilmore Borrie manager,

338
00:39:55,2 --> 00:39:59,69
manager of the quarry manager and Leo is executive staff,

339
00:39:59,69 --> 00:40:08,77
wherein the officer applied to the year to conciliation committee of the trade Paul that govern apprenticeship matters

340
00:40:08,77 --> 00:40:16,39
to her mind ventures counselled on the grounds of Llewelyn what will the terms of disobedience shallow fullness

341
00:40:16,39 --> 00:40:24,58
negligence which was entirely justified victory committee wrote back to me and asked me,

342
00:40:24,58 --> 00:40:30,38
I show any reason why my indents should not be cancelled and I wrote back and set I'd be very,

343
00:40:30,38 --> 00:40:35,54
very pleased if they were counselled and they were promptly cancelled Nick

344
00:40:35,54 --> 00:40:44,59
and I remember the day that Mister Gilmore are instructed that I come over in the office because I was a centre of fur

345
00:40:44,59 --> 00:40:52,31
disrespected disregard by all these Scots men and I felt though quite ashamed, but I have to face up to

346
00:40:52,43 --> 00:41:02,42
and I went on about a Nice edited subdued down first word out of his mouth were, what do you think of yourself

347
00:41:03,53 --> 00:41:13,07
and I said well, Mister Gilmore as far I can see it all for the best known research looked everyone your career.

348
00:41:13,07 --> 00:41:16,41
You'll never get recognise in Sydney.

349
00:41:16,41 --> 00:41:17,84
If you are stating this firm,

350
00:41:17,84 --> 00:41:24,43
you have been Arab enabler travel all over the world unacknowledged as a fully qualified the Mason and so forth.

351
00:41:24,43 --> 00:41:26,62
Now you now you've ruined it all.

352
00:41:26,62 --> 00:41:36,82
Well, Mister Gilmore said that all remains to be seen and I was only eighteen when I said that they and any help.

353
00:41:36,82 --> 00:41:40,81
I left them with a good race but crestfallen

354
00:41:41,19 --> 00:41:53,07
but I will say this though Mister Gilmore has a reputation unchristian believe are first class.

355
00:41:53,07 --> 00:41:57,36
but Of course the altercation I had with Mister Gilmore creates in my mind,

356
00:41:57,36 --> 00:42:06,32
another impression that under that in the was justified because it was bad.

357
00:42:06,32 --> 00:42:12,45
It was he was entirely justified in dispensing my services for reasons I've outlined

358
00:42:12,45 --> 00:42:24,42
but subsequently Mister Gilmore by all my father up and inveigle my father and

359
00:42:24,42 --> 00:42:32,63
or situation be wanted my father to condemn me, but my father being unknowable natured man

360
00:42:32,63 --> 00:42:40,79
and the democratic manner partly was he stood by me and he sue it back into the tea for Mister Gilmore for so doing.

361
00:42:40,79 --> 00:42:52,46
Mister Gilmore fact my father now is no justification whatsoever for so doing whatever little given well.

362
00:42:52,46 --> 00:42:53,77
I came to Sydney

363
00:42:55,22 --> 00:43:04,38
and it was indeed the saddest day of my life because I been associated with my father from birth up to eighteen years

364
00:43:04,38 --> 00:43:11,93
of age and we were living in the account up behind according.

365
00:43:11,93 --> 00:43:18,4
I know very well the set up camp were batching their founder.

366
00:43:18,4 --> 00:43:26,2
It broke my heart to have to say goodbye to my father up there during one lunch hour I was going up into the township

367
00:43:26,2 --> 00:43:31,22
to book my fear on the bus to narrow into Sydney are several more.

368
00:43:31,22 --> 00:43:33,94
I had to say goodbye to my file there and then

369
00:43:33,94 --> 00:43:48,7
and the iron I know now how my father 's heart breaking that they will my father was sacked not though being a native

370
00:43:48,7 --> 00:43:56,14
of the district. He will able to continue getting a livelihood pander.

371
00:43:56,14 --> 00:44:01,58
He went into a market garden which was on a farm immediately opposite,

372
00:44:01,58 --> 00:44:10,8
whether Quarry was not only was the family name was drawn draw out of my father took up wound their inform the market

373
00:44:10,8 --> 00:44:13,00
garden so he managed.

374
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:16,32
I wrote it management by when the Sydney

375
00:44:16,32 --> 00:44:28,11
and under Lizard won my real education began by year 's had no worm convictions in my wife being so young.

376
00:44:28,11 --> 00:44:40,16
I have no solid convictions about anything. One conviction. I did though take we must heart was oppression.

377
00:44:40,16 --> 00:44:44,22
I have seen my father 's wedding in the bush cutting logs

378
00:44:44,22 --> 00:44:50,92
and squirting sleepers I've seen in the out on the farms walking up

379
00:44:50,92 --> 00:44:56,73
and down between the rows of corn scuffling corn in the heat in the dust.

380
00:44:56,73 --> 00:45:02,74
I used to say to myself, well if ever I start work and can learn a few pounds, I should.

381
00:45:02,74 --> 00:45:11,46
I'm going to take some this burden off my father well to revert back I came to Sydney

382
00:45:11,46 --> 00:45:20,54
and Mister Gilmore is the prophecy was ill founded ill founded. Because I went to the union and the unit.

383
00:45:20,54 --> 00:45:27,34
Secondly, said the media Wally said that you completed completed two and a half years of your time

384
00:45:27,34 --> 00:45:33,61
and they don they didn't think they going to spoil your career as simple as all this, it said.

385
00:45:33,61 --> 00:45:43,67
I will draft a letter for you and you go out with this letter to Mister Ross at Waverley Cemetery and ROI.

386
00:45:43,67 --> 00:45:44,82
I took that letter

387
00:45:44,82 --> 00:45:53,83
and Mister Ross didn't hesitate to earth to engage me as his apprentice for the rest of my time on big strong

388
00:45:54,43 --> 00:46:00,1
and I finished my apprentice ship there in the monumental yard at Waverley Cemetery,

389
00:46:00,1 --> 00:46:05,3
where I had a good opportunity we or work during the depression.

390
00:46:05,3 --> 00:46:05,67
Yes,

391
00:46:05,67 --> 00:46:14,82
indeed I finished my partnership in the middle of the patient by storm in fully qualified men with years of experience

392
00:46:15,17 --> 00:46:21,58
coming in and out of that monumental yard making the right of employment.

393
00:46:21,58 --> 00:46:27,31
Nothing doing when I came alike time the depression was at its height.

394
00:46:27,31 --> 00:46:32,07
I have no choice but to go on the fall and can only dole for shillings

395
00:46:32,07 --> 00:46:38,37
and ten Penny Doll I went on that I have no choice

396
00:46:38,37 --> 00:46:50,71
but under it as if it is a tragic Kerr episode in my life I had a friend far he would perform on the Waverley Council

397
00:46:50,97 --> 00:46:54,97
but Wally Wally Evans by name Wally Evans,

398
00:46:54,97 --> 00:47:05,04
