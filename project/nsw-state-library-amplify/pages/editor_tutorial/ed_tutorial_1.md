# Welcome!

The transcript you are about to read was computer generated using speech-to-text software, so there are probably errors. This tool will allow you to listen to the oral history while you edit its transcript. Here's an example:

<video src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/togetherwelisten.nypl.org/video/twl_sample.mp4" preload="auto" class="toggle-sound sample-video" autoplay loop muted poster="https://s3.amazonaws.com/togetherwelisten.nypl.org/img/twl_sample.png"></video>
<p class="caption">An example of how the transcript editor works (click for sound)</p>

<span class="highlight">All your edits will be automatically saved</span> but may not be immediately visible by others. Once three or more people have transcribed – and agreed – on the text for an individual line it will be visible to all but no longer editable and will then become part of our official transcript.
