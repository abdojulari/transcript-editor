# Speaker Identification

Note the speaker for each line of a transcript by using the speaker identification button to the left of each line. **You only need to note when a speaker changes**. For lines with **multiple speakers**, select the final "multiple speakers" option. When you do not know the interviewer's name, select "interviewer" from the drop down options.
