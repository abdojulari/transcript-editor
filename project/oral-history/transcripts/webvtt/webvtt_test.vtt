00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Barry Solow> And it has begun to record so this is, uh, recording on March 17th,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Barry Solow> 2015 for the New York Public Library.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Barry Solow> Our Stories Project, an oral history of Washington Heights and Inwood. I am with

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Barry Solow> Aaron Scott in his apartment in Inwood

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Barry Solow> and we are going to talk.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Barry Solow> So, um, I think I said that the first question that we'd start with

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Barry Solow> would be just a brief history before you came

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Barry Solow> to Inwood. Just, uh, for orientation purposes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Multiple Speakers> We'll a very brief history. I'm almost sixty. Okay, well

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Multiple Speakers> OK. What started where you were born.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Multiple Speakers> You were born in Chicago. I was born in Chicago. Ah, um, very quickly...okay, I

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Aaron Scott> quickly, OK, born. Grew up, moved around 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Aaron Scott> went to different schools,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Aaron Scott> Berkley, uh College of Music. Joined the service, jumped out of airplanes.  Whoa!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Multiple Speakers> um, and uh, let's see. Not in that order it was join the service

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Aaron Scott> service and then went to Berkeley. Moved to France. That's a big story. And then, uh

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Aaron Scott> then I came here and voila.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Barry Solow> And, how did you make your living?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Aaron Scott> Music,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Aaron Scott> Always music. I've been very fortunate.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Aaron Scott> You know, I'm I suppose I'm rare.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Aaron Scott> Rare in that sense because I've always done pretty

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Aaron Scott> much what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do musically.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Aaron Scott> A lot, many people can't say that. I've always

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Aaron Scott> known very, actually since I was four, I've always known that one day

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Aaron Scott> I would play 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Aaron Scott> with great people so. Since I was four I was

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Aaron Scott> pretty much, honing my skills, just you know, being ready,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Aaron Scott> becoming ready

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Aaron Scott> for that moment. And of course it came. While I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Aaron Scott> was, uh, in France.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Aaron Scott> But uh, yeah that's that's pretty much. It.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Aaron Scott> I say that I'm uh fortunate and rare because

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Aaron Scott> many of us

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Aaron Scott> us are able to know what they want to do and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Aaron Scott> actually do it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Aaron Scott> the way that they'd like to do it. As

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Aaron Scott> As I, uh, as I played with my heroes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Multiple Speakers> and I played with almost all of my heroes. (Wow.) Except I did not, I did

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Aaron Scott> not play with Miles I did not play with uh Joe Zawinul

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Aaron Scott> although he did ask me to play with him.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Aaron Scott> At the time I was with McCoy and.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Aaron Scott> you know, I was with McCoy Tyner for

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Multiple Speakers> fourteen years, yeah. Wow. Fourteen years. And that's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Aaron Scott> That's no easy feat, you know. I mean, McCoy has played with

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Aaron Scott> All of my heroes, the best drummers in the world. And I was there fourteen years.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Aaron Scott> So am I the best drummer in the world? I would say

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
<v Aaron Scott> no. I wouldn't say that I'm one of the best drummers in the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
<v Aaron Scott> world but I would say I'm pretty good. [Laughs]

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.000
<v Aaron Scott> No,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Multiple Speakers> not pretty good, I'm very good. (Good!) I would say I'm very good. And we were

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
<v Aaron Scott> talking earlier about me, not talking about myself that much.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Aaron Scott> I've never, I never really felt good about talking about the things that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
<v Aaron Scott> I had done. Because I've done them. And everyone else, you know, makes more of a fuss about it than I do.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
<v Aaron Scott> But, uh, yes I think I've gotten to a point where I can start

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Aaron Scott> to say, you know, I've done some pretty interesting things. And I'm-I'm pleased

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Aaron Scott> with that. And I was fortunate enough to do it the way I wanted to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
<v Aaron Scott> do it, and that goes back to find not many people being able to make that claim.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Aaron Scott> And I'm still

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Aaron Scott> still pretty much doing things, uh, the way I'd like

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Aaron Scott> to do it. Even in my sixties.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Multiple Speakers> That's great. Or almost. I'm not there yet. Almost almost sixties, almost sixties.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Barry Solow> So, for a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Barry Solow> for a good portion of that part of your life, you were based in France

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Multiple Speakers> in France. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, France was only a three year.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Multiple Speakers> Oh I beg your pardon. Uh, let's, uh, eighty's, yeah only a three year episode

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Multiple Speakers> year episode. Um, oh but, [laughs] OK if we're going to talk about that. Sure.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Aaron Scott> Um, mmm, well, I, I just

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Aaron Scott> I had just graduated from Berkeley

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Aaron Scott> and moved to--moved to Paris. (Phone dings in distance)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Multiple Speakers> (It's me. I'm sorry, I should've muted that). Oh no, no no that's OK. I moved

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Aaron Scott> to Paris and--and, uh. You know here--here I

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
<v Aaron Scott> was, uh, I didn't speak the language

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Aaron Scott> I was with my wife I didn't speak the language. I didn't know anything about the culture

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Aaron Scott> the culture. No knew one--no, knew no one in

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Aaron Scott> the music community

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
<v Aaron Scott> music community in France, Paris.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Aaron Scott> So I just kind of dropped out of the sky, and, uhm, we

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Aaron Scott> got there, what – August.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Aaron Scott> August, August '85, I think,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
<v Aaron Scott> so August through

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Aaron Scott> December, um, my wife's uh parents. Well. Well. OK.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Aaron Scott> Was a was a, an author and another was a painter. They were both known.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
<v Aaron Scott> And I would help my, my wife's father uh, in his studio.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Aaron Scott> his studio. I would paint

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
<v Aaron Scott> his canvases white for him and he would give me something. You know it wasn't very easy.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Aaron Scott> August through December. But they were

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
<v Aaron Scott> just, the French government had just approved the creation

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Aaron Scott> of what they called the National Orchestra of Jazz and

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
<v Aaron Scott> it was a group for France and for French musicians

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Aaron Scott> and, to be run by the

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
<v Aaron Scott> French government and everything.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Aaron Scott> Well, I, let's see, I played

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
<v Aaron Scott> maybe two or three times while I was there. But nothing,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Aaron Scott> just you know. Jam sessions a mix of. Um, one of those jam

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
<v Aaron Scott> sessions I have to play with two of the members who were selected to be in that group. And the third time

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Aaron Scott> third time I went--or the second time I went uh, to see 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
<v Aaron Scott> to see the director, the music director, perform. And

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
<v Aaron Scott> I was told that I should speak with him but I didn't get a chance to speak with him, I just gave him a note.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Aaron Scott> A quick, you know, "Hi my name is Aaron Scott" and my phone number, a few people that I played with, you know,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
<v Aaron Scott> You know.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
<v Multiple Speakers> I tried to put the bigger names in, you know. (Sure) And uh, so

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Aaron Scott> And uh, so that was it. And as--as the

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Aaron Scott> As the money started to run out I'm thinking, you know, maybe it's time to go home. [Laughs] But

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Aaron Scott> But he called, the director, the music director called, and

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
<v Aaron Scott> He told me that he would like me to be a part of this group and I, I thought it

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
<v Aaron Scott> I thought it was a prank call, completely. You know, I mean, he didn't know anything about

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
<v Aaron Scott> anything about me, this is France

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
<v Aaron Scott> is France. For French musicians, you know.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Aaron Scott> And um, I put him off. I--I just--I just--This can't be serious, [laughs] you know

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Aaron Scott> You know it's time to go home. But um, you

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
<v Aaron Scott> know my wife kept prodding and I said OK OK OK. So I called.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Aaron Scott> And we met, and sure enough, he wanted me in. Now--now

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Aaron Scott> Now, now that was a problem,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
<v Aaron Scott> because uh, I'm not

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Aaron Scott> French, I'm American

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
<v Aaron Scott> I'm American. I'm black. I know.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Aaron Scott> And uh, here I'm going to be, you know, one of the chosen ones of

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
<v Aaron Scott> this French National Orchestra of Jazz.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
<v Multiple Speakers> of Jazz. You could not imagine the mess it caused in Paris. (Really?)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
<v Multiple Speakers> Oh, the press, it was awful [Barry laughs], horrible.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Aaron Scott> You know, the older guard just trashed me completely. Well, I

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Aaron Scott> mean who, I, they hadn't heard anything about me, nothing. They just

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
<v Aaron Scott> knew. You know, um, at one of the meetings, when it was finally official

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
<v Aaron Scott> official and all the members who were selected had a meet 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
<v Aaron Scott> a meeting with the media and I was there and everything, and you know, I was pulled aside

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Aaron Scott> in one of the, I think BBC or something that had someone on the

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
<v Aaron Scott> and asked me a few questions. They didn't even have who I play with right, but I--I completely

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
<v Aaron Scott> I completely you know I corrected them.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Aaron Scott> But uh, it was a big mess, even [laughs] months--months after

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Aaron Scott> Months after

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Aaron Scott> having performed with this group. Um

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
<v Aaron Scott> And you know we were traveling around France on tour

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Aaron Scott> tour, Africa and things like this. But

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But, this must have been three or four months into it. It was

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
a year contract. Three or four months into it, and we're playing somewhere.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And the next day I read the review. And the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
guy, you know, he talks about the--the band, it was a big band basically

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and basically, he talks about the band and he's, you know, giving praise and blah blah blah

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and blah blah blah blah blah. And he talks 

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
talks about the drama. And I'm saying "Oh, this is interesting," so he's just

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
"Oh, the drama was so good and blah blah blah blah blah" and he didn't

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
He didn't name

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
didn't name me, he named the guy who was supposed to do it in the beginning who refused to do

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
because he didn't want

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
to travel. (Laughs) (Claps) So basically, I'm even wondering if

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
the guy even went to

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
<v Multiple Speakers> the concert. [Both laugh.]

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
<v Aaron Scott> It's funny, but, but it took awhile. It took, you know, it took about, I don't know, a year.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
don't know, a year, for them to accept me. And we...I, I, 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I had a smaller group, and then, you know, I was in. I just

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I just played with everyone in France.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And that's where I met McCoy, basically. It took – let's see.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I was there when I, when I, when I was working with this big band

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
big band

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
band, um, McCoy was invited to play on one of the

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
of the pieces. We were in, where was it, oh Vienne, Vienne

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
in France. Beautiful, old

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Roman Coliseum. Beautiful beautiful beautiful.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
beautiful. Anyway, so we had this arrangement of one of

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
McCoy's pieces and, and you know I played. Well, we all played

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but at one point

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
point, uh, you know. He and I were kind of just playing together, and that

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And that was kind of the beginning, and then, you know, one of the groups that I played with,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
a trio. With 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
With ?Moct Cray and ?Michelle Venita

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
?Venita. Um, we were playing a festival somewhere. McCoy was playing afterwards

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
after us. And they were late. You know, I was thinking well that would be great. You know, McCoy could hear me,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You know hear me, I could talk to him, because I always wanted to play with

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
to play with McCoy.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And well he didn't, he didn't. They were late, like I said. They, you know, they traveled, which

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Which is a mess. Travel is really difficult. Yeah, people think being on the road is all glory. They don't

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
They don't have a clue what they're talking about. No idea [chuckles] whatsoever [chuckles]. It is hard

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It is hard work being on the road, hard work. If you're out

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
there, you know, six weeks to two months. And

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
you're just moving from city to city, you're jumping on planes, and once you get there

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
you get there you might have an hour and a half ride, you might have a

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
layover for an hour and a half in some godforsaken airport waiting for

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the next -- it's not easy. And then, you get there. You have a sound check. You have

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
You have a couple of minutes to eat. You

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
eat. You have to go get dressed. Then you go back to the vineyard, you play. And then you just sit because

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
just si t[laughs] because you're so exhausted. And then, you know,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
<v Multiple Speakers> you repack. You get ready to leave, and then... [Interviewer: "So what made it worth it?"] 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
<v Aaron Scott> That's what I love to do. Are you kidding me? And it's not, you know – I'll get

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
back to the story, but it's not, uh

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
not, uh [sighs]. Music

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Music. It's, it's, it's, it's a very important thing. It's not just me performing. I really don't

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I really don't care if people like me or not, I really don't care

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I really don't care. But I do know that what I 

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
What I do can affect people

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Can affect people positive...positively or negatively, and most positively

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000
often positively. I know that. Um, and that's why I play. I don't play

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I don't play for me, I don't.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
don't. I don't play for, for the glory or for the recognition. I

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
really don't. I play to make people feel good, to help them.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
You know, when you, regardless if there are twenty people

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
or

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
four thousand people. You know, you, you, you can see they

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
They come in, especially in clubs where it's more intimate, they come in. You know, they're distracted or whatever

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
distracted or whatever. They come to forget, yhey come to go somewhere, to be transported

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Multiple Speakers> somewhere to, to enjoy, to relax, you know, [Interviewer: "yeah"] and if you can do that

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that, then when you've done your job. It's

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
not "Look how good I am," you know, "Look at me, I am so

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I am so handsome. I'm such a handsome man" [Laughter]

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
man" [Laughter]. It's not that at all. It has nothing to do with that

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
it. You know, it's not about me at all – but to get back to the story. OK,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
so, so, so.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Where was I? But anyway. Anyway.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
McCoy, right.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Multiple Speakers> [Barry] uh, uh- [Aaron] right, right [Barry] being on the road- [Aaron] so, so- [Barry] yeah

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Yeah. We play before Macoy he was late and.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I did get a chance to. It was the drummer's birthday, Lewis says it was his birthday.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So we hung out on the Internet that was so much fun, oh, it was so much fun

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Lewis-

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Once you get to know some of your heroes it can be either a joy or a pain in the

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
in the

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
in the butt [chuckles] because not all of your heroes are really nice people

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
You know. But the majority of them are and

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the ones that are really, really worth admiring

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
are the quiet ones, not the noisy ones.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
The noisy ones, you know, they uh-

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
they, they have issues

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The quiet ones have nothing to prove.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
[Barry]Yeah. [Aaron]You know.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And I pretty much stayed with the quiet ones [chuckles]. I didn't

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I didn't like to be with the noisy ones too much 'cause that's, you know, I'm - I'm not a noisy

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
noisy person. [Barry]No, I-I didn't get that impression. [Aaron] You know, no, I-I stay with the quiet ones

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But uh, at one point I-I-I think

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I'm out of sequence, but McCoy came to

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Paris with the 

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
the best musicians in the world, you know

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
between shows I walked right up to him and said "you know, McCoy, this event had been

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
this event after we played a little bit but that, that uh-

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
French national thing. And, uh after we'd uh-I spent 

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
the evening with uh - his drummer at the time, Lewis Hayes

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
walked right up to McCoy, I said "You know McCoy,  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I would like to play with you- I'd like to work with you."

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You know, th-there's a ph-a-phrase in-in France, I'm gonna say it

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
because it's a little gross but

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
basically, you know, they're here.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
here [laughs]. You know, instead of down, they're here, you know, and that's where I was

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And I walked right up to him and you know, yeah, you know McCoy [laughs]

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
[laughs]

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I'd like to work with you in- you know, um-

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:00.000
people [Barry]I may have to annotate that for the listeners. [Aaron]oh- [hearty laughter]

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
No, but uh- you know people would come to town um

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
[?] would come to town and I'd work with him, I mean, you know, so word had

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000
gotten to McCoy anyway, you know, that there was this guy in France and ba ba ba ba ba. Well, um, it took

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that took a little while

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
but uh, McCoy gave me a call, you know you get

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000
you get that [Barry that's great, yeah] that call. And it's like seriously, really, damn-[laughter]

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
[laughter] And it was very nice because

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
uh- ok, so I flew to London. And it was just

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
McCoy and I in the studio we played for

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I guess about an hour and a half. Something like that

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
in fact I was playing with someone and-and now that I remember - the night before in Leone

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Leone, in the middle of France, and I flew from Leone to uh-

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
You know, OK, anyway um- you know, It was like, that-that was the audition

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and it was done.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And then that's it- no more to talk about that. I mean um, the first

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
first year we played a bunch. The next fourteen, thirteen years

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
we played a bunch more [laughter]

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Multiple Speakers> Now- [Barry]but that was, that was all around the world

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I mean, no, you know, like I said I don't like

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
talk about these things but, you know I played in the greatest

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
halls in the-in the world, I have

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
of two thousands, you know, and I.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
play two tens, [laughter] like, you know, I mean, I'm not gonna say it was

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
it was always, you know, thousands and thousands, but, you know, and, um, I'd like.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
the intimate setting and I also like the large

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
setting, um, outdoor, I like playing outdoors because 

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
then you can - I try to play to the-the person in the back of the room, however

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
far that is so-you know [laughter] quarter of a mile away

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I want to try to play to them, you know, but um

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yeah

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
That was, that was pretty much what I, what I did, you know.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Now how does, how does this relate to Inwood? OK, so I've been living in Inwood these years

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
years uh, since

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
what did I say before? 1990 [Barry] yeah. [Aaron] 1990 [Barry] yeah. [Aaron] Right

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT. RIGHT. 1990 I moved to Inwood uh, Riverside and.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
? um, yes? [Barry]What-what decided

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
<v Barry Solow> you on Inwood at that point?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Sublet apartment. [Barry] The availability of the apartment. [Aaron] Right

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
That was it. [Barry]Yeah. [Aaron]You know, I-I'd been, you know I-I

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Barry, I tried to commute from Paris for you-

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Laughter]

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:05.000
[Laughter] [Barry]Yeah that wouldn't have worked well [Laughter]

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I did, you know

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
you know I really did for a year I was on the plane with [?]. Go back to France 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
yeah, um, but um, it was a bit much

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
and, and uh- you know I decided to OK, well I guess it's time to

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
come back stateside... But uh,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
oh!

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
oh, are you kidding me- the food, the culture, I mean everything, every- na

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
it's interesting

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
now I might tread some touchy waters here but, um

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
you know uh, the quality

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000
of life, for example, um...the 

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
awareness

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
of a population, politically or whatever

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I mean, I realized when I was in France, you know, they have uh

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
uh- their political system is

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
completely left

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
to completely right and everything in between.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
We just have, like, right and more right. That's all we have here. [Barry: yeah]

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
you know, but, everything in between

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
completely left to completely right. And I was fascinated because, you know

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
It, it, I- I had never known anything like that

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and everyone in

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
the street understood what was going on politically. It was none of this, uh,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
You know someone would say something on television and you go "oh. Since it's on television 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
it must be true." [laughter] you know

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
You knwow like it's done over here. Yeah.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
But

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
I mean not. Not just that but many many many other things that you just don't

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
find many many other things. Now yes they have

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
problems every. Less. There are people. You have problems. Yeah.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
You know. But they were

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
just so many revelations.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
The Mona Lisa. For

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
example. Oh that. That hurt the most the Mona Lisa that would that would

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
hurt the most. Because you know. I'd love all kinds of love

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
or any type of art I really love. Well.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I'll have to clarify that some day

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
I'm sure. I

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
But you know. So you. You're going through your studies and you're

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
looking at August. Fabulous work by having people. You know. And you finally get a chance

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
to see

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
it right in front of you thinks. No nonsense you know.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Here it is depth and.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
You know

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
to have this great anticipation because you're

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
going to see this country. Working there signs Mona Lisa arrows you

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
know how. Then it takes about. I don't know

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
some minutes several minutes to get there. You finally get it is a crowd of thirty people or

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
so yeah. And you have to review way to the front

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
and I get there. And I'm

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
like wait wait. It was

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
like only this big. And I've always thought it was this huge seven little bit

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:41.000
you know. Resisted like and. Wow.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
I

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
think

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
it's

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
also there you go. Reality is you know better than fiction I guess. At

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
least straighten you out. But how does this you really lead to him with OK

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000
so my team and yes.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Pretty

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
much I was still and it out. You know. We were busy

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
for

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000
a Navman and a half months a year. Yeah. So I was in and I don't.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
When I moved here to protest. He sed.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
That's when I recognized Mr Meadows and the garden and everything and

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
that's when I started to become involved in but.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.000
You

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
don't mind if I don't talk about awards and stuff like that you talk about what you want to talk about.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:40.000
I don't have to talk about it but.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.000
I

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
found it just so cool that. There was a person like Mr Ramos. In

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000
the neighborhood. Now. Especially for me because they're not that many black men.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Of his

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
stature. In the neighborhood. Yeah I can say.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
So it was kind of personal because we had that I

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
think with what if the disk. Every city area. I mean we could

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
share things because we had a common culture. I mean if and if it had.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
It's funny

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
but. So. So I see.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
You know I've always been the baby.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
And it didn't. Most of

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.000
the settings where there are people I'm always the youngest.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Even the groups that I played of I was the youngest mostly.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Except for the French bad because we're all about the same

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
age. The National Orchestra. Jest

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
of. So

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
it was just normal for me to see

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
him. And for heat for him to see maybe. Because I

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
that older younger relationship was easy for me. Yeah. It was very

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
easy and. He was doing such incredible things I had. And

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
that the longer I knew him the more Mason became by him

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
because I mean people don't think about if I'm pointing over here

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
I'm pointing to outside now. To the Glad to the no to the park. To talk

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
to the particles of the poor people. You know they look at

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Bruce's garden may think that's the crowning achievement of all of his

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
work. Forty five years. You know. Plus he's been

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
doing this. That's like half of his life half of the man's life he's

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
been beautifying. The neighborhood. I mean think of what he's done.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:55.000
You know. I mean at the time when he came there were gangs here. You know. Of.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
He

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
convinced the gangs to help. He convince the gangs to.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
You know do better with this their lives. You know

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
he the and other

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
other civic groups. Combined are responsible for.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Why I should park looks the way it does today. You know.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
He is responsible for the Green Streets. He and his wife.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Of course I was possible for cleaning up the Bruce's garden. I mean Bruce's garden was

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
probably or the area Briscoe's probably the

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
worst of the.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Negligence. Because the neighborhood. Sort of pitched

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
in and everything they pitched it everything he was a dump.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
was adopted was a dump Yeah. But the park was also neglected.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Because the gangs just trashed it so hard. The you know they would put him. They

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
would replace the benches that would burn down and they would be burned out again so the.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Park surprisingly like they don't know what to do with this. But Mr knows another.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
You know like my Civic communities got together and it was.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
We have what we have now.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And there are many more things many many more things. Not much of

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
this is being talked about. If any. They talk about

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Bruce's garden.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Which is beautiful don't get me wrong right. If you proof of God is beautiful. But there's

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
so much more to it and it all of I should

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000
park. The memorial garden the moral slope on the site the gang culture eat.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
The people you know I want to point we had a chance in flipping in the underbrush.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
On the Broadway. Quarter. You know

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
I mean it's

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
just not being talked

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
about and. I find that a bit disturbing. I hope it's not just because

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
he's black. You know. I find it disturbing.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Because some other groups of coming. In the

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
meanwhile that

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
it's you know they haven't spent very much time. And everyone talks about what

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
they do. But it doesn't even

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
pale to the scope of what Mr Milosevic I mean stand.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
You know that test. That's a little disappointing I have to say. I guess

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000
it's just me. He just says where we are.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
But anyway how does that relate to me

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I. You know

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I've always loved.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Nature that. I mean I grew up in a city but you could plug

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
me anywhere. Basically. Even a desert. If you'd

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
given the proper equipment. I don't just want to turn to

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
people.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
But you know I don't I

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000
could be in the desert for little while or or the mountains or anywhere.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
I just enjoy nature. I enjoy the planet. I love the place.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
You know this is the only home I know.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yeah. Now. The

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
only home I know. And if you know

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
it's it's too bad it's really too bad that most

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
of us don't get to travel and see different things to see how different.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
People live in different areas of the planet.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
You know it's it's really too bad because it's such a such a learning experience.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
It really is.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Because yes I've been called on over the world. I mean I haven't played everywhere. I mean

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
it's a big planet. That I've I've covered quite a bit.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And unfortunately like. You know as as I said before. When you're out

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
there for

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
six weeks a month. You don't have a lot of time

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
to stop and look around. So what do you do when

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
you get to airports. You observe other people you know. People walk

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
differently in different parts of the world. You know that they hold themselves differently they carry

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
themselves

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
differently. And the foods and you know everything.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And when you do have a time to stop and relax for a few days. Then sure

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
you just take it all in but. But travel. It's just indispensable.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:51.000
And it's unfortunate that more people thought OK. Back to the story.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
So

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000
as of. As my fourteen year tenure. Came to a close.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Because I started working. I start. Music program

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
in Harlem. At a school a public school. It was very it was going

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
very very well. I've

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
always said I've always

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000
been able to organize and facilitate always always always.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
I've never really focused on those skills.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
They just sort of came out. When I you know I thought of something and like

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
putting this music school together. Or this this music program together just for the place

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
because I saw clearly what needed to be done in did the things that needed to be done and.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
If I saw a problem I try to find a solution. You know. Very simple. So that's

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
how I approach things. If it's. I mean I'm looking at something.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
If there's a problem for the solution. And then keep going. You know. And

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
by all

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
means stay the course. Stay the course.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
You know. And that comes from my.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
My ability to focus because as I told you since I was four I

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
do what I want to do. But that meant what I practiced. I really really

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
practiced. I'm jumping around a bit I'll get back to it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
But when I was in the service for example. I

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
was practice so much. The guys would throw me out of

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
the the

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
building. They take that stuff down the

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
street so I take my drug good on the street.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
You still do.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
I

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
say oh you know I mean you you you just. You really become

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
consumed by by your involvement.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Yeah. And I've always been like that.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And probably will until I begin losing it. You know. But.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So what I have protests something it's pretty complete. I mean I put everything in.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And it's never about me.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
You know that's why

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I don't like talking about my you know.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Accomplishments of the things that I've done it's not about me. You know. I lived it. And

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
I can look back and figured I was really nice. I had a great time. And I

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
did. I really did. Well that's great you know if I did

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
it but you know. OK.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
But someone else talk about. It's not important because there's something else

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:58.000
that I you know. Would rather talk about or focus on. You know. No.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:07.000
You know. Other things coming at the same time.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So the focus yes when you know when I'm in practice or

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
composed of in the beginning when I can possibly.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
He was a. Again. While I was in

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
the service

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I lived in I went away from the base because I didn't want to do the army

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
thing yet twenty four hour sort of drive an hour and a half to and from.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000
You know. So that means a formation at six I was up at four. Well. Hey.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
meant.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I did not want to do the everything. You know twenty four hours. But. So I was

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
staying in Chapel Hill and working on the piece there was

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
a

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
piano in the permit which was attached. Attached

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
to another hole. We have to spread the news.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And I was trying to work out. Section.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And when you get so focused. Everything blocks up everything is gone. I don't see

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
anything I'm just really you know.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Doing it and I'm just trying to work it out. And I

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:23.000
hear what

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
you

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
and I live up surprise you know. Because I had no idea how long I've

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
been doing it you know I guess

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000
it was like listening to those two notes of Beethoven Beethoven trying

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:41.000
to figure out what to do with or I was you know.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
I was so I bought a beta of that but trying to say it

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
because what a sweet. But the

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.000
focus. The focus it. It really has helped me through my life

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
and no.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
After when I was at the school in Harlem. I became ill and that kind of not to be

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
done for several in the previous almost eight

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
years. But I'm slowly. Still slowly. Bouncing back.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
But my focus know. Is on the

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
curtain. And if

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
it wasn't my choice. I very high. When I

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:31.000
saw that. You know it.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
When I saw what was happening. It was just thinking.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
You know I I really don't want to do this. I would I

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
would lean on the garden center at night and look into it

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
just so please don't give me this I don't want it because it's huge it's

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
huge it's. You know it's there been defining

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
moments in my life in everyone's life you have them.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
But things are so huge you just have to

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
really. Sit back and fill bored.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I can do this. This is. This is too big for me. You know.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
But some of the very was said to me.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
She

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:23.000
said. A job is only as big as you

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000
are now.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
So what is your role in the garden. What's my row.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Yes. Oh my.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
What is my

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
rule is that the same I don't know

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Mr

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
REYNOLDS. Well. I mean in in brass tacks term.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
What. What do you have to

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
do with a garden.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Everything. No I am not. I cannot

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
say I have been to Mr Mills because you can't replace

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
someone like that and I would never never.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You know. Hint that I have the new system.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Not because he's you know he's really

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
exceptional. Maybe one day I might be very exceptional.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Maybe one day we'll see.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
But my role in

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.000
the garden is to of.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Do the best I

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:45.000
can

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
to keep this a little

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
direction and and legacy. Going forward. The best

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
I

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
can. And that involves organizing people.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Oh yeah. Of course. I

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.000
mean. There's a lot of I'm not saying.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
But the

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
garden is only twenty percent of what needs to be done.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
And that is a whole lot of work over there across the street that. It's

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
not growing. You know. Project you're always in the

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
garden. But that's only twenty percent. And people don't

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
realize you know. So

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
all whole nother world a whole other ballgame going

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
on that. Also needs to be addressed. If it's going to be done properly.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
What are some of the things people don't understand about the

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
garden. Well the first

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:53.000
of mistake. Is that it's always closed.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Now that there are there may be something to that. The fact that I

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
know personally.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
The past year and a half.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
The curtain was mostly open all the time. Now. If you

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
were walking to work. And then walking home. You might see

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
the

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
gate closed. Because you're leaving before. Seven min.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
You coming home after fuck. Friend. You know but if you are around during the

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
day. And you still make the claim that would not be an

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
artist claim to make. Not by a longshot. The Guard has

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
been open.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
And this year. It is a hopefully who will go along those

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
lines as well. Last

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.000
year there were a lot of events that took place and I don't.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:58.000
And there's always been events in the garden.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
But

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
how can I say the atmosphere.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Or the conditions that created the

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000
garden. No longer exist.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
The conditions that created the good well. It's no longer a dump. They're no longer gangs.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
You know destroying everything. There's a fence around the garden which protects it

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
because in fact the fence was put up by the Parks Department of the.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
The and chain link fence was put

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
up. Oh it could be.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Be searched but Iraqi government should my stuff and find it.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Take me about ten minutes though. But I

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
don't know was put up by the parks. The parks permit because you know at

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
the time they felt that the work needed to be protected. Breakers without

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
the fence.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
You know the dogs were going in the kids were running to the far flower beds you

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
know and. Bruce and Mr Reynolds and members

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
that were helping. You know they were really trying to do good work. There used to

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
be a gardener. Assigned to us you

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
park who eventually left because the gang would

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
just continuously trash is work. I

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
mean yeah. Who doesn't just say it's not worth it after a while yet you

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
know. But OK so the fence went

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
up

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
and and seen the conditions they don't exist. So the fence would up.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
What else.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Well

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
now we have water. Again. I guess in the sixty's there was water.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And the sixty's was when the parks

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
trashed. So during the. The rehabilitation of Asian park.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
You know the contractors came in

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
and redesigned the park. But they failed to use. Water.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
know. So now. The what's back. After thirty years you how to

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
use something like that but OK heredity. And it's a great length. I mean you kidding me. Of course it's

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
a great thing I had. You my you may have known there was a petition.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Put up.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Of concerning the water project I said.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
But it was not against the water project it was just how the

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
water project would go through the garden in Honestly honestly honestly. You know

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I I've you know I understand this is Parks property. I

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
understand it. But there's a lot of great work that's been going

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
on for half a century.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Three work. You know.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Good work. Yeah. Really really good work for the community.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
It's statically it's changed the face of the neighborhood. Absolutes change the face of.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
You know how people relate to each other you know. I mean it's not just

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
visual but it's social it's everything. You

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
know. So it's not that I feel like

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
or or I see you ask me what's my role so it would be me.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
It's not like I feel like I own that property or

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
I'm not it's ridiculous. It's parks property I just and I completely. But the work

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
that's going on is is worth

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
preserving. And how is that endangered right now.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Oh well. The water project. So can the fence right. Which was good

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
because you know. You can't. There's a there's a rock shelf. Along the from the garden

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
the eastern face.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Just like there was that the building they made. That burned down onto a seventh

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
and Broadway. When they started digging sort of rocks Rice out of what they had to go to

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
through was the same along the front the Eastern front of the

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
garden and that just would have been a mess it would be ruined the garden would have been more.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
I'd say of a third. Third of the garden. Would be in ruins

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
for two two years.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Well. OK So that novel was

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
one that was one that was one. But there's also.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
There's also talk which is. You know it's been published by the parks apartment that they would like to

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
take down the fence.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And you know that's just not a good idea because the. The

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
work that being done would be ruined everything would be trashed

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
within two months. To it would it would you wouldn't take very long at

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
all you know what's needed is a. You know the

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
continuation of the wrought iron fence. That's what you really needed. There's

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
the Parks Department say why they want the fence to come down.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Well there was there was a. They wanted

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
to make it like Strawberry Fields and

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
in Central Park. You know. More accessible. More acceptable but.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
But you know I mean. Well there are plenty

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
of gardens that are gated in

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
the city. You know why single this one out. You

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.000
know it. And this is probably no I have to say.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Gravity park is his family fabulous and there are other.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Rose garden is in the Rose Garden in Central Park and. Another fabulous gardens

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
but this is a very very very unique garden. Sure it's

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
very unique. And it's it's worth showcasing

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
not destroying.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
You know. And taking the fence down. You would be destroyed.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
What's my

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
role of protector seems part of What's my

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
role of. Yes. What's my role as I

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.000
said to the best I can to keep Mr REYNOLDS. Legacy going

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
for using all things that are available to

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000
be legal and without. You know I'm a

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.000
crazy.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
But. So that's that's where we are and the. The direction.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Mr Mills loves the direction the disco and. You know you. Couple years

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
ago he had a problem with the direction but he loves the direction it's going

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
in now. You know and he and I work very closely. We've been working

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
very closely

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
for the past two years now. You know.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Very very closely I do nothing without his approval. You know.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Or at least is important.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
You know I defer to him because it. There is

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
something to to. You know.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
That's something that you don't have that much in the older cultures.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
The older. As in the

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
cities

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:05.000
of of back of of of.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
I

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
you know there's there's a reason that the older people are

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
respected and

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
revered that reason doesn't exist in this

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:22.000
culture or. You know the.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
I don't know I'm not going to start a cultural war so I'll just leave it there.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
But you know. The elders are not reviewed here. They're stuck in

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.000
nursing homes and drugged. You know. The important ones.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.000
The fortunate ones are at home.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
DRUG.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
That's I'm sorry I'm sorry sir but but that's not that's

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
really sad. That's really sad. I mean. Here's a man.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Mr REYNOLDS.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
You know he became ill. Thousand and eleven two thousand tend to be

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
like that the end of two thousand two

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000
hundred people were so quick to write him off. You know.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
He had dementia. Brother the above

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:18.000
about. I mean if these things were true. Four years later. You know.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
He's going to stay as well he's my dad one. Of course

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
but hell I want to be like that in ninety one. You know.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Have you heard the. You know history demanded here. Because he was quite cultured.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
You know it's

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.000
it's it's just that. You know. Here look you look at television.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000
There on the fashion and everything is is geared toward the young

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000
and all the cars and everything. And what's geared toward us. Pills.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
We get them to with those meds. And if you listen very quickly because side effects

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
you don't.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
OK.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000
OK Enough enough. During

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000
But no I I defer to him

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.000
because I respect his wisdom. And he is brilliant.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Don't tell the full.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
He's brilliant. Which only comes across and. And I I

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000
am trying to get as much of that as I can while a

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Q.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
so has. So in would has been a good place for you to

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
life with my family

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
my children my children grew up here.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
They. You know this is a. This is an interesting little

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
corner especially where we are now. You're on the Hill. No one comes up here

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
unless you live here. If you stay on the Hill. If you

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
want crazy you just go down

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
the hill.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000
No mam and it's not that crazy is only a W. It's the rest of

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
the island is what

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
I mean to say it sure you know. I mean if you want you know. Excitement you

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:19.000
just you know. Go down the hill. But when you're up here.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Use is. You sit in the garden any time of the day. And all you hear a birds

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
in airplanes.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
That's it all day. Yep that's it all day. If I mean

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
who knows who goes into the. The the. The woods of

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
of in what who

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
park. But when you go back

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
there. You just your birds you don't even hear the airplanes. Because the trees.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
You

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
know. I mean that's how

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
how wonderful the series is. And it needs to

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000
be maintained a minute and was are preserved. Just like

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000
this and I. I gather you think it's fairly unique in New York.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Oh there it's. It doesn't even seem like New York. I mean we're on the island

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
of Manhattan and. You know people come up.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
They

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
visit. As though they're going

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:20.000
to different cities. You know in a couple of years. It's it's a.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I'm sure developers on this. I'm sure they do. And mean you

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
know this is about making money

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
for example. But if a kid the. If you could be preserved

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
as long as possible. For those of us who are

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
here and those of us who are here after

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
you're here and sort of so forth. I think that would be a great thing.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
I think would be a great. So how was it raising a family here in

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:59.000
England.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Dramatic Pause. I. I've

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
no idea. It's only a post because

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:13.000
of the education. OK. School system appears. Horrible.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
So we you

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
know. Is it may have become more difficult for parents

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
to take the children. For the day of the island.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
You know we have to find a school and we finally

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
we we did pretty

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000
well with the two that occasionally

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
but living in the neighborhood. This is what their backyard.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Big backyard here. Of it's quiet. There's no through traffic.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
You get the occasional boom box or or

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
car radio. On the cul de sac

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000
but. But pretty much as I said you know. The next you live

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
here you know come up here. Yeah. And I mean the

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
the children have done very well you know. We at

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000
the very well.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.000
I'd. I was not here. During during the.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.000
The Cultural on the rest.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000
So I didn't experience the same thing as Mr Reynolds family

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
experience

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
of. And see that's the other thing I respect him so

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
much

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.000
because he is basically a trailblazer for me.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I would not have been able to do the things that I've done. In my

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
lifetime and have not been for him because he's a performance well.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Yes or other people like him.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
It's just very simple. I would not have been able to do those things. And I understand

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
very clearly. And I appreciate it.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Period so he is an elder in. In the old fashioned sense of that darling. Most

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
of that for me. Yeah. For me. But now it's like what you're saying is also for the

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000
community as a whole. Well. Well. Of whether they're you know what or

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
not if. If you consider this. The

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
village of. I would say yes. You

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
know of the tribal thing

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
would.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Or at least the tribal. You know the. The Hill area. You

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000
know of many of you will not be. Will not

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:43.000
probably not being like being referred to as part of a trial. I get that but.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Yes. I mean there. It's. It's really unfortunate you always of

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
those those pockets of malcontents. You know. Always

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
always always and. I understand you know

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
I my

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
father took me on those demonstrations in Chicago

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
with Dr King. You know I've seen. Really vicious

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
nasty things.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Directed directly to admit. Yeah. I've seen the. The worst

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:24.000
of racism I've seen in the standard. Yeah. But.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:33.000
But getting past that. I mean.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Will

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
you have people around

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.000
you that. Really

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:47.000
assist in your development in your evolution. Because we wrote.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Constantly evolving. Of free for the better of it

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
and of ways. Some of us get stuck.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.000
But when they're those around us. That.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Improve your

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000
chances. They should be listened

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
to

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:16.000
the issue be listened.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
So how do you see the future of

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:26.000
anyone.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:34.000
With that be with the flying automobiles or not.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
The you

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000
mean short term or long term well. I'll let you interpret it isn't a way

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
we

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:45.000
want. You know the future needs you give me you throw me a ball an

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.000
alternative spend it till I can find an answer.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Or O.T.B. twenty different.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Well

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:09.000
it's interesting. It's interesting. I would hope.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000
I would hope

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.000
that. Those who live

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:22.000
here in this area.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Become or are constantly

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
involved in protecting their.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:33.000
I would hope that that would happen. It's not happening right now.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.000
You have a lot of. You know like I said. There are always welcome to.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
And there are those who think your vision sucks. You know that their vision is much

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:50.000
better. But you have to let the work speak for itself.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000
If your work is bad then your vision is that if the work is

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
good in the vision must be good and. It's that simple.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.000
It's really that simple. If.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
If the community of holds fast

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and sticks together.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know. Two to keep their community.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
A certain way then there should be no problem. To keep it

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
that otherwise it'll just become another

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
neighborhood. With foreign cars and and

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
you know it will probably be a through street. The to that

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
article the second make it through. Through Broadway so you know. Easier access

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and the buildings will get taller all of these will be torn down. Because a to hold them.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You know you don't lose that. That intimacy.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So I guess. When I hear you saying is that the tribe of Inwood It's

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
to understand better understand it's not better as an orchestra.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Well that would help. The infighting should stop. But

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
you know. That's not going

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
to happen.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I. His log is there are people

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
there will be infighting. You know. But. But there should be a common.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
A common goal to common ground at least.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
You know.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And you think we're lacking. Right now. And that

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
at the moment I would say yes. Given given any situation.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Or any proposal you'll probably have a dozen or

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000
so rather than two or

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.000
three

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:53.000
and. Do you see a force that can change that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
While Perry.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I didn't say I was going to do you think.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Oh goodness. Oh yeah well. We can be done with everyone I meet.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Because I thought a couple of minutes ago is a good place to stay.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Oh. Mug of. What was what well question. The politicians do it.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Well.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Well I guess my question to been in general for you to look

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
ahead with respect to what and.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And what you see and. I gather from what you've said

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
that you see different possibilities depending

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
on which impulses in the community prevail.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And I guess. I want to know if you have any idea

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
of how one impulse might prevail over another. What

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
the forces are might determine

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
that one

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
one zero zero zero zero another team that

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000
the in post part. I will say

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000
that

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
this. This area. As a bright future could be beautiful it could

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.000
remain beautiful it. The possibilities are endless. I can say that.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
With with the proper foundation. As a community.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
The possibilities are in this.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I mean it's already natural beauty when beautiful we have such a great resource here.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That should be admired and destroyed.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It should be a

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
place that neighborhood. Not just you know just being on my.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Involvement and. You know in the soil. But I mean

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
the neighborhood. Can always

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
retain its intimacy and beauty.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Only if there's a collective push to do

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
so otherwise forces will come in and munch away.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And they'll be nothing left.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
OK. I'll say that you know that is that. That's that's fine that's a good thing to say here.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So this is an oral history project and. It is my

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
hope that it's a resource such that fifty years ago. For years

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
from now. Historians or people who are interested. Will be listening to

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
these Reporter years

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
from know the one hundred ten.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Of this it. Arbitrary figure out

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000
of so I've given that as a as a a final note. What.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:09.000
What about in would should someone. Understand. Fifty years from now.
